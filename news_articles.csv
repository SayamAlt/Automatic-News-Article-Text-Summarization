0,The British island stuck in time,"The map of the British Isles is a cornucopia of islands, many of which are so transporting and preposterous they almost seem like make-believe.

Cradled by the Ardnamurchan peninsula in Scotland, Eilean Shona inspired Peter Pan author JM Barrie to dream up Neverland – tidal Loch Moidart on which it sits is almost a magic mirror. Another Scottish island, Inchconnachan, has an almost unbelievable population of wallabies, a marsupial predominantly native to Australia and New Guinea. Adrift off Anglesey in Wales, meanwhile, is Llanddwyn Island – the so-named ""Island of Love"", where the Welsh celebrate Saint Dwynwen, the country's patron saint of lovers.

And then there is a place in the Channel Islands – the scattered archipelago of British dependencies hooked off the coast of Normandy, France – where horse-drawn carriages are still a necessity and tradition comes over like the conventions of a Jane Austen novel.

This is the cherished island of Sark: a recently-changed fiefdom that's still caught in medieval times.

Sark is the archetypical English seaside escape. Just three miles wide by 1.5 miles long, it is fringed by pale beaches and alive with the possibility of shore fishing and boat trips. Seabird-nested cliffs tumble to frothing waves, and its rural lanes are flanked by orchards, hedgerows and walled gardens pollinated by honeybees. There's an ice cream shop overlooking Creux harbour, draft horses in emerald-green fields and sheep racing in summer. At nightfall, the Milky Way hangs low to meet the naked eye.",https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20221206-the-british-island-stuck-in-time,2022-12-06T00:00:00
1,Can younger workers speak up without managers bristling?,"As millennials and Gen Zers make up more of the workforce each year, there’s one big difference emerging that sets them apart from their predecessors. Unlike the generations that came before them, these younger workers are more eager to be heard in the workplace, whether that’s suggesting improvements or innovations; questioning salary and benefits, such as flexible working; and even pressing on larger issues, such as company values and diversity.

""Recent entrants into the workplace do seem a lot more comfortable talking about flexibility, work-life balance, fairness, about the kinds of expectations they have for their working lives, compared to older generations,"" says Martin Kilduff, professor of organisational behaviour at University College London. That’s even true of his own recent hires for research assistants, he says: ""They're a lot more vocal – in a positive way. They let you know what they're thinking.""

Yet while younger workers want to be heard more than ever, they face an underlying paradox: despite the desire to speak up – and often encouragement from employers and colleagues alike to do so – it’s not as simple as coming forward to raise a concern or advocate for themselves. In many cases, they’re facing their older managers, who still expect younger workers to “pay their dues” before speaking their minds – and not step on their toes as higher-ranking employees.

How are younger workers supposed to reconcile this mismatch – and can they? Although they’re gaining footing in representation and subsequent power in numbers, many workplace norms still prevail while Gen X and Baby Boomers helm organisations. For Gen Z and millennials, advocating for themselves can be a tricky tightrope to walk.

‘A moral obligation to speak up’

In the past few years, work has changed in many ways – among them, the fact that young workers want a place at the table.

This is not a wholly new desire: 2011 research on millennial workers – who at that time were the lowest-ranking generation in the workplace – showed 90% believed leadership should listen to their ideas. Now, however, the issue is becoming even more pronounced as Gen Z graduates into the workforce. Experts say they’re following millennials’ lead with the desire to be heard – and, in some cases, expect to be able to speak about even more issues, including flexibility, pay and values.",https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20221206-can-younger-workers-speak-up-without-managers-bristling,2022-12-06T00:00:00
2,Inside Japan's most minimalist homes,"""The home – before it is a place of beauty – is a place for safety, and assessed according to its alignment with its natural surroundings,"" says Mihoko Iida, whose new book Japanese Interiors takes a look inside some of Japan's most interesting private homes. From urban apartments to mountain and seaside escapes, the spaces featured in the book all share this idea of what home interiors mean in Japan, and how they are informed by a sense of harmony and balance with their surrounding environment.

More like this:

- The world's 10 most ingenious buildings

- How to sleep well and be happy at home

- The vintage French style resonating now

Alongside the homes' proximity to nature is the pared-back simplicity for which Japanese design has become known. ""Minimalism has a long history in Japan,"" explains author Iida, ""rooted in the teachings of Zen Buddhism that came to our country via China, and found a foothold beginning around the 12th Century.""

In the book, Iida explains how these ideas aligned with Japan's existing religion, Shintoism, ""a nature religion that does not worship a central figure but rather considers all things – man-made and natural – to possess a spiritual essence."" Interpretations of this vary, she explains. ""A simplified explanation is that nothing should be treated poorly, and therefore it is better to have nothing. Or as Buddha said, 'The less you have, the less you have to worry about'."" Many modern minimalist homes in Japan are influenced by shrines and temples as a result. Here are some of the most beautiful and most intriguing.",https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20221206-japans-most-zen-like-minimalist-interiors,2022-12-06T00:00:00
3,What would a green World Cup look like?,"Food, for example, is a comparatively low source of carbon emissions for the World Cup compared to travel and instructures – Fifa's estimates for Qatar 2022 put emissions of food and drink together at less than 1% of total emissions. Still, serving vast amounts of meat – which is far more carbon intensive than vegan and vegetarian sources of protein – sends a wider message to people attending and watching the games.

""Food is just so easy and obvious: don't have animals in the food at the World Cup,"" says Vince, whose own football club went vegan in 2017. One substantial change many people can make personally is to reduce the quantity of animal products they consume, and our own dietary choices can influence the choices of those around us. ""And it's the same for any sporting event. It's the showcase, the symbolism, the example that's being set.""

Food options could also be labelled with their exact carbon footprint, Poole adds, so fans could make informed decisions about what they eat, much like we have calories on foods now. Some sports organisers, like Wimbledon, and food brands, like Quorn, are already starting to add this information to their food and menus, she adds. (Read more about whether we should count carbon like calories.)

Green ambassadors

But a green World Cup would have to go much further than changes to food alone: much greater consideration would be put into what is advertised on everything from footballers shirts to banners around the stadium and TV ads. For one thing, there would be a marked absence of products or brands associated with high carbon lifestyles, such as airlines and SUVs, says Seymour.

You might also like:

There is a huge dissonance between hearing a sports event is ""carbon neutral"" then attending and seeing airlines and fossil fuel companies advertised on jerseys, agrees Orr. ""That is sending a very different message to me about their values and where they're going and what they are trying to achieve, by who they're aligning themselves with, and what they're trying to sell me."" Seeing vegan protein, electric car and renewable energy companies advertising would create a very different picture, she says. Sport has done this before, she notes – cigarettes used to be widely advertised in sports including football, for example, but are now no longer promoted in many countries.

Beyond advertising, there is even precedent for Fifa banning countries from participation for political reasons. It could also implement serious penalties if host countries do not meet the expectations on sustainability, says Orr. All this could help ensure sustainability is embedded into the very bidding process from the start.

In fact it's hard to overestimate the impact of a World Cup that visibly embraced and promoted genuine and credible climate action. But individual sports celebrities also have a huge impact on wider culture. It's an engagement that has not always been welcomed by sports organisations, however – many were angered this year when Fifa sent a request to World Cup teams to ""focus on the football"" rather than discussing human rights issues in Qatar.",https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221206-what-would-a-green-world-cup-look-like,2022-12-06T00:00:00
4,What's the best way to parent adopted children?,"In 2018, my husband and I were one of the first married same-sex couples to adopt in Germany. Before we were approved, we had to complete a long process of interviews, financial and medical checks, as well as extensive preparation classes. In these classes, we were often confronted with the myriad challenges that many adoptive children face. Some of them are to do with a fundamental sense of separation and loss: what the Scottish writer and adoptee Jackie Kay, in her memoir, Red Dust Road, describes as the ""windy place right at the core of my heart"". Others are rooted in traumatic experiences that occurred before the adoption, which can include neglect and abuse, prenatal alcohol exposure, or spending early childhood in institutional care.

While individual experiences of adoption can vary hugely, these underlying traumas can pose long-term risks for the child. According to an analysis of 85 studies on the mental health of adoptees and non-adoptees, the risk of adoptees experiencing psychiatric disorders, having contact with mental health services, or treatment in a psychiatric hospital was approximately double that of non-adoptees. Similarly, a Swedish study on international adoptees found a higher risk of severe mental health problems and suicide in adolescence and young adulthood among children who had been adopted.

However, although being adopted is associated with these risks, a successful adoption placement can help vulnerable children overcome the early adversity they faced. Adoption has been shown to help close the developmental gap between children who have been in care and their peers, having a measurably positive impact on, for instance, their cognitive development.

For children who have faced abuse or neglect in their birth families, adoption and foster care can bring a range of long-term benefits that continue to have an effect well into adulthood – the most important arguably being an enduring sense of safety. But this journey can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances, notably the child's age at adoption. One study has shown that children adopted at a very young age were as securely attached to their permanent families as non-adopted children, while children adopted later tended to struggle more with attachment.

The question then, for an adoptive parent like me, is how best to help your child address these challenges. This seems basic enough. Something that science must have long since come up with some solid answers for. But when I talk to researchers about what has surprised them most about their work on parenting adopted children, their response is unanimous.",https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221124-what-really-helps-adopted-children-thrive,2022-11-24T00:00:00
5,Berlin's beloved (and loathed) local dialect,"It was the height of the Covid-19 pandemic when a message came through to my Berlin apartment building's WhatsApp group. It was a video from our neighbour, filming his feet – complete with black socks slipped into a pair of Adidas sandals – as he stomped on a couple of cardboard boxes.

""Cardboard box made small in five seconds,"" read the caption in German, passive-aggressively punctuated with a kissy face emoji. ""If I can do it, so can you.""

Berliners generally have a reputation for being cold, outspoken and blunt. This modus operandi is cheekily (or fearfully) called the Berliner Schnauze, literally the ""Berliner Snout"". It plays off a need for order, an assumption that everyone else is doing something wrong, followed by a brash correction of the behaviour.

Victims of the Berliner Schnauze are usually passersby, getting told off for something they didn't realise they were doing wrong. In our case, it was triggered by the recycling bins overflowing at the apartment building. Others have experienced it on the U-Bahn when they were too hasty getting on and someone barked, ""Erst raus dann rein!"" (""First out, then in!""). Whatever the case may be, the Berliner Schnauze strikes without warning, usually unprovoked, delivering a brutal level of honesty you never asked for.",https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20221205-berlins-beloved-and-loathed-local-dialect,2022-12-05T00:00:00
6,The workers lured into oversold jobs,"When May was recruited into a state-funded career-coaching role, she thought she would be able to achieve meaningful outcomes for clients. “The job suggested I would be able to coach people back into work,” says May, who is based in southwest England. “I've done a lot of coaching, and I thought my skills could really help people and make a difference to their lives.”

Yet the reality turned out to be quite different. Her day was divided up into 30-minute sessions and, of these, “the people I could help were maybe 10% of my workload”. The rest were candidates for whom a return to the workforce was unrealistic; instead of coaching, they required other support structures like healthcare or social services. “I just couldn't help them, and it was very soul destroying,” says May. Far from using her skills to create a positive impact, she felt her job was performative. “I was a tick-box exercise. I was just calling people to check what they were doing.”

Starting a new job always means taking a leap of faith – at best it’s an informed gamble – but sometimes roles can be oversold from the get-go. Recruiters and hiring managers might say a position comes with better working conditions, more responsibility or opportunities for progression that never materialise. They might make the role sound more meaningful or rewarding than is really the case. And new starters might only find out the reality of the job once they’ve already committed.

This is a more likely scenario in a tight labour market, where job openings are plentiful, and companies must compete to secure new hires. One 2022 survey of more than 2,500 workers from careers site The Muse showed that nearly three-quarters of respondents had started jobs, only to find that the position was very different to what they had been led to believe.

Workers in this position may well feel disappointed and demotivated – and want to leave. In the same survey, 80% of respondents said it was acceptable to leave a role that didn’t live up to expectations within six months. Yet this leaves candidates in an awkward position to explain in future interviews, and puts companies back to square one with a role to refill. Why, then, do companies oversell roles? And what can workers do to avoid landing a position that doesn’t live up to expectations?",https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20221202-the-workers-lured-into-oversold-jobs,2022-12-02T00:00:00
7,The Alpine villages producing their own power,"Globally, that imbalance between the number of small plants and their overall output is similar. Small plants represent an estimated 91% of all hydropower installations, but only make up 11% of hydropower output. And yet, they have seen a worldwide boom in recent years – as well as a growing body of evidence from around the world suggesting their impact is more profound than was previously thought.

""The biggest problem associated with small hydropower concerns their sheer numbers,"" says Thiago Couto, an aquatic ecologist and postdoctoral associate at the University of Miami. He has studied the effects of small hydropower plants around the world, including in countries such as Brazil. ""Today, for every large hydropower dam operating there are other 11 'small' ones, and their numbers are expected to continue rising into the future. The cumulative impact of all these small dams on hydrology, fish migration and water quality is an issue of high concern, especially in rivers that accommodate multiple dams.""

Small hydropower dams may for example play a disproportionate role in interrupting the natural flow of rivers, known as river fragmentation, research by Couto and others shows. This can prevent migratory fish from travelling. Environmental activists have described the impact of such an accumulation of small, disruptive plants on rivers as ""death by a thousand cuts"".

From an environmental perspective, ""small"" is not a particularly meaningful term, Couto notes, since it usually just refers to generation capacity – rather than to factors that actually matter for the plant's ecological impact, such as how much water is diverted, and how much remains in the stream bed. And while small hydropower is often marketed as a good solution for unconnected communities, globally, ""the proliferation of small hydropower is not being primarily propelled by rural electrification,"" he says, but rather, by incentives and subsidies that make it a lucrative investment for businesses.

Nor are remote communities necessarily in favour of small hydropower. Sámi reindeer herders in northern Norway have opposed small hydropower development in the past, out of concern over its impact on reindeer pastures.

Scientists have also pointed to the knowledge gap around small hydro, since they are only beginning to fully understand how different factors affect a plant's overall impact.

A team of scientists conducting a long-term ecological research project in the Matschertal valley (Val di Mazia), led by the Institute for Alpine Environment at the Eurac Research Center in South Tyrol, made a surprising discovery. Their project's main aim has been to study the impact of climate change on an Alpine river ecosystem. But a few years into the study, a small run-of-river diversion hydropower plant with a weir was added to the steep, glacier-fed, fast-flowing stream they were monitoring. They used the opportunity to make a before-and-after comparison of the plant's impact on benthic macroinvertebrates – small aquatic animals such as stonefly larvae that live in waterbodies, and are commonly used as indicators of their ecological condition. They expected the plant to have a significant impact on the macroinvertebrates – but those expectations were not confirmed.

Instead, the results of the five-year study showed ""no significant variation in the benthic macroinvertebrate communities stemming from the activity of the hydropower plant"". A second study looking specifically at the functional traits of the macroinvertebrates before and after the plant's installation – meaning, how they interacted with their environment and with other species – and did not find any significant differences, either.

""One really important point is that there are no fish in this particular part of the river,"" says Roberta Bottarin, a limnologist and the vice head of the Institute for Alpine Environment at Eurac, who co-authored the study. ""If there had been fish, we would probably have had very different results."" In her view, other factors, including the relatively large amount of water left in the original stream, may also have helped buffer the impact of the plant.

Still, she cautions against interpreting the results as a green light for small hydropower in the high mountains, emphasising that the team only measured the impact on the macroinvertebrates, not on the wider ecosystem. ""From an ecological point of view, these high mountain streams are very sensitive. And if you build a plant there, you risk disrupting that ecological continuity and disturbing the natural balance. It's really something you have to weigh very carefully.""",http://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221129-the-alpine-villages-producing-their-own-power,2022-11-29T00:00:00
8,Should we get rid of air miles for climate change?,"Rather than simply capping travellers' ability to fly, Carmichael suggested an alternative: to limit the perks that travellers get from airlines. Among his recommendations, Carmichael proposed an outright ban on air miles and frequent flyer loyalty programmes that he says incentivise ""excessive"" flying.

By one estimate, trips taken using air miles account for around 10% of overall bookings. But could axing these schemes curb rising aviation emissions? Or would such a policy be fruitless – and efforts to reduce aviation be better spent elsewhere? The answer is more complicated that it might initially seem.

You might also like:

Aviation loyalty programmes are around 40 years old. Texas International Airlines, a now-defunct carrier, created the first one in 1979. At the time, governments were easing restrictions over which carriers could fly, where they could fly to, and when, so competition between carriers intensified. Airline execs needed new ways to boost their brand. One solution? Offer flyers something extra to secure their loyalty – an IOU that could be cashed in later.

Paying passengers would earn ""miles"" based on how often and how far they flew, which could then be exchanged for a complementary trip. Although these programmes have since evolved (today's flyers are also rewarded based on how much they spend), the underlying premise remains the same.

Some climate activists suggest that it's time to scrap these schemes. ""The very last thing we should be doing is reward frequent flyers,"" says Herwig Schuster, a transport campaigner for Greenpeace. ""Frequent flyer programmes are not fair to the climate and the majority of people worldwide who almost never fly. We cannot allow airlines to incentivise a lifestyle that's destroying the planet while they receive major tax cuts and subsidies, and fill their pockets by selling more flight tickets.""",http://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221122-should-we-get-rid-of-air-miles-for-climate-change,2022-11-22T00:00:00
9,The floating solar panels that track the Sun,"On a lake in the Netherlands, a shiny circular island floats, covered in dozens of shimmering solar panels.

But this is no normal solar array, nor even simply one of the many new floating solar farms being installed in lakes, reservoirs and coastal areas across the world. That's because its panels are doing something none of these other floating solar farms can do: meticulously tracking and following the Sun as it moves across the sky, to catch as many rays as possible.

This glistening installation, named Proteus after the ancient Greek sea god, is among the first to combine floating solar panels with Sun-tracking technology – all in an effort to maximise the amount of clean electricity it can produce.

The island, floating in Oostvoornse Meer, a lake in the south-west Netherlands, is covered in 180 of these moving solar panels, with a total installed capacity of 73 kilowatt of peak power (kWp). It's a tiny amount in a world rapidly trying to switch to renewable energy, but SolarisFloat, the Portuguese company which built Proteus, believes this small installation could be scaled up to generate large amounts of clean electricity – and, crucially, without taking up valuable land.

Solar revolution

From the Brazilian Amazon to Japan, floating solar panels are experiencing a boom around the world. Floating solar capacity has grown hugely in the past decade, from 70 MWp in 2015 to 1,300MWp in 2020. The market for the technology is expected to grow by 43% a year over the next decade, reaching $24.5bn (£21.7bn) by 2031.

""Floating solar is a rather new [renewable energy] option, but it has huge potential globally,"" says Thomas Reindl, deputy chief executive of the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (Seris). Covering just 10% of all man-made reservoirs in the world with floating solar would result in an installed capacity of 20 Terawatts (TW) – 20 times more than the global solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity today, according to an analysis by Seris seen by BBC Future Planet.

The rise of floating solar technology is among the latest trends in the revolutionary expansion of solar PV electricity in recent years. Globally, solar PV capacity has increased almost 12-fold in the past decade, from 72GW in 2011 to 843GW in 2021. The technology now accounts for 3.6% of global electricity generation, up from 0.03% in 2006. At the same time, solar arrays have seen an astonishing price drop which has made them the world's cheapest source of power.

Further expanses in solar energy are expected – in fact, capacity needs to reach six times the current amount by 2030 to stay on track with a net zero emission world, according to the International Energy Agency. Global geopolitics are also playing a role in rising reliance on solar power: the European Union has proposed a massive ramping up of renewable energy as it aims to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas in the wake of the country's invasion of Ukraine.",http://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221116-the-floating-solar-panels-that-track-the-sun,2022-11-16T00:00:00

11,German police raids target far-right extremists ‘seeking to overthrow state’,"Twenty-five people including a 71-year-old German aristocrat, a retired military commander and former MP for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) have been detained in Germany on suspicion of a terrorist plan to overthrow the state and renegotiate the country’s post-second world war settlement.

Thousands of police carried out a series of raids across Germany on Wednesday morning in connection with the far-right ring.

Federal prosecutors said 3,000 officers conducted searches at 130 sites in 11 of Germany’s 16 states against the group, whose members it said adhered to a “conglomerate of conspiracy theories” including the QAnon cult and the so-called Reich Citizens movement.

Prosecutors said 22 German citizens were detained on suspicion of “membership in a terrorist organisation”. Three other detainees, including a female Russian citizen, were suspected of supporting the organisation, they said.

Der Spiegel reported that locations searched included the barracks of Germany’s special forces unit KSK, in the south-western town of Calw. The unit has in the past been scrutinised over alleged far-right involvement by some soldiers. Federal prosecutors declined to confirm or deny that the barracks was searched.

Along with detentions in Germany, prosecutors said one person was detained in the Austrian town of Kitzbühel and another in Perugia in Italy.

German media have identified as the group’s ringleaders Heinrich XIII, 71, a descendant of the noble Reuß family that used to rule over parts of eastern Germany in the 12th century, and a former senior field officer at the German army’s paratrooper battalion named only as Rüdiger von P.

Last year, the pair founded a “terrorist organisation with the goal of overturning the existing state order in Germany and replacing it with their own form of state, which was already in the course of being founded”, with Rüdiger von P in charge of planning the military coup and Heinrich XIII mapping out Germany’s future political order.

The group had even started to nominate ministers for a transitional post-coup government, reported the newspaper Die Zeit, in which one of the suspects, the former AfD MP Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, 58, was to be federal minister for justice.

The group was convinced modern Germany was run by a “deep state” conspiracy that was about to be exposed by an alliance of German intelligence agencies and the militaries of foreign states including Russia and the US.

“Everything will be turned upside down: the current public prosecutors and judges, as well as the heads of the health departments and their superiors will find themselves in the dock at Nuremberg 2.0”, one of the suspect said in a message posted on Telegram minutes before the start of Wednesday’s raids, Die Zeit reported.

While the suspects believed their aims could be achieved only by military means and with force, prosecutors said, it was unclear whether the group had managed to amass any serious kind of arsenal.

Several of the accused are former members of the military and are suspected of having illegally taken weapons out of the army’s stock during their years in service, while others hold arms licences.

After their takeover, the group had envisioned renegotiating the treaties Germany signed after the end of the second world war with the allies. “For now, the Russian Federation was exclusively to be the central contact for these negotiations,” prosecutors said.

While Heinrich XIII had made efforts to reach out to Moscow, prosecutors said “there is no indication that the contacts reacted positively to his approach”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/german-police-raids-target-far-right-reich-citizens-movement,2022-12-07T00:00:00
12,Key figures behind alleged far-right plot to overthrow the German government,"Heinrich XIII, Prince of Reuß

The 71-year-old aristocrat, who was arrested in Frankfurt’s West End district on Wednesday morning, has been described by prosecutors as the ringleader of the terror group plotting to overthrow the government. If their plan had succeeded, he had envisioned installing himself as the leader of a revolutionary government.

A descendant of the noble House of Reuß that ruled parts of Thuringia, in eastern Germany, for about 800 years, Heinrich in 2019 delivered a 16-minute speech at a digital business summit in Zurich infused with far-right conspiracy theories.

“After thousands of years of rule”, he complained, his dynasty had been “dispossessed” after the first world war, a conflict brought about by “foreign powers”. He claimed the dark driving forces behind the 20th century’s great wars were the Rothschild dynasty and Freemasons.

“Ever since Germany surrendered, it has never been sovereign again”, Heinrich said. “It has only been made an administrative structure of the allies”

In August this year, the current head of the House of Reuß-Greiz, Prince Heinrich XIV Reuß of Greiz, distanced himself in strong terms from his relative, describing him as a “confused old man” who left the family 14 years ago.

German media reported Heinrich XIII to have recently earned his living with property deals and the production of sparkling wine.

Rüdiger von Pescatore

The 69-year-old retired army officer has been described by prosecutors as the aspiring leader of the terror group’s “military arm”. Between 1993 and 1996, Von Pescatore was a commander at paratrooper battalion 251, which was later submerged into the Special Forces Command (KSK). He was reportedly expelled from the military over the unauthorised sale of weapons from the stocks of the old East German army.

In 2019, an internet user bearing Von Pescatore’s name made comments on a website that claims to expose secret Freemason plots behind major events in world history. “The truth will only become accessible to mankind after the system change,” wrote the commenter, who said he was writing from Brazil.

Birgit Malsack-Winkemann

In the post-coup “shadow cabinet” that the terrorist group had allegedly started to plan, the crucial justice ministry was to be reserved for Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, 58, whom police arrested at her apartment in Berlin’s Wannsee district on Wednesday morning.

Malsack-Winkemann has been a member of the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) since it was formed on an anti-euro ticket in 2013. As a member of the Bundestag between 2017 and 2021, the trained lawyer once claimed migrants were causing “billions in excess costs” to the German health system because they were unable to read instruction leaflets on their medication, a claim dismissed by pharmacists as lacking a basis in fact.

Other parliamentarians described Malsack-Winkemann as a supporter of conspiracy theories with a particular obsession with the QAnon cult, the newspaper Die Zeit reported. A holder of a gun licence, she is understood to own two firearms.

As recently as October, a disciplinary tribunal rejected a Left party plea to stop Malsack-Winkemann from returning to her former, supposedly impartial role as a judge at a Berlin district court. At the time, her spokesperson had insisted she was part of the “very moderate” wing of the AfD. ​​",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/key-figures-behind-alleged-far-right-plot-to-overthrow-german-government,2022-12-07T00:00:00
13,Rishi Sunak ‘absolutely shocked’ by Michelle Mone allegations,"Rishi Sunak has said he was “shocked” to read allegations about the Conservative peer Michelle Mone, as it emerged that her loss of the Tory whip in the Lords only came about because she voluntarily took leave of absence.

Citing information revealed by the Guardian, Keir Starmer asked Sunak at prime minister’s questions: “How did his colleague Baroness Mone end up with nearly £30m of taxpayers’ money in her bank account?”

Sunak replied: “Like everyone else, I was absolutely shocked to read about the allegations,” prompting jeers from the Labour benches.

He continued: “It’s absolutely right that she is no longer attending the House of Lords and therefore no longer has the Conservative whip. The one thing we know about the honourable gentlemen is that he is a lawyer – he should know there is a process in place. It is right that process concludes. I hope it is resolved promptly.”

On Tuesday, Mone’s spokesperson said she was taking leave of absence from the Lords with immediate effect, “in order to clear her name of the allegations that have been unjustly levelled against her”.

It is her taking a leave of absence that means she no longer holds the Tory whip, given that the party had declined to remove it while she was still in the Lords.

After PMQS, No 10 confirmed that neither Sunak nor the Conservative whips office had taken any action against Mone, and that she lost the whip by default.

“It was her voluntary decision” to step back from the Lords, Sunak’s press secretary said, dismissing as “hypothetical” questions about whether Mone would get the whip back if she returns.

At PMQs, Starmer pushed Sunak on Mone, saying: “Everyone can see what’s happening here. A Tory politician got their hands on hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ money, and then provided duff PPE. And he says he’s shocked? He was the chancellor. He signed cheques. How much is he going to get back?”

Sunak avoided the question, talking instead about rail strikes in response.

The Guardian revealed last month that bank records indicated Mone and her children secretly received £29m originating from the profits of a PPE business that was awarded large government contracts. In addition, a second company that she lobbied ministers over in an attempt to secure government Covid contracts was a secret entity of her husband’s family office, the Guardian also reported.

On Tuesday evening, Labour won a vote that would force the government to publish some documents underpinning the contracts.

It came as a donor who recently defected to Labour said the Conservative party’s response to the allegations about Mone had only strengthened his determination to help oust it from office.

14,No 10 says Michelle Mone has lost Conservative whip ‘by default’ – UK politics live,"From 45m ago 09.19 EST No 10 says Michelle Mone lost Tory whip 'by default' when she took leave of absence from Lords At the post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM’s press secretary said Lady Mone lost the Tory whip “by default” when she took a voluntary leave of absence from the Lords. The press secretary said: She’s taken a leave of absence therefore, by default, she has not got the Conservative whip any more. Asked why Rishi Sunak waited for Mone to in effect strip herself of the whip if he was “shocked” by allegations about her, the press secretary claimed that was matter for the whips’ office. When it was put to her that Sunak cut Mone adrift, the press secretary replied: “I wouldn’t characterise it as that. She’s taken a leave of absence from the House of Lords.” She said she was not aware of “any conversations” between Sunak and Mone about her taking a leave of absence, adding: “As I understand it, it was her voluntary decision.”

29m ago 09.35 EST Labour says bill requiring minimum rail services on strike days would be 'unworkable' At its own post-PMQs briefing, Labour said it thought legislation requiring unions to maintain minimum service levels during transport strikes would be “unworkable”. A spokesperson said the party would oppose any such legislation. But she would not commit the party to repealing it if it were passed. However, she did say some trade union legislation would be repealed. She said: We would repeal the 2016 Trade Union Act. There are unnecessary elements in trade union legislation that we would look at … One example would not allowing online balloting. We don’t think that’s practical, we think it’s costly and we think that’s unnecessary.



35m ago 09.29 EST Sunak says he is working on 'tough' new law to protect people from rail strike disruption At PMQs Rishi Sunak said he was working on “tough” laws to protect people from strikes. In a reference to the Tory proposal to legislate so that unions have to maintain minimum service levels during transport strikes (which was promised in the 2019 manifesto), he said: The government has been reasonable. It’s accepted the recommendations of an independent pay review body, giving pay rises in many cases higher than the private sector. But if the union leaders continue to be unreasonable, then it is my duty to take action to protect the lives and livelihoods of the British public. That’s why, since I became prime minister I have been working for new tough laws to protect people from this disruption. But at the post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson would not give further details of what the new legislation would say, or when it might be introduced. At the transport committee this morning Mark Harper, the transport secretary, said a bill of this kind was “not a solution” to the current dispute. (See 10.12am.)

53m ago 09.11 EST The Conservative party has confirmed Alex Wickham’s report that its membership fee is going up. (See 11.17am.) A party spokesperson said: An increase to the membership fee, which has been frozen for 16 years, has been agreed. Existing members will see their membership fee frozen in 2023 and the new membership fee remains substantially cheaper than Labour’s. The fee for new members will from £25 to £39. Most Labour members pay about £50 a year, PA Media says. The Tory MP Justin Tomlinson has criticised the increase. Absolutely stupid idea. If the Party needs to balance the books stop wasting £millions on polling / research telling us the blinding obvious.

After his toe-curling adventures in the reality TV jungle, it was assumed he had no route back to the top of politics. But the announcement may come as a surprise to anyone who made the mistake of believing Matt Hancock’s own spokesperson. Only last week, in response to a Sun story, the spokesperson told Sky News: Matt has no intention of standing down or stepping away from politics and there has been no conversation with Mayah Riaz or any other PR.

In a letter to Rishi Sunak that he has posted on Twitter, Hancock said that he was recently told that he would have the whip restored (it was removed because he went on I’m a Celebrity without permission), which would have allowed him to stand again at the next election. But he said he was quitting anyway, because he had realised he did not need to be in parliament “to influence the public debate”. He also implied the Conservative party was on a path to defeat, saying that it had to “reconnect with the public we serve” and that: The revival of modern conservatism over the next decade will I suspect take place as much outside parliament as much as in it.

2h ago 08.32 EST PMQs - snap verdict When William Hague became Tory leader, for a while he regularly trounced Tony Blair at PMQs by making MPs laugh at him. Hague can deliver jokes brilliantly, and Blair did not know how to respond. Eventually he hit back by saying, as often as he could, that while Hague was good at jokes, he could not do serious politics. As Hague himself admitted in a recent interview for Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart’s podcast, The Rest is Politics, he was spooked by the criticism and toned down the jokes a bit. In retrospect, that is a mistake. Keir Starmer, and the whole Labour machine, are trying to ensure that when the public see Rishi Sunak, they think “weak”. But Sunak, Blair-style, is trying to shame him off this line of attack. In his first response to Starmer he complained that the opposition leader was just “focused on the process and the politics”. In his second response, he said Starmer was “engaging in the petty personality politics, not focused on the substance”. It is a defensive ploy, and not altogether convincing (not least because Sunak himself accused Starmer of not being “strong” enough to stand up for workers affected by rail strikes), but it went some way to blunting the attacks he was receiving from the Labour leader. Sunak also had a good retort to Starmer’s questions about the housing targets U-turn, and why the government was allowing councils to have the final say over housebuilding targets. Just this week, on Monday, [Starmer] said the government should be giving people more power and control. Now he seems to be opposing that policy. It is a fair criticism of the policy announced by Starmer with Gordon Brown on Monday. Governments can champion decentralisation, or they can champion housebuilding, but it is hard for them to do both. In most of their PMQs encounters so far Starmer has won quite easily. Today it was more even, although he still had the upper hand. His mockery over the policy U-turns was effective. His jibe about the “blancmange prime minister” who “wobbled” was good (at least, for those of us old enough to remember the pink pudding monstrosity). And Starmer can do withering scorn as well as anyone now, as showed with this line. Does [Sunak] really expect us to believe that the member for Chipping Barnet [Theresa Villiers] and the member for the Isle of Wight [Bob Seely] are cheering him on because he’s going to build more homes? Pull the other one. Starmer also scored a direct hit with his Michelle Mone question. Although Sunak said in response that he was “absolutely shocked” by the revelations, it was a response that didn’t explain why she was allowed to retain the Tory whip. The question was more powerful than the answer – although Kevin Brennan’s version of the same question was even better. (See 12.32pm.) At PMQs the PM normally saves his best soundbites for his final answer. But Starmer scuppered that today but devoting his final question to strep A. In the past, when the opposition leader has wanted to raise a question on something sombre and cross-party, they’ve almost always done it at the start. Saving the grim topic of an illness that has led to the deaths of children to the end meant Sunak was obliged to ditch whatever party-political crowdpleasers he had in his file, and instead address the question. It was a novel and surprise tactic, and it helped give Starmer the edge. But it was also the sort of move you deploy when you don’t want to take your opponent for granted.

2h ago 07.39 EST Poll suggests support for independence in Scotland has reached 56%, with 44% opposed Severin Carrell Support for independence has jumped sharply after the UK supreme court ruled last month that Holyrood was unable to hold a fresh referendum without Westminster consent, according to a new poll from Ipsos. Their poll for the broadcaster STV found support for independence was now 56%, up six points from its poll in May, versus 44% against. The Scottish National party said that showed the yes vote was “rocketing” after the court’s judgment, which has now barred Nicola Sturgeon from pursuing a legal referendum. NEW from @IpsosScotland and @STVNews

✴️ SNP strengthens General Election support to 51%

✴️ No indication that a 'de facto' referendum strategy would harm the party’s electoral chances

✴️ 56% would vote Yes and 44% No in an immediate #indyref2 - Yes up 6 points since May (1/9) pic.twitter.com/dCMtlKupGz — Emily Gray (@EmilyIpsosScot) December 7, 2022 Ipsos said those figures were based on responses from those “very likely” to vote and also knew how they would vote. Other polling organisations use a different method, and do not normally produce results based only on likely voters. Ipsos also found SNP support was at 51%, up by seven points since May, and the Scottish Greens at 3%. Other recent polls have shown a fall in support for the SNP, to as low as 41%. If the Ipsos results were matched at a general election, it could vindicate Nicola Sturgeon’s plans to use the next general election as a “de facto referendum”. She says winning a majority of Scottish votes would mandate her to start negotiations on independence – a position Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak have rejected. Emily Gray, the managing director of Ipsos in Scotland, said: This is a high-risk strategy for the party, who secured 45% of the vote in 2019. However, the indication from this poll is that, at this stage at least, this is not harming their electoral chances. At the same time, there are some indications that wider public ratings of the SNP have slipped. While the SNP remains comparatively more trusted than other parties, trust in their ability to manage a range of crucial issues – including the NHS and the economy – has fallen significantly over the last 18 months.

3h ago 07.32 EST Kevin Brennan (Lab) says we all applauded nurses during Covid. But at the same time “Tory spivs” were helping themselves to public money. Why is the PM on the side of the spivs not the nurses? Sunak said the government needed to get PPE quickly.

Labour should stop playing politics with this, he says.

15,‘They want to kill us’: mayor Vitali Klitschko plans for the worst as Russia tries to freeze Kyiv,"In his office in Kyiv’s city hall, mayor Vitali Klitschko is planning for the worst and hoping for the best.

The previous day, in the middle of the sixth mass Russian missile strike against Ukrainian cities that had sent Kyiv’s resident to the bomb shelters and metro stations, no rockets had made it through to hit the capital.

On the mayor’s desk is a newspaper he has had produced and distributed around the city in recent days. Bearing his name, and the headline “We will overcome and win”, it lists all the emergency services in Kyiv that will be available in case of what should be unthinkable but isn’t: the failure of all power and services to a city of 3 million in the depths of Ukraine’s winter.

Across three densely printed pages are supermarkets with generators that will work in that emergency, the post offices and banks, and arrangements for public transit.

It lists the 45 underground metro stations that will remain open as shelters and provide phone charging and internet, as well as tips for surviving a prolonged blackout.

“It’s for the worst-case scenario,” says Klitschko, a former world champion boxer turned politician, picking up the paper. “We need to tell people what they need to do if the situation becomes critical and they don’t have internet and connection to media.”

Life in the city can often seem largely normal outside of the massive airstrikes that have been taking place, often weekly, since 20 October. Restaurants are busy and the streets are jammed with traffic at close to prewar levels, but with the first snow on the ground and the temperature hitting -8C this week, life in the capital is also overshadowed by the risk of a humanitarian crisis.

“Thanks to our military, they knocked out all the missiles fired at Kyiv yesterday,” says Klitschko. “But it was only two weeks ago we came close to a total blackout. Then the temperature was above freezing but imagine the same situation if it happened now when it is close to -10 outside and with no electricity water, or heating. The consequences would be disastrous.

“In that attack almost the whole city was without electricity. For the next 12 hours we were working night and day to bring back the power,” he adds.

Ukrainians have coined a word of what Russian is attempting, Kholodomor – mass death by freezing – a play on Holodomor, the portmanteau word used to describe Joseph Stalin’s human-made famine in Ukraine that killed millions in the early 1930s.

“We never expected that they would try to destroy the civilian infrastructure of our cities. It is genocidal. It’s terrorism,” says the mayor. “They want to freeze the civilian population. They want to kill us, want to have a Ukraine without Ukrainians.”

For Klitschko, efforts to keep the city going have become a blur. “To be honest, it’s one long, long day. Sometimes I’m confused what day of the week it is. I sleep in a different place every night and I don’t know what the challenge will be tomorrow. But I’m still alive and it’s not everyone who has the privilege to be healthy.”

If the Kremilin’s effort to freeze Ukraine’s population into capitulating is failing, it is not only because of the country’s rapidly improving air defences but also the enormous efforts to repair power plants as soon as they are damaged.

Even now, however, power remains patchy in some parts of Kyiv, with energy conservation measures still in force and many businesses outside of the central parts of the city relying on mobile generators.

And while many residents of Kyiv were cheered that no missiles or so-called kamikaze drones landed on the city – although they struck elsewhere in Ukraine – Klitschko is not ready to believe the aerial threat is gone – even with the arrival of new air defence systems from western allies.

Asked whether those air defences are taking pressure off the city, he says: “Yesterday there were 70 missiles and almost every one was shot down. But just today I was talking to our military partners and I asked them same the question you are asking me.

“There’s no clear answer. We can’t tell if our air defences are in perfect condition right now. I can say the situation is better than two weeks ago and much better than two months ago. But we still need help with more, and more modern air defence weapons, to save lives.’

The interconnectedness of Ukraine’s national grid system and the reliance on pumped hot water produced in central plants for heating most homes means Kyiv is vulnerable to attacks elsewhere in the country.

While much has been made of efforts by Ukraine’s allies to send large mobile generating units to help protect critical civilian infrastructure, Klitschko does not see it as the answer.

“It’s good that we are seeing big generators being sent but it’s still not a panacea for all challenges we are facing. Just a single one of the water pumping stations in Kyiv requires 4 megawatts to operate. On top of that they require huge amounts of fuel. That’s why those generators are at hospitals and schools, and main sites that are really critical that people really need. Because even with the new generating capacity it’s not enough. It won’t bridge the deficit we’re facing.”

For Klitschko, as for other Ukrainian officials, there is only one real answer – the defeat of Russia on the battlefield and the end of the conflict.

“I’m not Nostradamus so I’m not ready to give an answer about the timing of when this war will end but I know that we will win. I’ll tell you why. It’s a rule of war that people will die in battle. But what’s most important is the motivation for fighting.

“There has been no real explanation to Russian soldiers of why they fight. So they are fighting for money. We are ready to die for our family and children. All of us. We are fighting for our children’s future, for democracy and human rights. Because we don’t want to live in a country that is a jail that is built by Putin. It’s why our soldiers would rather die than bend the knee.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/kyiv-mayor-plans-for-the-worst-russia-freeze-city-vitali-klitschko-power,2022-12-07T00:00:00
16,Warnock’s Senate win over Walker in Georgia runoff another blow for Trump – live,"Blake Masters , Senate candidate in Arizona, lost to sitting Democrat Mark Kelly . Democrat Katie Hobbs also won the governor’s race, ending a streak of Republican governors that dates back to 2009, but for her opponent Kari Lake , the race isn’t over: she’s refused to concede .

Here are a few of the most high-profile of his failed candidates. Call it a hall of shame:

But with Democrat Raphael Warnock victorious in Georgia’s run-off election for Senate – the last major outstanding race – it’s now clear that voters even in traditionally Republican areas were not interested in what Trump’s people were selling.

Donald Trump was an extensive endorser in the 2022 midterm elections, typically of candidates who hewed at least partially to his baseless conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen from him.

The former president is never shy about sharing his thoughts, and around midnight on the east coast last night – after it became clear Herschel Walker was going to lose in Georgia – he posted these words on his Truth social network : “OUR COUNTRY IS IN BIG TROUBLE. WHAT A MESS!”

His candidate lost in Georgia, and he had to hire people to search his own property for classified documents. It may only be Wednesday, but you can say that it’s already been a rough week for Donald Trump .

Donald Trump hired an outside firm to search two of his properties for classified material and make sure that he had complied with a court order to turn over all such documents he possessed, the Washington Post reports.

Citing anonymous sources, the Post reports the searches took place at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf course and at Trump Tower in New York, the most recent property the investigators visited. The former president is being investigated for allegedly unlawfully retaining classified documents he took with him after he left the White House, and the searches were conducted to ensure he complied with a May grand jury subpoena to turn over all documents bearings classification markings.

Here’s more from the Post:",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/dec/07/georgia-senate-race-results-warnock-walker-trump-politics-live-updates,2022-12-07T00:00:00
17,Herschel Walker’s son revels in father’s Georgia Senate runoff defeat,"Among the many detractors celebrating Herschel Walker’s defeat in the Georgia Senate runoff was one closer to home: son Christian, who expressed his delight on Twitter that the state had rejected his controversial father.

“Don’t beat women, hold guns to peoples [sic] heads, fund abortions then pretend your [sic] pro-life, stalk cheerleaders, leave your multiple minor children alone to chase more fame, lie, lie, lie, say stupid crap, and make a fool of your family,” the younger Walker said in the first of a flurry of tweets posted on Tuesday night as the Democrat Raphael Warnock was projected to be the winner.

“And then maybe you can win a Senate seat.”

It can never be known how much damage the younger Walker’s social media posts during the campaign, castigating his father for abandoning his wife and children, running off with other women and paying for girlfriends’ abortions, did to his father’s hopes of reaching Washington DC.

But an early happy family reunion would seem unlikely in the wake of Christian’s latest barrage of messages and insults.

“Don’t compare Warnock running over his wife’s foot to my father holding guns and knives to my mothers [sic] throat, threatening to kill his therapist, her, and one of his adultresses in a therapy session, and telling my mom and I he was going to beat our asses,” he wrote in a forthright statement.

In a follow-up post, he paid tribute to his mother and Herschel Walker’s ex-wife Cindy Grossman, who recalled how in 2008 her husband allegedly held a gun to her temple and said: “I’m going to blow your effing brains out.”

“This is my amazing mom who’s had her name and image dragged through the media unwillingly… Shoutout to every strong mother whose story goes untold. We love you,” he wrote.

Observers, however, will note that Christian was not always so antagonistic. In a December 2021 post to his 282,000 followers, the podcast host and self-declared “free speech radicalist” announced how “honored” he was to introduce his father at his patron Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, proudly calling him a “future senator”.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/07/herschel-walker-son-christian-celebrates-defeat-georgia,2022-12-07T00:00:00
18,China to allow home quarantine as Covid restrictions eased nationwide,"China’s government has said people with Covid-19 who have mild or no symptoms can quarantine at home, in a significant shift towards living with the virus.

The 10-point directive, issued on Wednesday afternoon by China’s national health commission, also instructed officials to stop launching temporary lockdowns, and ended testing and health code requirements for “cross-regional migrants”, suggesting much freer travel across China for the lunar new year period.

The new rules are the strongest sign that China’s ruling Communist party has abandoned its long-running zero-Covid policy.

Previously, sick people and their contacts, ranging from immediate family members to distant neighbours, were forced into massive purpose-built centralised quarantine facilities, while areas ranging from residential buildings to entire cities could be locked down for days, weeks, or months.

While some cities and regions have eased restrictions at a local level in recent days, Wednesday’s changes appear to create a national consistent response to the management of patients and contacts.

“Asymptomatic persons and mild cases can be isolated at home while strengthening health monitoring, and they can transfer to designated hospitals for treatment in a timely manner if their condition worsens,” the NHC statement said.

The order said local officials must stop arbitrarily expanding quarantine areas, and “more scientifically and accurately” designate “risk zones”. Anywhere designated high-risk must be opened up after five days of no cases, it said.

Mass testing has also been wound back, with a focus on people working or living in high-risk settings. Negative PCR results and health codes are now only required for nursing homes, welfare homes, medical institutions, childcare institutions, and primary and secondary schools. Schools without outbreaks must operate as normal.

Other directives include a renewed focus on vaccinations of elderly people – who have sought out immunisation at much lower rates than younger demographics – ensuring the availability of medication and rapid tests, and enhancing protections of vulnerable groups.

Since the pandemic began, China had managed Covid-19 under the protocols set for dangerous diseases like the bubonic plague and cholera. The resource intensive and hyper-strict policy of outbreak containment and elimination, brought huge economic and social consequences.

Officials are emphasising the reduced severity of Omicron, which has been in China for about a year, and government messaging has shifted from elimination of the virus to mitigating its effects.

Early online reaction to the changes appeared positive, particularly over the hopeful end of inconsistent outbreak management.

“The key is that the local and grassroots levels can carry out the policy, not this ‘you do yours, I do mine’ mentality,” said one Weibo commenter. “Epidemic prevention is not about sacrificing the existence of normal life.”

“Three full years, the end, is also a new beginning,” said another.

One Guiyang resident, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Guardian he was looking forward to being able to travel. “I want to do a very long trip,” he said.

“I feel nothing about lifting the lockdown, I may still be numb … what I hated the most these [past] years is that there were a lot of restrictions/lockdowns that had no reason. We do not trust anything from the government now.”

The change comes a week after widespread protests against the zero-Covid policy. Demonstrators called for an end to restrictions, with anger also directed at the authoritarian government and its leader, Xi Jinping.

The government – which has largely avoided publicly acknowledging the protests – insists the changes are related to other factors. At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, health officials pushed back on questions about the timing of the changes, given they had only recently implemented a 20-point policy overhaul. Officials insisted it was an “active choice”, based on continual reassessment of policies and the less severe features of the current variant.

Public frustrations had escalated after a building fire in Urumqi killed 10 people, with a local lockdown blamed. It followed a bus crash which killed 27 people being taken to quarantine, and widespread concerns about “secondary deaths” linked to zero-Covid enforcement, like suicides and denial of emergency healthcare.

Wednesday’s announcement also appeared to answer some of that anger.

“It is strictly forbidden to block fire exits, unit doors, and community doors in various ways to ensure that the public’s access to medical treatment, emergency escape, etc. is unobstructed,” it said.

China is now likely to face a widespread outbreak of infections. With far fewer tests being conducted, the official numbers of daily cases have dropped, but anecdotally infections and fevers appear to be spreading.

Health experts have warned that China’s population could have a sharp rise in infections and deaths in the subsequent wave, similar in rate to that of other countries after they abandoned zero-Covid policies. Its situation is further complicated by inequitably distributed health are, low vaccination rates among the elderly, a refusal to provide more effective foreign made vaccines, and almost no existing natural immunity to the virus.

Many of these concerns were acknowledged by the officials on Wednesday, but one noted that other countries had “paid a high price” to reach their levels of natural immunity, and praised China’s system for protecting millions of lives.

19,Matt Hancock says he will not stand for Conservatives at next election,"Matt Hancock has announced he will not stand again as a Conservative MP, saying he wants to instead seek “new ways to communicate with people of all ages and from all backgrounds”.

The West Suffolk MP, who had lost the Tory whip and faced considerable anger in his local party after appearing on ITV’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here, wrote to Rishi Sunak to announce the decision, tweeting the letter.

Hancock said he had spoken to the chief whip, Simon Hart, last week, and he had “made clear he would restore the whip in due course, but that is now not necessary”.

The Conservatives “must now reconnect with the public we serve”, he wrote, saying this must mean finding new ways to do so.

My letter to the Prime Minister 👇



I look forward to exploring new ways to communicate with people of all ages and from all backgrounds pic.twitter.com/PPvWB6McyM — Matt Hancock (@MattHancock) December 7, 2022

The decision marks an apparent change of heart for Hancock. A spokesperson for the MP told Sky News last week: “Matt has no intention of standing down or stepping away from politics.”

Hancock’s letter appeared to set out something of a political epiphany he had undergone while in the Australian jungle for the ITV show, in which he defied expectations that viewers would quickly vote him out and finished third.

“The Conservative party must now reconnect with the public we serve,” he wrote. “There was a time when I thought the only way to influence public debate was in parliament, but I have realised there’s far more to it than that.

“I have increasingly come to believe that for a healthy democracy we must find new ways to reach people – especially those who are disengaged with politics. The revival of modern conservatism over the next decade will, I suspect, take place as much outside parliament as in it.

“For my part I want to do things differently. I have discovered a whole new world of possibilities which I am excited to explore – new ways for me to communicate with people of all ages and from all backgrounds.

20,"Northern Ireland can create abortion clinic buffer zones, supreme court rules","The Northern Ireland assembly can legislate to create buffer zones around abortion clinics to protect users and staff, the UK’s highest court has ruled.

The supreme court’s unanimous judgment means the assembly can proceed with the abortion services (safe access zones) (Northern Ireland) bill, which criminalises people who enter the specified areas and influence people attending clinics.

The attorney general for Northern Ireland argued that clause 5(2) of the bill was a disproportionate interference with the freedom of conscience, speech and assembly of anti-abortion protesters and demonstrators, protected under articles 9, 10 and 11 respectively of the European convention on human rights (ECHR), and so outside the assembly’s legislative competence.

However, Wednesday’s written judgment by Lord Reed said the restrictions were in pursuit of a legitimate aim – promoting public health – and compatible with the ECHR rights of anti-abortion protesters.

“The right of women in Northern Ireland to access abortion services has now been established in law through the processes of democracy,” he said. “That legal right should not be obstructed or impaired by the accommodation of claims by opponents of the legislation based, some might think ironically, on the liberal values protected by the convention.

“A legal system which enabled those who had lost the political debate to undermine the legislation permitting abortion, by relying on freedom of conscience, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, would in practice align the law with the values of the opponents of reform and deprive women of the protection of rights which have been legislatively enacted.”

Under clause 5 (2), it is an offence to do anything, intentionally or recklessly, in a safe access zone that has the effect of influencing a person attending an abortion clinic or other protected premises for protected purposes. The attorney general had argued that because there was no defence for those who act with reasonable excuse, it was disproportionate. But the argument was rejected by the court.

Reed wrote: “A measure that seeks to ensure that women seeking a safe termination of pregnancy have unimpeded access to clinics where such treatment is provided, and are not driven to less safe procedures by shaming behaviour, intrusions upon their privacy, or other means of undermining their autonomy, is a rational response to a serious public health issue.”

The judgment was welcomed by abortion rights campaigners, including in Scotland where the parliament had been awaiting the decision before proceeding with its own plans for buffer zones. The MSP Gillian Mackay, who proposed the Scottish bill, said it could now “progress at pace”.

Alyson Kilpatrick, the chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which intervened in the case, said the bill should receive royal assent as a matter of urgency, calling the judgment “a positive affirmation of women and girls rights to protection from harassment when accessing these services”.

The other intervener, Justice, welcomed the protection for women accessing abortion services but expressed concern that the judgment could have significant implications for protest rights in other contexts, “from climate change to racial inequality”. It had wanted the justices to find that courts are always required to undertake a proportionality exercise when deciding whether to convict in circumstances where articles 9, 10 and/or 11 are engaged, but they declined to do so.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/07/northern-ireland-abortion-clinic-buffer-zones-supreme-court-ruling,2022-12-07T00:00:00
21,City faces fresh post-Brexit blow as EU moves to restrict certain trades,"The City of London faces another post-Brexit blow to its dominance after the EU moved to require firms to settle more financial-risk reducing trades within the bloc.

The plan centres on trades in securities known as derivatives, and on financial market clearing houses, the intermediaries that enable the transfer of funds to sellers and financial products to buyers. Handling trillions of transactions each year, they are deemed an essential part of financial market plumbing that reduces risk.

Since Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, the subject has become a battleground, as Brussels seeks to end what it sees as an over-reliance of European firms on London for euro-denominated derivatives trades.

At the end of 2020, the London Stock Exchange’s LCH clearing house handled more than 90% of interest-rate derivatives, denominated in euros. These interest-rate swaps are widely used by firms to protect themselves against unexpected changes in borrowing costs.

Under draft proposals issued by the European Commission on Wednesday, financial firms will be required to clear a yet-to-be determined proportion of “systemic” derivatives via active accounts in EU clearing houses. The minimum requirement will be set by the EU regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority, one year after the law is adopted.

An EU official said the legislation meant it was “less likely” that the commission would extend a temporary deal that allows London’s clearing houses to continue serving customers in the bloc. An “equivalence” decision granting permission to Britain’s clearing houses to carry on the pre-Brexit trade expires on 30 June 2025, one of several temporary fixes agreed after Britain’s EU exit.

The official stressed that decision would be taken by the political leadership of the next commission, which takes office in 2024.

Despite repeated Brussels pleas to reduce dependence on the UK, European banks and financial firms continue to use London’s clearing houses. In a report published last December, the EU regulator ESMA concluded that three UK clearing houses were of “substantial systemic importance” to the EU and could pose financial stability risks.

One EU official said the commission didn’t have “a specific problem” with UK regulations, but the bloc was over-reliant on external providers. “What recent experience has told us, with the pandemic and the effects of the war [in Ukraine], is that supply chains, no matter how robust they may seem from the outside … are vulnerable.”

The official added: “This is not to say we don’t trust people [or that] we don’t trust [British] regulation. It is simply to say that if something goes wrong we will be vulnerable.”

The plans form part of the EU’s efforts to forge a “capital markets union”, an attempt to make Europe’s fragmented financial centres more attractive to international investors. The commission also wants to harmonise corporate insolvency rules and make it easier for small companies to get stock market listings.

European banks have warned that the clearing plans could backfire, saying they could shift business to the United States.

The proposals must now be agreed by EU finance ministers and the European parliament before becoming law.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/07/city-faces-fresh-post-brexit-blow-as-eu-moves-to-restrict-certain-trades,2022-12-07T00:00:00
22,Kent family charged £80k in error after EDF sent £1m electricity bill,"A family of four were told they owed nearly £1m to EDF for a year’s electricity and had £80,000 taken by direct debit, despite telling the company it was clearly incorrect.

The payment, which put Richard Baron and his family more than £75,000 over their overdraft limit, was refunded by their bank’s fraud team before any serious damage was done. However, after cancelling their direct debit, they were put on a higher tariff with the energy provider.

“It was quite amusing to begin with, until it actually happened,” said Baron, who lives in Deal, Kent, with his wife and two young children.

He had received an email stating his direct debit payments were going up to £80,124 a month, totalling £961,488 for the year.

“I assumed it was just an error because obviously it’s nothing, by any means, to do with our usage,” he said.

The family’s electric bill usually came to about £150 a month and they were already in credit by £1,000 because EDF had been taking bigger payments than the family’s usage, despite them having a smart meter.

Baron called EDF and was passed to three different departments before a staff member identified what had gone wrong.

“She said it looked to just be a problem with their system and they would rectify it,” he said.

However, a few days later Baron’s EDF app still showed there was an £80,000 payment due so he called again and was assured it would be fixed. It wasn’t.

“My wife got a text message about seven o’clock in the morning saying we had insufficient funds in our household account, but it didn’t say how much it was. I just assumed we’d strayed by about a hundred quid into an overdraft because it was towards the end of the month, when all the direct debits and the mortgage go out.

“But when I looked it was minus £76,000.”

Baron contacted the fraud department of his bank, Lloyds, which was able to refund the money within hours of the payment being taken, meaning none of the family’s other direct debits bounced.

“But the thing that annoyed me was that I checked my bank account at the beginning of this month just to make sure everything was all lined up, and I saw EDF was proposing to take another £80,000 out of my account on Christmas Day,” said Baron.

He cancelled his direct debit, which was against the terms of the contract, causing the family to lose their fixed-term deal. They were charged £100 a month more than they were previously and did not receive an apology from the company.

When contacted by the Guardian, EDF apologised to the Barons and said the family’s direct debit had been reinstated at the previous level and that a full review would be conducted to ensure the payment error would not happen again.

“We’ve been in touch with Mr Baron to apologise and agreed for EDF to apply a gesture of goodwill to his account and have reinstated the direct debit at his requested level.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/07/kent-family-charged-80k-in-error-after-edf-sent-1m-electricity-bill,2022-12-07T00:00:00
23,‘Amazing occurrence’: hurricane erosion reveals shipwreck on Florida beach,"Severe beach erosion from two late-season hurricanes has helped uncover what appears to be a wooden ship dating from the 1800s which had been buried under the sand on Florida’s east coast for up to two centuries, impervious to cars that drove daily on the beach or sand castles built by generations of tourists.

Beachgoers and lifeguards discovered the wooden structure, between 80ft and 100ft (24-31 meters), poking out of the sand over Thanksgiving weekend in front of homes which collapsed into rubble on Daytona Beach Shores last month from Hurricane Nicole.

“Whenever you find a shipwreck on the beach it’s really an amazing occurrence. There’s this mystery, you know. It’s not there one day, and it’s there the next day, so it really captivates the imagination,” said maritime archaeologist Chuck Meide, who on Tuesday led an archeological team from St Augustine, Florida, to examine the beach find.

Hurricane Ian made landfall in late September on Florida’s south-west coast and exited into the Atlantic Ocean over central Florida. Nicole devastated much of Volusia county’s coastline in early November, leaving behind homes collapsed into the ocean after they had been made vulnerable to erosion from Ian.

“It’s a rare experience, but it’s not unique, and it seems with climate change and more intense hurricane seasons, it’s happening more frequently,” Meide said of the discovery.

Meide, who serves as the director of the research arm of St Augustine Lighthouse & Museum in Florida, said he was convinced the structure is a shipwreck because of how it was constructed and the materials such as iron bolts that were used.

After the initial discovery two weeks ago, sand from waves reburied the ship’s timbers that had become visible on Daytona Beach Shores. Members of the archeological team this week do not intend to uncover the entire length of the ship, but merely enough to measure it, draw it and possibly take some wood samples to test for its origins.

There are no plans to remove the ship from Daytona Beach Shores, not only because the cost would probably run in the millions of dollars, but because it is protected where it is, packed into the wet sand, Meide said.

“We will let Mother Nature bury the wreck,” he said. “That will help preserve it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/07/florida-shipwreck-beach-uncovered-hurricanes,2022-12-07T00:00:00
24,Man charged with public order offence after egg allegedly thrown at king,"A man has been charged with a public order offence after an egg was allegedly thrown at the king during a walkabout.

Bedfordshire police refused to disclose the name of the suspect after the incident outside Luton town hall on Tuesday.

The force said in a statement: “A 28-year-old man has been charged in relation to an incident which occurred during His Majesty King Charles III’s visit to Luton yesterday.

“The man was charged under section five of the Public Order Act and has been bailed to appear at Luton magistrates court on 9 January 2023.”

The monarch’s security staff temporarily steered him away from the crowds shortly after arriving in the town.

He then continued to shake hands with members of the public after being moved to a different area.

The incident comes weeks after Patrick Thelwell, 23, was arrested for throwing an egg at the King and Queen Consort during their visit to York.

The conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”, the Nato chief said at an event hosted by the Financial Times, after weeks of speculation over the potential for diplomatic talks. He said: The conditions [for talks] are not there now because Russia has shown no sign of engaging in negotiations which are respecting the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. It is for Ukrainians to decide when the time is right to start to negotiate and to agree the conditions. Most wars and most likely also this war will end at the negotiating table. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter because, he warned, Russia was seeking a “break” in the fighting to prepare for a spring offensive. He said: What we see now is that Russia is attempting to try to freeze this war, at least for a short period of time, so they can regroup, repair and recover, and try to launch a bigger offensive next spring. Ukraine had “momentum”, he continued, adding that he “cannot go into the specific systems that we are now considering”. He said: The paradox is that the more we want a peaceful, negotiated solution, ensuring that Ukraine prevails, the more urgent it is that we provide military support to Ukraine.

13m ago 09.51 EST Vladimir Putin has said there is no need for an additional call-up of Russian reservists to fight in Ukraine at the moment, Reuters reported. Putin said that of the more than 300,000 Russian reservists who were drafted in what Moscow called a “partial mobilisation” in September and October, 150,000 were deployed in the zone of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. Of those, 77,000 were in combat units and the remainder were performing defensive functions, he said.

1h ago 08.48 EST Peter Beaumont In his office in Kyiv city hall, the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, is planning for the worst and hoping for the best, Peter Beaumont writes. The previous day, in the middle of the sixth mass Russian missile strike against Ukrainian cities that had sent Kyiv’s resident to the bomb shelters and metro stations, no rockets had made it through to hit the capital. On the mayor’s desk is a newspaper he has had produced and distributed around the city in recent days. Bearing his name, and the headline “We will overcome and win”, it lists all the emergency services in Kyiv that will be available in case of what should be unthinkable but isn’t: the failure of all power and services to a city of 3 million in the depths of Ukraine’s winter. Vitali Klitschko: ‘They want to freeze the civilian population. They want … to have a Ukraine without Ukrainians.’ Photograph: Thomas Peter/Reuters Across three densely printed pages are details of supermarkets with generators that will work in that emergency, the post offices and banks, and arrangements for public transit. It lists the 45 underground metro stations that will remain open as shelters and provide phone charging and internet, as well as tips for surviving a prolonged blackout. “It’s for the worst-case scenario,” says Klitschko, a former world champion boxer turned politician, picking up the paper. We need to tell people what they need to do if the situation becomes critical and they don’t have internet and connection to media. Life in the city can often seem largely normal, outside of the massive airstrikes that have been taking place, often weekly, since 20 October. Restaurants are busy and the streets are jammed with traffic at close to prewar levels, but with the first snow on the ground and the temperature hitting -8C this week, life in the capital is also overshadowed by the risk of a humanitarian crisis. “Thanks to our military, they knocked out all the missiles fired at Kyiv yesterday,” says Klitschko. But it was only two weeks ago we came close to a total blackout. Then the temperature was above freezing, but imagine the same situation if it happened now when it is close to -10 outside and with no electricity water, or heating. The consequences would be disastrous. Read the full story here: ‘They want to kill us’: mayor Vitali Klitschko plans for the worst as Russia tries to freeze Kyiv Read more

2h ago 08.30 EST UN: Russian forces killed at least 441 civilians, including children, in first weeks of Ukraine war At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented summary executions and attacks in dozens of towns across three regions, and warned the actual number of victims in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions was likely to be much higher. The report covered the beginning of Moscow’s invasion on 24 February until early April, and gathered evidence from 102 towns and villages in Ukraine. It said: The acts in question were committed by Russian armed forces in control of these areas and led to the deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls). Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report said. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a “special military operation”. In a statement, the UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said: There are strong indications that the summary executions documented in the report constitute the war crime of wilful killing. Overall in the war through 4 December, the OHCHR said it had counted 6,702 civilian deaths, and that its monitoring includes violations by all parties.

2h ago 07.40 EST Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, including its embassy in Madrid, which also received a letter bomb. In a statement on his Facebook page, Kuleba wrote: In the last two days, suspicious packages have arrived at embassies in Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Denmark, as well as consulates in Gdansk. In total, we already have 31 cases in 15 countries: Austria (1), Vatican (1), Denmark (1), Spain (5), Italy (4), Kazakhstan (1), Netherlands (1), Poland (6), Portugal (2), Romania (2), USA (1), Hungary (2), France (1), Croatia (1), Czech Republic (2). Ukrainian embassies and consulates had been functioning “in the mode of enhanced security measures” as the “threats to our diplomats keep coming”, he said. According to Kuleba, all envelopes “noted the same address of the sender: Tesla dealership in the German town of Sindelfingen”. He said the packages came from post offices that were not equipped with video surveillance systems. He said the packages came from attackers who took measures not to leave traces of their DNA, adding this “indicates the professional level of embodiment of this action”. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured last Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. In an interview with CNN last week, Kuleba described what followed the Madrid attack as “more weird” and “even sick”. He said after Wednesday packages started arriving at various Ukrainian diplomatic missions soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. He said: In one case it’s most probably an eye of a cow, and an eye of a pig in another case. Asked who he thought was behind the packages, Kuleba said he “feels tempted to name Russia” as it benefited from sowing fear among Ukrainian diplomats. But he added that it could also be someone who sympathises with Russia, so he would await the findings of ongoing investigations.

The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. They were cited by Tass as saying: On the Shakhtersk-Torez highway, a truck carrying military personnel collided with a minibus. Sixteen people died, three victims were hospitalised. The truck driver was among the dead, the news agency reported, adding that the cause of the accident had not yet been established.

4h ago 06.00 EST Summary The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s news so far: The U S said it had not “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long-range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: “We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia.”

Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state BelTA news agency reported on Wednesday. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s security council as saying.

The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year.

Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional governor, said on Telegram that Russia launched drone and missile strikes on two villages overnight, injuring a 15-year-old girl and two other people. The Guardian has not been able to verify the reports independently.

Ukraine’s culture minister has called on western allies to boycott Russian culture, urging a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war. Writing in the Guardian, Oleksandr Tkachenko argues that such a “cultural boycott” would not amount to “cancelling Tchaikovsky”, but would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited troops close to frontlines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Addressing service personnel later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas, theatre of the heaviest battles, and in Kharkiv region, where Ukrainians have retaken swaths of territory from Russian forces.

Poland is preparing to deploy the German Patriot air defence system on its territory, after Berlin refused to place the system in Ukraine, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Twitter. Germany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland.

Europe is likely to scrape through this winter without cutting off gas customers despite reduced Russian supplies, but even adjusting to colder homes and paying more may not be enough in coming years, analysts have told AFP. Russia’s progressive reduction of gas supplies to Europe via pipeline triggered a bidding war for liquefied natural gas (LNG), sending prices sharply higher.

Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova.

Dmytro Zhyvytsky, the governor of Sumy region on the Russian border, said several people were wounded when Russian forces fired 226 shells on seven communities during the day.

The Kremlin said Vladimir Putin met senior officials on Tuesday to discuss “domestic security”, and Russia was taking “necessary” measures to fend off more Ukrainian attacks. One of the attacks struck the key Engels airfield in the Saratov region, where Russia keeps some of its strategic nuclear bombers. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the moment. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine.

5h ago 05.02 EST Charlotte Higgins Ukraine’s culture minister has called on western allies to boycott Russian culture, urging a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war. Writing in the Guardian, Oleksandr Tkachenko argues that such a “cultural boycott” would not amount to “cancelling Tchaikovsky”, but would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. He argues that such a step is right given that the war is “a civilisational battle over culture and history” in which Russia is actively “trying to destroy our culture and memory” by insisting that the two states constitute a single nation. Many cultural figures in Ukraine have said the Russian state is actively instrumentalising its artistic heritage during the conflict. Billboards in Russian-occupied Kherson, for example, showed images of Pushkin, with text referring to the Russian poet’s link with the city.

6h ago 04.20 EST The US said it had not “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. “We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia,” the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told reporters. 01:25 US has not 'encouraged nor enabled' Ukraine to strike inside Russia, says Blinken – video

26,"Iran has not sent ballistic missiles to Russia so far, says Ukrainian official","Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said.

Mykhailo Podolyak also told the Guardian that Russian forces had run short of their first batch of Iranian drones – and only had enough of their own cruise missiles in their stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukraine.

Russia has sought to replenish its arsenal with an offer to buy Iranian missiles. The secretary of the security council, Nikolai Patrushev, visited Tehran in November, and was reported to have had missiles on his shopping list.

But Podolyak said the deal has not gone through yet. “Iran has come under huge diplomatic pressure and the protests have also raised pressure on the government,” he told the Guardian in his Kyiv office.

“The government is starting to lose its grip on Iranian society and their inner domestic problems are growing. That’s why they just don’t have time for dealing with Russia. It’s not their priority.”

In a separate briefing, western officials largely concurred with Poldoyak’s remarks, emphasising that Russia has used up its stockpile of Iranian-made drones over a two-month period, mostly in waves of attacks directed against Ukraine’s energy grid.

One western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday that Russia had “run out” of Iranian drones about two to three weeks ago and was “anticipating a resupply” while the missile talks continued.

Iran initially supplied up to 2,400 of its drones, according to Ukraine, which were used in deadly attacks on cities such as Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia. Their stocks were “almost exhausted”, Podolyak added – but that “as far as we know” Iran had transferred the technology to Russia, so it was up to Moscow to make some more.

Western governments also believe that Iran has not made a decision on whether to supply Russia with missiles, reflecting in part how far Tehran wants to be drawn into the Ukraine war and its long-term relationship with Moscow.

“Iran will want to think carefully about what it’s committing, but there’ll also be a deeper conversation about what arrangement the Iranians and the Russians are coming to,” the official added.

Podolyak said he believed talks were still under way between Moscow and Tehran on missiles and that, as part of its bargaining position, the Russian government had offered its own “cut-throats”, referring to experts in crushing dissent, to suppress the nationwide anti-government protests. “So the negotiations are ongoing, but as of today, no missiles have been transferred to Russia,” he said.

An oil storage tank at a Russian airfield in Kursk was set on fire by a drone attack on Tuesday, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory.

Kursk airfield explosion Kursk airfield explosion

Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. At daybreak a large column of black smoke was still visible above the site.

Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised” – in an attack that came after Monday’s strikes on the Dyagilevo airbase in Ryazan and Engels-2 base near Saratov.

Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but is widely considered to have carried them out. Russian sources have said that Ukraine used a modified Tu-141 Strizh reconnaissance drone, originally built by the Soviets in the 1970s, on bases 300 and 500 miles from the border.

However, initial satellite images from Dyagilevo, released by Israeli satellite imaging company ImageSat International, showed only relatively limited damage from burn marks and objects near a Russian Tu-22M aircraft. Other experts have suggested the bases were attacked by drone from within Russia by partisan groups operating deep behind the frontline.

Western officials said there had been “an explicit bar” on some Nato-standard munitions being used within Russia, following reports that US Himars rocket artillery had been modified to prevent use of the ATACMS long-range rockets. They hinted that raids within Russia would probably have been conducted by Ukrainian-made and commercially acquired drones.

The presidential aide said that Ukrainian forces had become adept at defending against Russian missile attacks, claiming to have shot down an estimated 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday, as he argued Moscow may not be able to keep up the intensity of the nationwide barrage for much longer.

Western intelligence has endorsed previous estimates made by Ukraine in October that Russia has used up 70% of its precision missiles. However, multiple attacks that have damaged or destroyed half of the electricity network since then have raised questions about the true level of weapons stocks.

Earlier this week, experts from Conflict Armament Research concluded, after examining fragments of Russian Kh-101 cruise missiles fired at in Kyiv in late November, that one came from a missile manufactured in the summer and another in September.

The western official said on Tuesday that, when it came to precision guided missiles, it was believed that “the Russian military industrial complex can only produce so many at a time” and the approach to fire off a few dozen in a burst reflected the limits of the country’s productive capacity.

Podolyak said Ukraine, with foreign help, was also working towards making its power grid more resilient, redesigning it to make it easier for one region with access to power to help another that had been cut off. Monday’s air raids caused a series of power cuts, although the country’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said on Tuesday that the power deficit would be largely restored by the end of the day.

Podolyak, a close aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was also fiercely critical of remarks from Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, in which the French president suggested that the west should offer “guarantees to Russia” if Vladimir Putin agreed to peace negotiations.

“It’s quite weird when you’re not trying to help the victim – and it’s very clear who’s the victim here – but you’re thinking of how to satisfy the murderer,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/mikhailo-podolyak-iran-has-not-sent-ballistic-missiles-to-russia-so-far-says-ukrainian-official,2022-12-06T00:00:00
27,Ukraine calls on western allies to boycott Russian culture,"Ukraine’s culture minister has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture, urging a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war.

Writing in the Guardian, Oleksandr Tkachenko argues that such a “cultural boycott” would not amount to “cancelling Tchaikovsky”, but would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”.

He argues that such a step is right given that the war is “a civilisational battle over culture and history” in which Russia is actively “trying to destroy our culture and memory” by insisting that the two states constitute a single nation.

Many cultural figures in Ukraine have said the Russian state is actively instrumentalising its artistic heritage during the conflict. Billboards in Russian-occupied Kherson, for example, showed images of Pushkin, with text referring to the Russian poet’s link with the city.

Tkachenko – a former TV executive who has been criticised in Ukraine for failing to step in to halt a controversial threatened reorganisation of the Dovzhenko Centre, Kyiv’s film centre and archive – also urged arts institutions not to soften in their resolve not to hire Russian artists who support the war.

Ukrainian cultural figures are using the language of decolonisation to describe a process of separating themselves from a once-dominant Russian culture, one that was promoted while Ukrainian artistic expression was suppressed, sometimes violently, by the Russian empire and later the Soviet Union.

Such events included the mass killing in 1937 of a generation of Ukrainian artists and writers, known as the “executed renaissance”. No Russian music is being performed in Ukraine at present.

However, as the Christmas season approaches, with Nutcrackers the winter fare for ballet companies from New York to London, cultural leaders in the UK are stopping short of boycotting works from the Russian canon.

“The presentation of great historic works such as The Nutcracker, performed by an international roster of dancers, should send a powerful statement that Tchaikovsky – himself of Ukrainian heritage – and his works speak to all humanity, in direct and powerful opposition to the narrow and nationalistic view of culture peddled by the Kremlin,” said a spokesperson for London’s Royal Ballet.

He added that the company’s policy, for the duration of the war, continued to be that “we do not work with Russian state actors, such as the Bolshoi, nor individuals who have a clear association with the Putin regime in the Kremlin”.

A spokesperson for English National Ballet, which is also staging a production of Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker this Christmas, said that while the company “stands in solidarity with all those affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine”, its programme would go ahead as planned.

Kathryn McDowell, the chief executive of the London Symphony Orchestra – which is performing programmes including Stravinsky and Rachmaninov in Germany under Sir Simon Rattle – said: “We continue to perform Russian music of the past.” She also noted that the orchestra continued to work with Russian artists “who are not identifying with the current leadership”.

“While we at the Hallé abhor Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and are not performing music or working with artists who support this illegal war we as Ukraine’s allies stand against the Russian state, not its people or its culture,” said David Butcher, the chief executive of Manchester’s Hallé Orchestra, whose upcoming programmes include works by Stravinsky and Shostakovich.

“I don’t think it’s appropriate as a pioneering creative organisation to cancel, pause or self-censor, in our case, great music which deserves to be performed and heard.”

A spokesperson for the BBC pointed to its programming of Ukrainian music and culture on Radio 3 and elsewhere, including a summer Prom featuring the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra.

“We continue to carefully look at programming linked to Russia, considering everything on a case by case basis,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/ukraine-calls-on-western-allies-to-boycott-russian-culture,2022-12-07T00:00:00
28,Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 287 of the invasion,"The United States said Tuesday it hadn’t “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia. As Russian president Vladimir Putin convened his security council in the wake of the apparent drone strikes, Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia. “We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia,” secretary of state Antony Blinken told reporters.

The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter.

A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border.

Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova.

The Kremlin said Putin met senior officials Tuesday to discuss “domestic security” and said that Russia was taking “necessary” measures to fend off more Ukrainian attacks. One of the attacks struck the key Engels airfield in the Saratov region, where Russia keeps some of its strategic nuclear bombers.

The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by Blinken about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”.

Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said.

Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts.

Russia launched strikes on the Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said.

Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv.

Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan.

A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday.

A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-287-of-the-invasion,2022-12-07T00:00:00
29,My trip to space made me realise we have only one Earth – it must live long and prosper | William Shatner,"Last year, at the age of 90, I had a life-changing experience. I went to space, after decades of playing a science-fiction character who was exploring the universe and building connections with many diverse life forms and cultures. I thought I would experience a similar feeling: a feeling of deep connection with the immensity around us, a deep call for endless exploration. A call to indeed boldly go where no one had gone before.

I was absolutely wrong. As I explained in my latest book, what I felt was totally different. I knew that many before me had experienced a greater sense of care while contemplating our planet from above, because they were struck by the apparent fragility of this suspended blue marble. I felt that too. But the strongest feeling, dominating everything else by far, was the deepest grief that I had ever experienced.

While I was looking away from Earth, and turned towards the rest of the universe, I didn’t feel connection; I didn’t feel attraction. What I understood, in the clearest possible way, was that we were living on a tiny oasis of life, surrounded by an immensity of death. I didn’t see infinite possibilities of worlds to explore, of adventures to have, or living creatures to connect with. I saw the deepest darkness I could have ever imagined, contrasting starkly with the welcoming warmth of our nurturing home planet.

I worry about the world my grandchildren will be living in when they are my age

This was an immensely powerful awakening for me. It filled me with sadness. I realised that we had spent decades, if not centuries, being obsessed with looking away, with looking outside. I played my part in popularising the idea that space was the final frontier. But I had to get to space to understand that Earth is, and will remain, our only home. And that we have been ravaging it, relentlessly, making it uninhabitable.

I was born in Montreal in 1931. During my lifetime, this world has changed faster than for any generation before us. We are now at an ecological tipping point. Without the bold leadership that the times require, we are facing further climate breakdown and ecosystems collapsing before our eyes, with as many as one million species at risk of extinction, according to the latest scientific assessments.

And of all places, it is in the city where I was born that a crucial meeting of the United Nations is being held. At Cop15, the UN biodiversity summit in Montreal, taking place from 7 to 19 December, world governments will negotiate a global deal to stop the loss of biodiversity by the end of the decade. We need world leaders to give their diplomats a powerful mandate for these talks: agree on strong targets to change the way we produce food, to drastically cut pollution, and to conserve 50% of our planet’s land and ocean, with the active leadership of Indigenous peoples and local communities, who have historically been pioneers on all these necessary actions.

I was the oldest man to go to space. I worry about the world my grandchildren will be living in when they are my age. My generation is leaving them a planet that might pretty soon be barely livable for many of Earth’s inhabitants. My experience in space filled me with sadness, but also with a strong resolve. I don’t want my grandchildren to simply survive. I want them, as an old friend used to say, to be able to live long and prosper.

I will do everything I can so that we can protect our one and only home. Our world leaders have an immense responsibility to do the same in Montreal.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/07/william-shatner-earth-must-live-long-and-prosper-aoe,2022-12-07T00:00:00
30,"Ricky Gervais: Armageddon review – smug, macho, playground bants","Ricky Gervais gives us a little lecture after curtain call tonight about taking offence. Laughter is always good; no one’s getting hurt – that kind of thing. But, not for the first time, it’s a specious argument, setting up various straw men to represent those of us who might demur from his boorish comedy. I’m not suggesting his jokes about “dwarves”, “disabled creatures” and all the age-old targets of abuse will lead directly to hate crimes. I am suggesting they’re operating to a comic standard more associated with the playground than the standup stage.

It’s all a bit sad. Gervais is a clever chap, and a compassionate one, towards animals at least. But he’s convinced himself that anti-woke is a rebellious pose to strike – then convinced himself again that juvenile bants represents the best way to stage that rebellion. And so for punchlines we get African babies with Aids, sweatshop children whose mums get raped, and Gervais’s fictional limbless son being called “you little fucking grub”. If we don’t laugh, we’re “fragile” and “scared of words” – which Gervais paints here as a betrayal of millennia of “survival of the fittest” human evolution.

Cue the ostensible point of Armageddon: to imagine how it all might end for our “one species of narcissistic ape”. Gervais considers that prospect with equanimity: no lover of humanity he. But the theme is secondary to his battery of crude gags about immigrants, homelessness and, ho hum, Chinese people eating dogs. Throw in a few gags about his penis size from the 61-year-old, and the descent from the salad days of The Office is near-complete.

The shame is that there’s ample room in comedy to tease at woke over-earnestness and the contradictions of modern political correctness. With his jokes about the overuse of the word “fascist”, say, or a devious one about so-called cultural appropriation, Gervais shows how good he could be if Armageddon’s spirit were curious and engaged rather than macho and smug. He promises, tongue firmly in cheek, to find a justification for the worst jokes here before taping for Netflix. Might I suggest simply writing better ones?",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/dec/07/ricky-gervais-armageddon-review-manchester-apollo,2022-12-07T00:00:00
31,John Lennon and Yoko Ono simulate making love – Allan Tannenbaum’s best photograph,"I first met John Lennon in 1975, backstage at a televised event in New York when I was staff photographer for the SoHo Weekly News. Years later, while I was still at the paper, we decided to run an interview with Yoko Ono ahead of the release of the couple’s new album, Double Fantasy. They had spent the previous five years as recluses, during which time they had their son, Sean. I didn’t know Yoko personally but I’d always had a lot of respect for her as an artist, and of course I was a big fan of John’s. The idea was that we’d get access to the pair of them by approaching Yoko first.

On 20 November 1980, Yoko came to my Tribeca studio for the shoot. She was shy in front of the camera but eventually grew more comfortable, taking off her shades and leather jacket, finally striking a cute pose with her hand on her jeans zipper. We agreed to take more shots the next day at the apartment building where she and John lived, the Dakota. I had breakfast nearby and walked around, trying to find the right moment to ask Yoko whether we could take photos with John and Sean as well. “Not Sean,” she said. “But I’ll call John.” He was friendly and said he remembered me from the event in 1975, although maybe he was only being polite. The three of us walked around their favourite area of Central Park, later named Strawberry Fields in John’s memory.

'These are great,' John said. 'You know what I like about your photographs? They really capture Yoko’s beauty'

Five days later, I got a call asking me to join them at the shoot of the Starting Over music video. After filming them walking around the park, we went to another of their favourite spots, Cafe La Fortuna on West 71st Street, to drink coffee and talk. Then we set off for SoHo’s Sperone Westwater gallery in their limo. It was clear I had earned their trust and they felt comfortable with me. The gallery had been set up to look like their real bedroom, with lights outside shining through venetian blinds. For the first part of the filming they wore their normal clothes, but then took them off and simulated making love. Many of the crew were asked to leave but I remained, taking photographs discreetly. Their interaction was fluid and natural, their love for each other palpable.

This shot, with John lying on top of Yoko, was taken after a moment of tension. John kept trying to kiss Yoko, but she’d move her chin higher and higher. “What is this … Ben fucking Hur?” he joked and it broke the ice. Everybody on set cracked up, especially Yoko. That’s when I got this shot of them laughing. Back at the Dakota a few days later, looking through the contact sheets, John said: “These are great! You know what I like about your photographs? They really capture Yoko’s beauty.”

On 8 December, the day of John’s assassination, my editor called. He told me John had been shot. I was in shock. That night, after photographing at the hospital and police station, I stood outside the Dakota until the early morning, with hundreds of others who joined the vigil. A few days later, Yoko asked me to come to the apartment. When I arrived, she was in bed. Her grief filled the room. She told me she wanted to keep busy. It was her only way to cope.

We worked together on a project for the single Walking on Thin Ice. It was the last song she and John had written together: John had been holding the final mix when he was killed. I photographed a frozen reservoir in upstate New York, though it wasn’t used as the record jacket as intended, but instead as a still photo in the video clip. I remained in contact with Yoko for many years, attending her birthday parties and working on projects together. She kindly wrote the foreword of my book, John & Yoko: A New York Love Story. The last time I saw her was maybe four years ago.

I became a photographer because I’ve always liked technology and art; photography merges the two disciplines. My training had been in fine art and film-making, so I essentially taught myself photography in the 60s with a 35mm camera. My curiosity for people and interest in journalism also drove me. The job at SoHo Weekly News, which I got in 1973 at the age of 28, was my big break. It gave me access to New York’s music scene: the concerts and backstage life, as well as the nightlife at Studio 54. I’ve met and photographed nearly everyone from that scene: the Clash, Nico, Andy Warhol, Patti Smith, Debbie Harry, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and David Bowie. The thrill of being part of that is what keeps me going today.

32,"‘Silly, soggy’ or ‘screamingly good’? First responses to Avatar: The Way of Water emerge","The first responses to Avatar: The Way of Water have emerged online after the film’s world premiere in London on Tuesday. Full reviews of James Cameron’s long-in-the-making sequel to his own record-box-office fantasy epic won’t be published until next Tuesday, as per the distributor’s embargo, but critics are posting short responses on social media.

In the US, reactions have been largely positive. David Ehrlich, chief critic of Indiewire, said it was “light years better than the first & easily one of the best theatrical experiences in ages. streaming found dead in a ditch”. He added: “I was, uh, not exactly champing at the bit for an Avatar 2 … now I can’t *wait* to see Avatar 3. that’s basically all I wanted out of this and it delivered in a big way.”

The Atlantic’s David Sims said: “Avatar: The Way of Water absolutely owns bones,” adding: “It’s an Avatar movie: slow start, big build, incredibly involving second act with a ton of world building and cool creatures that blisses you way out, then an hour of screamingly good crystal clear emotionally trenchant action to send you home full and happy.”

People magazine’s Kara Warner, a self-confessed “Avatar stan” wrote: “I had high hopes … and for me it totally delivers. Sure it’s a little long, but worth it for the gorgeous visuals, wonderful new characters. A total thrill.”

The positivity was backed up by Cameron’s fellow film-maker Guillermo del Toro, who wrote on social media: “I say it again: Avatar 2 – seeing it you realize how long it has been since you saw a MOVIE-MOVIE (like that, in caps).”

However, reaction in the UK has been less uncritical. The Guardian’s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw has led the charge, saying “Avatar: The Way Of Water is a silly, soggy, motion-smoothed epic of solemnity without a single interesting visual image”, while the Daily Telegraph’s Robbie Collin posted a cryptic “grimace” emoji.

Christina Newland, lead critic of the i newspaper, was also less than impressed, writing: “Avatar: The Way of Water is a film to be admired more than loved – some remarkable spectacle, some throwback to Titanic set pieces, some really lovely visual flourishes. But it’s also interminably, ploddingly overlong, and more impressive than truly absorbing.”

Empire magazine’s Amon Warmann was a little more generous, but still equivocal, writing: “Liked it, didn’t love it. The good news is that 3D is good again (yay!), and the action is pretty incredible (especially in the final act). But many of the storylines feel like they have to stop and start, and the high frame rate was hit & miss for me.” He added: “This movie sure is pretty to look at though. And on the whole, I like #TheWayOfWater more than #Avatar 2009, if for nothing else because it has less in your face white saviourism than the original.”

33,‘Their vision needs to be shared’: the tiny shop championing the literature of the Amazon,"A small kiosk sits humbly next to Manaus Opera House, in the heart of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. Tucked below some trees, the shop is easy to walk past without noticing. But through its green glass doors lies the world’s largest collection of Amazonian literature: a treasure chest of forgotten cultures and ignored histories.

“It was always my dream to have a bookstore,” says Joaquim Melo, the 64-year-old owner of the Banca do Largo bookshop. “I’ve spent my life searching for these treasures.”

The Amazon is known for many things: its biodiversity, its Indigenous cultures, its forest’s power and precariousness. It is not generally known for its literary scene. Yet the region is home to many novelists, poets and short story writers who for decades have been using literature as a vehicle to promote and protect their cultures. These literary traditions, however, remain largely unknown within the region and abroad. As a result, people learn about the Amazon through the eyes of foreign explorers and anthropologists rather than from their compatriots.

After reading a book by a writer from the Amazon, I thought: ‘Where is all the Amazonian literature?’

Melo is trying to change this. Across the course of his life, he has curated a collection of more than 3,000 books. Banca do Largo serves as a refuge for Amazonian writers and activists alike, pushing to protect the region from exploitation.​ By promoting local literature, particularly works by Indigenous writers, Melo believes he can help spread new ideas about societal organisation and the environment that are different from the capitalistic frameworks prevalent in the west.

“These writers don’t see accumulation as a necessity,” he says. “They preserve the environment, they respect the rivers and the mountains, and they are anticapitalist.” He believes that “their vision needs to be shared”.

From a young age, Melo was an avid reader – his father would frequently bring books home. “Even though he couldn’t read, he made sure I did.”

When he was 11, Melo’s family moved from Brazil’s north-east to Manaus, where Melo picked up Imperador do Acre, a book by the Manaus writer Márcio Souza. Melo devoured the novel, reading it many times over. “Even today, I still think it’s one of my favourites.” It was the first time he had read an Amazonian writer, which made him wonder: “Where is all the Amazonian literature?”

Melo began seeking out more Amazonian books and by the time he went to study at the Federal University of Amazonas in 1999, his collection had grown considerably: other students came to him when they couldn’t find books in the university’s library.

In 2006, Melo decided to buy a magazine stand next to the opera house, where, alongside magazines, he displayed books from his personal collection. “I got a lot of positive responses,” he says, noting that students, artists, academics and professors would visit. “So I kept bringing in more books.” By 2010, the shop stopped selling magazines and specialised exclusively in Amazonian literature.

Over the past 12 years, Melo’s bookshop has become a key feature of Manaus society. “This is the centre for Amazonian culture and literature,” says Eunuquis Aguiar Muniz, a comic book writer. “There’s no other place like it.”

The books I sell show what the Amazon actually is

When you walk into Banca do Largo, you can tell the shop is the result of years of careful reading and deep studying about the region’s past and present. The books on the shelves range from poetry collections celebrating the jungle’s forest and fauna to novels chronicling the experiences of Lebanese-Brazilian migrants.

“I don’t even know if there is just one Amazonian literature,” Melo says. “So I include everything, from the European explorers to the new texts by Indigenous writers.”

The first written text about the Amazon is believed to be a 1542 book which chronicles the day-to-day life of Spanish explorer Capitán Francisco de Orellana as he travelled through the Napo region in search of gold. A 1942 edition of the book is on display in Melo’s shop, but he is quick to mention that many explorers dismissed the way of life of Indigenous people. “As a result, the origins of Amazonian literature history as we know it are quite complicated from a cultural and political perspective.”

By the 19th century, Amazonian writers started emerging. In 1852, Lourenço da Silva Amazonas published Simá, a book that seeks to give value to the Amazon region and its inhabitants, placing it as a founding element of Brazil’s identity.

But the region’s literature really flourished in the 20th century, when writers such as novelist Milton Hatoum and poet Thiago de Mello began publishing. “Mello denounced the exploration of Indigenous land and the military dictatorship,” Melo says. “He engaged with the principles of democracy.”

And in 1980, an Indigenous myth was published in written form for the first time. The book, Antes O Mundo Não Existia written by Umusi Pãrõkumu and Tõrãmu Kehíri, was groundbreaking. After its publication, a nine-volume collection followed that sought to promote myths descended from the Indigenous tradition of oral storytelling.

Since then, a new generation of Indigenous authors have emerged. Writers including Ely Macuxi, Daniel Munruku and Ailton Krerak have changed the face of Amazonian literature, offering new perspectives on the region and on the value systems that govern Brazil.

“The books I sell here show what the Amazon actually is,” Melo says as he hands me a book by Macuxi. “But it’s hard to find Amazonian literature outside the Amazon.”

Melo thinks this is largely due to the priorities of Brazil’s publishing industry, which favours authors from big cities such as Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo. But a lot of it has to do with consumers themselves, who Melo says are more interested in bestsellers and self-help books.

“Of course, there is a part of the Brazilian population that is interested in knowing ancestral and Indigenous knowledge,” he says.But the rise of the far right and fake news in Brazil means that people increasingly have prejudices about the Amazon and its inhabitants, Melo believes, ranging from racism towards Indigenous people to underestimating the seriousness of deforestation.

“I’ve been here for 18 years and I’ve been doing what I can to promote Amazonian culture,” he says. Melo has watched as books have shaped not only his worldview, but those of his customers. Literature has the power to change how people understand the Amazon, he believes. “We just need to let these books speak for themselves.”",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/07/amazonian-bookseller-literature-banca-do-largo-interview,2022-12-07T00:00:00

35,The 50 best albums of 2022 – 50 to 31,"50

Phoenix – Alpha Zulu

People are fond of criticising Phoenix frontman Thomas Mars for writing cryptic or nonsensical lyrics. I say: listen a little deeper, won’t you? Alpha Zulu, Phoenix’s seventh album, interrogates middle-aged ennui with razor-sharp wit, imbuing intoxicatingly sensory synthpop songs with deeply sad lyrics about the tensions between work and love. It ends with Identical, a tribute to the band’s late longtime producer Philippe Zdar, which also happens to be one of the band’s all-timer anthems – a eulogy to close out the biggest festival stage in the world. SD

Tove Lo – Dirt Femme

Striking … Tove Lo. Photograph: Moni Haworth

The Swedish pop star’s fifth – and first independent – album works as a decent primer for anyone who hasn’t been paying attention to the past few years in pop. It’s got Dua-style disco (thanks in part to sharing a collaborator in SG Lewis), Charli XCX’s death drive and one of those now-ubiquitous, infuriatingly catchy Y2K pop interpolations in 2 Die 4, which, quite bafflingly, samples Crazy Frog’s 2005 cover of Gershon Kingsley’s 1969 song Popcorn. Consequently Tove Lo is less of an eye-popping presence here than on her previous records, though her apparent recalcitrance makes her unusual anxiety and conflict around relationships and intensity all the more striking. LS

Kojey Radical – Reasons to Smile

Kojey Radical’s debut album finally arrived this year and, while a lot of long-gestating debuts can fall flat on arrival, Reasons to Smile was worth the wait. Its interplay of hip-hop grit and neo-soul smoothness is kinetic and hypnotic, like watching oil and vinegar try to emulsify. Radical himself is the glue between Reasons to Smile’s warring sides, a grinning, gloriously charismatic guide through his universe. SD

Earl Sweatshirt – Sick!

During a season of loss and introversion, an artist who made his name considering those states of being surprised listeners by expanding his purview, reaching outwards to forge connection – it’s there too in the warmth of the vintage soul-tinged production – and define some sense of freedom on his terms. It’s a beautiful example of Earl’s proclivity to defy expectations: on Sick!, the new father watches older members of his family die and reassesses his place in their lineage, past and future; he grapples with pain, how to process it rather than let it “fester into hate”, and works to stay present, aware of how “life can change in the blink of an eye”. LS

46

Danger Mouse and Black Thought – Cheat Codes

Danger Mouse, the defining producer of the 2000s, and Roots MC Black Thought have been working together for years, but their long-mooted full-length collab didn’t properly materialise until this summer. The result is soulful and whip-smart, and makes good on the promise of their first outing together, the 2005 Dangerdoom track Mad Nice: Cheat Codes contains granite-solid bars, luxuriant and sample-heavy beats in one of the most perfect producer/MC pairings of the past 20 years. SD

Special Interest – Endure

After six years on the DIY circuit, 2022 saw the New Orleans punk outfit head towards the mainstream. Compared with their back catalogue of distorted guitars and industrial synthesis, Endure was notably more pop-aligned, with buoyant keys and groovy riffs wrestling against lead singer Alli Logout’s grizzled vocals and a chugging drum machine. It was a change that felt like a liberating step forward, learning to embrace the more playful side of punk, rather than a sellout move. SB

44

Julia Jacklin – Pre Pleasure

Julia Jacklin’s first two records are rooted in relentless, cathartic self-interrogation. But Pre Pleasure is about picking yourself up, stepping over the strange entrails of truth you unearthed, and trying to remember who you are without the baggage and bad vibes. Pre Pleasure is all pristine, gently loping arrangements and reminders to stay healthy, stay happy, have some fun. It’s not a live, laugh, love album as much as a reminder to let yourself off the hook every once in a while. As Jacklin whispers on Ignore Tenderness, with more than a tiny wink: “Go on, let it all out.” SD

43

Suede – Autofiction

On Suede’s ninth album, Brett Anderson is in a reflective mood, contemplating the loss of his mother and his roles as a father, lover and performer, and how the latter cross paths with the younger versions of himself that populate his memories. It’s a nostalgic nook that many rock stars of his vintage find themselves in once they hit middle age – but unlike many rock stars of his vintage, Anderson bucks the expectation to frame these ruminations as a swan song. Instead he tackles them with all the guts, rage and euphoria of a young man with those evolutions and incarnations still ahead of him. LS

Alex G – God Save the Animals

Finding faith … Alex G. Photograph: Chris Maggio

When asked by Pitchfork why his ninth album was so awash in religious imagery, Alex Giannascoli replied: “A few people that I’m close to became religious. It made me wonder what they found.” God Save the Animals suggests that what they found may have been, plainly, ease – a contentment and faith in the world that’s been hard to find on Giannascoli’s past few albums. Although he may be as neurotic and searching as ever, God Save the Animals finds him zeroing in on tiny moments of relief from the anxieties of the world, trudging up a never-ending hill and telling himself a mantra steeped in earnestness and irony: “Every day is a blessing.” SD

41

Oliver Sim – Hideous Bastard

The greatest trick pulled by the xx is in how joint singers Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim dissolve their personal perspectives into an alluring, all-embracing whole. But on Sim’s debut album, he considers the many ways he has tried to disappear in his life – denial, fear, isolation, shame – and weighs up their cost. The antidote, Hideous Bastard suggests, is in unvarnished, often unflattering honesty; the slinky, seductive, often twisted music, produced by Sim’s bandmate Jamie xx, creates the perfect uncanny spotlight for it.

Alabaster DePlume – Gold – Go Forward in the Courage of Your Love

Sincere mission … Alabaster DePlume. Photograph: Chris Almeida

One of the year’s most confronting albums didn’t deal in noise or aggression, but deeply insistent compassion. “Don’t forget you’re precious,” the Manchester jazz poet insists across Gold, one of the album’s many such mantras. These are hard messages for anyone inclined to self-criticism to hear – and DePlume (AKA Gus Fairbairn) counts himself among them, laying bare his struggle to remember his own worth. In doing so he dodges the sentimentality that might otherwise overwhelm a record that proceeds with both palms held upright to the sky. And the sincerity of his mission is evident in its real-world application, with the eerie rhythms, heart-caressing vocal harmonies and vulnerable horns imperceptibly stitched together from days of improvisation with various different ensembles. If we can’t remember that we’re precious, he seems to suggest, being in community with others might remind us. LS

The Weather Station – How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars

Tamara Lindeman couldn’t have had any idea what was to come when she sat down at the piano from 10–12 March 2020 to record How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars. On the companion album to last year’s Ignorance, she weighs up what kind of uncertainty we can tolerate living with – and what the point of certainty is in a world in flux. Her conclusions, at least when it comes to politics and the environment, are less than reassuring. But she threads her anxieties with a resonant confidence that love, as unpredictable as it is, remains a risk worth investing in, the Joni-like spirit in her vocals undimmed. LS

38

Bad Bunny – Un Verano Sin Ti

The year’s most streamed album is an old-fashioned romantic epic. Un Verano Sin Ti’s achingly wistful tale of hedonism and heartbreak has a booze-soaked, tearstained mood; it feels tangentially indebted to classic literature (I hear the Bad Bunny of Un Verano Sin Ti, constantly jerking between the heat of partying and ice-cold alienation, as a perverse analogue to Neddy Merrill, from Cheever’s The Swimmer) as well as cinematic worldbuilding breakup albums such as Lorde’s Melodrama. Bad Bunny pairs his heartbroken missives with sublime reggaeton, dembow and bachata, as well as surprising moments of softness courtesy of indie artists such as the Marías, Buscabulla and Bomba Estéreo. He flits effortlessly between raucous party-starting and moments of wounded introversion, distilling all the divine drama of summer into 81 intoxicating, all-too-short minutes. SD

37

Wu-Lu – Loggerhead

Loggerhead is a little like a zombie movie where Wu-Lu is the lone survivor, a muffled voice of humanity trying to make out any remnants of life in an environment that no longer feels familiar. He stalks the album’s diffuse post-punk landscapes, alternately yelling and mumbling, singing and rapping, letting out a harsh, piercing scream during South, the record’s centrepiece. The closest comparison for this remarkable, haunted debut album would perhaps be enigmatic London experimentalist Dean Blunt, but where Blunt’s main mode is detachment, Wu-Lu seeks out the visceral and the guttural, making an indelible impression in the process. SD

36

Sharon Van Etten – We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong

At the dawn of the 2020s, Sharon Van Etten, like so many others, began to feel the natural world revolt. Her sixth album is her response – not a raging polemic, but an attempt to answer the question she asks on Darkish: “Where will we be when our world is done?” Over a thunder of synths and guitars, she writes love songs to her child and partner, attempts to make peace with her anxieties about motherhood, sex and self-image. As the album crescendos with the magnificent Mistakes, she unleashes a torrent of intermingled pain and joy: “Even when I make a mistake / It’s much better than that!” SD

35

Björk – Fossora

If Björk’s last album, 2017’s Utopia, was about an idealised version of life, she told us in August, then Fossora represented the real world: “Let’s see what it’s like when you walk into this fantasy and, you know, have a lunch and farrrrt and do normal things, like meet your friends.” Naturally, Björk’s musical rendering of domestic life didn’t hold much truck with verité depictions of daily life. Instead, she twisted an artillery of bass clarinets, gabber beats and that famously abundant vocal range into a typically idiosyncratic vision of community inspired by mushrooms and matrilineage. LS

In a world of rigid thinking and hard borders between countries and sounds, the Belgium-based duo make their lunge towards freedom. “Thank yourself / Praise your body / Celebrate and dance,” they urge. Liberation can be found in the body, they suggest – in reclaimed sexuality, a clear mind and a deep belly laugh – and they supply the tools to help get us there: the funk, the slink and a reminder of the pleasures of not taking life too seriously.

Oren Ambarchi / Johan Berthling / Andreas Werliin – Ghosted

In another typically prolific year for Oren Ambarchi, the Australian guitarist picked up the baton with some of his most enduring collaborators, the Swedes double bassist Johan Berthling and drummer Andreas Werliin. Ghosted is a hypnotic exploration of groove that seems to strip back over the course of its four already impressively lean songs: I is busy and curious; II shudders and flickers over a single repeated fretboard harmonic refrain. The eerie, pattering III starts leading the trio into the shadows before IV slips into the realm of hushed doom jazz plied by Bohren und der Club of Gore. As good an entry point as any into a rich catalogue (try Ambarchi’s glorious 2022 solo album Shebang, for one). LS

Yaya Bey – Remember Your North Star

Yaya Bey’s superlative second record is one of the year’s coolest, a heady mix of R&B and jazz that’s lived-in, conversational, meticulous; acidic in its humour and boundless in its empathy. Songs such as Keisha and Meet Me in Brooklyn are filled with subtle interlocking parts but never feel busy: the production equivalent of no-makeup makeup, they provide perfectly minimal backing for Bey to unspool her lackadaisical but painstakingly composed lyrics about relationships, work and Black womanhood. Recalling incisive, free-spirited chroniclers of sex and romance such as SZA and Cookie Mueller, Bey provides a much-needed voice for 21st-century singles everywhere, getting lost in love and looking good doing it.

Pusha T – It’s Almost Dry

Four years after his career-rejuvenating instant classic Daytona, Pusha T returned with It’s Almost Dry, arguably his sharpest and most appealingly persnickety album since his peak Clipse days. Unlike on Daytona, there’s no Drake beef here to draw Push’s ire; instead, his lyrics are all about petty rifts and decades-old dramas, scores that can only be settled with excoriating, ice-cold wordplay. While the credits list seems bloated – It’s Almost Dry is stacked with household names including Kanye West, Jay-Z, Pharrell, Kid Cudi and Lil Uzi Vert, and features a Beyoncé sample on grandiose highlight Rock n Roll – the focus is squarely on Pusha, as, nearly 20 years on from his first commercial peak, he re-establishes himself as one of the era’s most vital rappers.

36,‘Angry winter’: Germany’s Monday night protests unite far-right and left,"“Shed your sense of powerlessness, take to the street!” a man calls from a megaphone, his cry echoed by hundreds of demonstrators walking alongside him who repeat the chant. “Germany’s going to the dogs, wake up from your sleep!”

Carrying banners and posters, some with strings of Christmas lights draped around their necks, banging drums, others holding blank pieces of paper out of sympathy with Chinese protesters banned from objecting to coronavirus lockdowns, the participants make their fears and anger known during a one-hour procession through the snow-sprinkled streets of the eastern German city of Halle.

Their main concerns are soaring energy costs – they urge the government to repair and reopen the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Russia – inflation, which is at its highest level for 70 years, and the war in Ukraine, to which they believe Germany should not be contributing weapons.

“This is a time to make your voice heard,” Manfred, an accountant, says. “Otherwise you are like a sheep just passively accepting all the shit that’s being thrown at you.”

It is a Monday and for several years, Monday night protests – drawing attention to everything from the “over-Islamification” of Germany to “dictatorial” Covid prevention measures – have become a mainstay on the calendar of many German towns and cities in the former GDR or communist east.

In recent months, it is the cost-of-living crisis that has driven the agenda, with Germans in the east having been hit disproportionately hard by rising prices, owing to having lower wages, smaller pensions and less long-term accumulated wealth – whether property, inheritance or investments – than those in western Germany.

Observers have watched with varying degrees of fascination and horror to see in some cases the far-right and far-left in effect join forces for the first time to voice their anger, as a “heiße Herbst” (hot autumn) has turned into what organisers and media refer to as a “Wut Winter” (angry winter).

To what extent the collaboration was planned or not it is hard to say. But what has emerged is a growing sense of cooperation due to an overlap of issues, elegantly compared to a “horse shoe” shape (the ends of which curve towards each other). There are suggestions that there might even be the possibility of both camps – the far-right AfD and the far-left Die Linke, or breakaway elements of that party, Sahra Wagenknecht and her husband Oskar Lafontaine, the erstwhile Social Democrat finance minister – entering government together.

Everyone is invited into the fold. “Have courage and join us, even if it’s just for a brief while,” a woman in an orange anorak says to onlookers through a microphone, speaking in time to the drum beat.

A music teacher, who gives her name as Janine and does not want her employer to know she’s participating, says she feels empowered by the crowd. “The most important thing for me is that we’re all together, venting our frustration and worries, not sitting at home alone hugging hot-water bottles and wondering how on earth we’ll get through this winter, and then the next,” she says.

Demonstrators’ demands to the government include dropping sanctions against Russia so that it is persuaded to resume its gas flows, doing away with coronavirus restrictions, a rent cap, “and an end to all the insanity”, the protest leader shouts shrilly, to cheers.

The protests are a throwback to 1989, when demonstrations by civil rights campaigners against the police state culminated in the peaceful fall of the Berlin Wall but many are offended by the comparison. In nearby Leipzig, they have hung banners from churches that were at the heart of the communist-era protests, reading: “2022 is not 1989 – we’re not living in a dictatorship”.

The organisers disagree. They compare what they see as heavy-handed, top-down decisions by the state – whether regarding pandemic restrictions (mask-wearing rules are still in place in most parts of Germany) or the decision to place sanctions on Russia as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine – with the authoritarian rule in the GDR. The desire for “Selbstbestimmung” or “self-determination” is frequently expressed and has become something of a buzzword.

Whereas in the past, Monday night demonstrators were more discerning about who they marched alongside, recent surveys show the barriers are down, with 67% in a recent survey saying it was “irrelevant” to them who had called the protest, the reasons for calling it were seen as more important.

The attitude towards the protesters has also changed. In the not-too-distant past their demands were often interpreted as outrageous, or at best out of touch, but sympathy towards them is on the rise. In a recent poll by the broadcaster MDR, 80% said they could understand why people felt compelled to go out on to the streets.

Protest numbers may have fallen since the government introduced emergency measures in October to dampen the effect of high energy and living costs (colder weather may also have put people off, organisers admit), but a passionate core is still using the opportunity to vent its anger. Others are deciding whether to join in.

Standing by a camper van from which Glühwein is being dispensed and contemplating whether to join the protest or merely observe it from the sidelines, Johann Schroder asks: “Am I being radical if I decide to take part in a demonstration because I fear not being able to feed myself or heat my home – and what’s more … I don’t trust the powers-that-be to sort this out anytime soon, or come to that, to prevent war spreading to Germany?”

He concludes: “Well, that is a perverse insinuation.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/angry-winter-germanys-monday-night-protests-unite-far-right-and-left,2022-12-07T00:00:00
37,Georgia’s runoff was a resounding rebuke of Trumpism. Will Republicans hear it? | Lloyd Green,"Tuesday delivered a spate of bad news for Donald Trump and the Republican party. First, Bennie Thompson, chairman of the January 6 committee, announced that criminal referrals to the US Department of Justice would be forthcoming. A few hours later, a Manhattan jury convicted the Trump Organization on 17 counts of tax fraud, conspiracy and falsification. According to prosecutors, the former president was complicit.

And now, the incumbent senator Raphael Warnock has prevailed in a hard-fought runoff. Georgia again rejected Herschel Walker and Donald Trump, his patron.

Come January, Mitch McConnell and his Republican colleagues in the US Senate will be staring at an actual 51-49 Democratic majority. The president’s nominees will have an easier time winning confirmation. In the end, the minority leader and his caucus will bear a portion of the cost of those abortions Walker reportedly paid for.

The ex-University of Georgia football great now joins the ranks of other Trump-endorsed casualties: Pennsylvania’s Dr Oz and Doug Mastriano; Arizona’s Kari Lake and Blake Masters; Michigan’s Tudor Dixon. Unfortunately for them, swing-state America yearned for normal.

Trump’s big lie emerged as a turn-off. His recent call for the US constitution to be scrapped injured himself and Walker.

By the numbers, “three in 10 strong Trump supporters accept or are indifferent to white supremacist views,” according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll taken in the aftermath of the hate-fest in Charlottesville.

The Republican party is its own twilight zone. But Georgia is no longer Trump country.

The Republican party is its own twilight zone. But Georgia is no longer Trump country

He lost the Peach state to Biden two years ago. On the eve of the January 2021 insurrection, both of his picks finished second in the state’s Senate runoffs. Walker’s flame-out is part of the continuum.

In contrast to Walker, Governor Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican incumbent, threaded the political needle. On election day last month, he won despite defying Trump.

Most notably, the governor and his posse refused to nullify the 2020 election. Kemp even testified before a Fulton county, Georgia, grand jury, which may yet indict “45” and his hangers-on. Rudy Giuliani is officially a target in the inquiry. Jeopardy is in the air.

In hindsight, helping preserve democracy from Trump’s onslaught proved itself to be smart politics. This past May, Kemp, Georgia’s attorney general Chris Carr, and Brad Raffensperger, Trump’s bete noire and Georgia’s secretary of state, all survived primary challenges. Courage can come with an upside.

On that note, Jay Walker, a Kemp adviser, repeatedly told deep-pocketed donors that the governor was ready to gut his primary challenger, David Perdue, Trump’s pick and a defeated former US senator. “We’re going to go fucking scorched-earth,” Walker supposedly said.

Most recently, Kemp took aim at Trump for his dinner with Ye, the antisemitic recording artist formerly known as Kanye West, and Nick Fuentes, his white supremacist, Holocaust-denying sidekick. “Racism, antisemitism, and denial of the Holocaust have no place in the Republican Party and are completely un-American,” Kemp told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Sadly, he stands out as an exception within the Republican party. Once upon a time, Trump and his legal minions brayed against tyranny. Not any more.

With Trump in office it was hello, praetorian. These days, it’s crickets and spinelessness.

Take Jay Sekulow, Trump’s personal lawyer. In an April 2016 brief to the US supreme court, Sekulow attacked Obama as a despot.

Echoing James Madison, founding father and fourth president, Sekulow thundered that the “accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and judiciary, in the same hands … may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny”.

Likewise, McConnell and 44 of his Republican colleagues accused Obama of seeking to “usurp” their powers when it came to recess appointments. To be sure, McConnell has remained silent in the face of ethnic slurs hurled at his wife by Trump.

Fittingly, the family of Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, refused to shake hands with McConnell and the Trump toady Kevin McCarthy at a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony. Ken Sicknick, the late officer’s brother, told CBS News that the Republican leaders “have no idea what integrity is”.

In 2016, Paul LePage, then governor of Maine, actually treated Trump’s bubbling authoritarianism as a plus. “Our constitution is not only broken,” he declared. “We need a Donald Trump to show some authoritarian power in our country.”

LePage’s dream is the Republicans’ reality – and democracy’s nightmare. “When someone tells you they want to abolish the constitution … and they’re a wannabe dictator, believe them,” Olivia Troye, Mike Pence’s national security adviser, tweeted. “And when Republicans refuse to condemn it, believe what that means as well.”

The question facing Kemp and the rest of the Republican leadership is whether they confront their Caesar. One thing is certain: if elected, Walker would have willingly rolled over. And he is far from alone.

“The real question is what does the base of the party think,” Senator Mitt Romney recently acknowledged. “And they’re still firmly behind him.”",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/07/georgias-runoff-was-a-resounding-rebuke-of-trumpism-will-republicans-hear-it,2022-12-07T00:00:00
38,Cop15 negotiators have left their homework to the last minute – can they scrape a pass? | Patrick Greenfield,"All procrastinators know the feeling: an enormous task is not close to being finished, time is slipping away and the pressure to act has become impossible to ignore. But despite the mounting unease, there is still not yet enough pressure to take action, and it is unclear if there ever will be.

At the Palais des congrès de Montréal convention centre at Cop15, after more than two years of delays, there is a sense that governments tasked with agreeing this decade’s targets for protecting life on Earth are in just such a situation.

These summits are rare events. The last meeting of this kind took place 12 years ago in Japan, a few months into David Cameron’s first term as the UK’s prime minister, the same year One Direction was formed, Spain celebrated its first World Cup victory and an Icelandic volcano disrupted air traffic in Europe.

The nature summit is a long way from the sunshine, coral reefs and intermittent food and water supplies of Cop27 in Egypt just two weeks ago, the quirks of an authoritarian dictatorship replaced by the bite of a Canadian winter and poutine.

There are good reasons for optimism: nature has shot up the international agenda during the pandemic. From Emmanuel Macron to Xi Jinping, world leaders say they want an ambitious deal to stop the loss of biodiversity. Montreal produced one of the most successful environmental agreements in history on the ozone layer in 1987, which continues to recover slowly.

Cop15 could be a punctuation point in history where everything finally starts to change and humanity plots a path to living in harmony with nature – if the tendency toward procrastination can be overcome. One million species are at risk of extinction and limiting global heating to 1.5C is on the line, but many negotiators have the look of a university student who has left their dissertation to the final few days of their course.

Next week, ministers will arrive in Canada to inspect what the negotiators have been doing for the past two years at meetings in Rome, Geneva, Nairobi and countless Zoom calls. In all UN environment talks, ministers arrive at the point when most of the agreement is finished and the difficult bits need to be sorted out.

Unless something changes radically, an awesome pile of documents awaits Thérèse Coffey, the UK secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, and her fellow environment ministers: a Frankenstein’s monster of ideas and suggestions from 196 countries on the 22 draft targets and four goals the world should agree to protect its biodiversity that they will have a just few days to bring into coherent life.

At the time of writing, negotiators have a week to work through more than 1,400 brackets – which reflect disagreement in a UN negotiation.

“I think the ministers are going to sack us all,” says one negotiator in the halls of the convention centre. “At the moment, it’s a horror show.”

Most university students who have left it late do not run the risk of embarrassing a superpower. But in Montreal, negotiators have no such luck. China is in charge of this Cop, which was meant to be held in Kunming in 2020, but was finally moved because of the country’s zero- Covid policy.

Before the pandemic, the Chinese government had been sounding out the French on how to capture the magic that led to the Paris climate agreement. This side of the pandemic, they are having to work with Canada – a few weeks after Xi and Justin Trudeau clashed after months of bilateral tensions – to get the bare minimum over the line. As Denmark learned at the climate Cop15 in 2009, it will be seen as the hosts’ fault if they do not succeed.

Publicly, the UN, NGOs and governments are quick to say that everything is fine: China is doing a great job and has shown fantastic leadership throughout the process. Part one of Cop15, which took place last year in Kunming last year, was entirely ceremonial, and they have been good enough to move the summit.

Privately, it is a different story. There is sympathy for Chinese organisers who have endured several three-week quarantines and little time with their families. But many are not convinced by the political buy-in.

“China is absent, has already de facto checked out and will play an irrelevant and ceremonial role. I was told by my friends in Beijing that the Communist party leaders are not interested in this conference: ‘We had our photo opportunity last year, now we leave the Canadians to wash the dishes’,” says one observer.

It is hard to know the full truth. China is playing a noticeably withdrawn and limited role, even by its own standards. At Cop27, their negotiators would speak with the international media. This time, their environment minister Huang Runqiu – the Cop15 president in the Alok Sharma role who is meant to cajole countries into agreement – does not go beyond selected questions and lengthy statements about how much China has done for Cop15.

It does not bode well for the difficult decisions that await negotiators and ministers in the coming days. But it appears that Canada is aware of this, working away to guide the agreement. Everything and nothing are still possible.

39,"Horribly low pay is pushing out my fellow authors – and yes, that really does matter | Joanne Harris","I have made a career out of being an author. It has been a great privilege to be able to do that. But I am deeply saddened that the job I love has become inaccessible and unsustainable for others – and increasingly ruled by luck.

I’m not talking about the luck that plays a part in the writing process, or in getting our work in front of the right agent or the right editor at the right time. I’m talking about the luck that comes later, once our work has been signed and contracted, and we’ve earned our way to the status of professional author. That, according to the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society’s (ALCS) fourth major round of research into authors’ incomes, published on Tuesday, is when the real luck comes into play.

We arrive at what we imagined would be the creative heart of an industry, but it turns out to be a room full of slot machines. Some of us are lucky enough to feed the right slot at the right time and hit jackpots of varying sizes. Others bring their own luck to the room – they can afford to feed the slots regardless of what they get in return. But what about everyone else? Who can honestly afford to stay?

The trouble with luck is that it is not a reliable foundation for a profession. Nor is it a reliable way to run an industry. Yet here we are.

When the ALCS first ran its survey of author incomes in 2006 it found that the median self-employed income of a full-time author was £12,330. In 2022 – a year in which multiple publishers have posted record profits while freelancers in all professions are still reeling from the impact of Covid-19, Brexit and rising living costs – the median full-time income has fallen to £7,000. That’s a drop of more than 60% when accounting for inflation.

There is also a more worrying, granular luck at play. The gender pay gap is getting worse – men earn 41% more than women (compared with 33% five years ago). Payment for Black and mixed-heritage authors is a full 51% lower than for white authors. Young authors earn less, as do older ones. Fewer authors than ever are receiving advances, and groups of authors who are statistically less likely to be able to support themselves through other means earn an even less affordable cut.

People are being paid less than half a living wage for their creative labour. The ALCS points to this as evidence of a global trend of the “devaluing of creative labour”. I agree – we see it everywhere: in the calls to work for nothing, in the initiatives to offer unfettered free access to creative work, in mass subscription models designed to serve corporations at the expense of creators.

The report shows a drop in the proportion of full-time authors from 40% of those surveyed in 2006 to just 19% today. This shows that we cannot keep relying on the assumption that people will find money from elsewhere to sustain their writing: many are leaving the profession.

At the Society of Authors, we have major concerns about what this means for the future of earning a living as an author. We daily offer support to writers, illustrators and translators to negotiate better contract terms or avoid poor deals, to educate them on business practices and self-promotion, and to give them the skills and knowledge to navigate a complex industry. We empower them where possible to remove luck from the equation and replace it with business sense.

But we can’t remove all the slots. Based on the ALCS’s findings, an author’s business sense alone won’t make it affordable for them to sustain their career. The report is likely to dissuade some potential authors from ever considering a creative career. Others already established are probably looking at other options and, based on the report’s findings, of the voices we lose, my worry is that they are more likely to be the ones that we most need to hear.

Writing as a profession is becoming inaccessible and unsustainable for too many. We need to start seeing contracts with fair payment, higher advances, better payment terms, better control of rights and clearer accounting, as we’ve called for in the Society of Authors’ Creator campaign.

Readers value a wide range of books and authors. Most of us don’t want our choice restricted to a small selection of books by a narrow range of authors, so we need to make this a viable profession for everyone.

With the top 10% of authors currently earning about 47% of all author earnings, it is time to spread the money more equitably to ensure that creators – the people whose work makes the industry possible – aren’t left relying on chance.

40,Memo to Just Stop Oil and everyone risking all to save the planet: we need a rethink | Feyzi Ismail,"The battle between climate protesters and the government is raging, and most people know who is in the right. The people trying to sound the alarm about the climate crisis are closer to mainstream opinion than those enabling fossil fuel corporations to make almost $3bn a day in profit while the planet burns.

Many in the government probably know it too, but to openly confront that reality would mean doing the unthinkable: pointing to corporate short-termism as the source of the crisis.

The default alternative is to crack down on the right to protest. This is unlikely to deter the protesters, as Just Stop Oil has vowed to defy the law until the government imposes the death penalty. However hard Suella Braverman and Rishi Sunak might try, they can’t legislate away determination, commitment and, well, the science.

But here’s the dilemma for the protesters: the government can indeed start to take out individual protesters through long prison sentences, unlimited fines and seizing their stuff. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act allows the police broad powers to restrict protest, based on what they interpret to be serious disruption – if a protest is too noisy, for example, or protesters are deemed to be causing a public nuisance, such as occupying a public space. The public order bill goes even further. It extends stop and search, and introduces serious disruption prevention orders – you can’t hang out in the wrong place with the wrong people if you have been convicted of a protest-related offence twice before.

These measures won’t stop protest, but they do challenge our strategy and tactics. A Just Stop Oil protester was recently sentenced to six months in prison for climbing a gantry on the M25. National Highways has secured a high court injunction that lasts until November next year against protests on the M25, with specific individuals named. More and more activists are being found guilty of criminal damage and going to prison for being disruptive. This number looks set to rise as arrests are already in the thousands and mounting.

The type of protest considered acceptable to government is rapidly shrinking. This is a massive threat to democracy. And this is why, as the government starts to crack down, the climate movement needs to step up, to raise its game. Some tactics can make it too easy for the government to drive a wedge between protesters and the wider public. Getting arrested regularly is not something most people can afford to do. Preventing ordinary people from getting to work or hospital inevitably alienates, making criminalisation easier. The protesters must not allow the government to score on that front.

‘The focus must include supporting wider protests about the cost of living crisis and the war in Ukraine.’ Just Stop Oil protesters at the People’s Assembly march in London, 5 November 2022. Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/Shutterstock

The other tactical dilemma for Just Stop Oil is that the protests remain in the same register and rely on a few brave individuals. Another day, another gallery. Tomato soup, mashed potatoes, chocolate cake. It keeps the media talking – and this is essential – but who are they trying to persuade? The government, who won’t be persuaded? Ordinary people, who are already aware of the depth and scale of the crisis?

With governments moving intolerably slowly in doing what is necessary, it falls on ordinary people, including those on the frontline of the effects of the climate crisis, to intervene. As it happens, they also have the power to transform things.

A step up means that, rather than coming into confrontation with ordinary people, the climate movement seeks common cause with their struggles. A dual strategy follows from this, and is gaining increasing attention from within the movement.

First, the focus must include maximising street protest over the climate, and supporting wider protests about the cost of living crisis and the war in Ukraine, both of them tightly linked with energy policy. While direct action over energy is crucial, it was encouraging to see Just Stop Oil and others on the climate bloc at the recent People’s Assembly demonstration over the cost of living crisis.

Second, the movement must identify with the rising militancy among trade unions and working people – those who can stop production, whether it’s oil and gas or SUVs. This means supporting the strikes over pay and conditions, turning up to picket lines and mobilising numbers to organise the biggest movements possible.

This is starting to happen, and Just Stop Oil is supporting striking workers at the UK’s largest oil refinery at Fawley in Hampshire, operated by ExxonMobil, which recorded £17.3bn in profits over the last quarter. We need more of this kind of action, where the climate movement and labour militancy come together.

Persuasive arguments are being made for the climate movement to make a strategic refocus on production rather than consumption. This is because the crisis isn’t mainly about consumption, important though that is. It is mainly about the way production is organised, what is produced and who profits from that production.

The protesters are not selfish or reckless, as transport secretary Mark Harper claims. Nor are they extremists, as Suella Braverman wants us to believe.

It is those who are blocking change who are the real extremists. Make no mistake, the protesters must continue. But by expanding the range of tactics, and by making a strategic turn towards those who have real power in society, we would become unstoppable.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/07/just-stop-oil-risk-save-the-planet-rethink-protest,2022-12-07T00:00:00
41,"As the Michelle Mone PPE scandal deepens, ministers can no longer feign ignorance | Linsey McGoey","On Tuesday, the Conservative peer Michelle Mone announced she was taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords, to “clear her name”, after she became the centre of a growing scandal over PPE procurement. Leaked documents suggest Mone and her family secretly received £29m from the firm PPE Medpro after she recommended the company to ministers, and helped it secure access to the government’s “VIP lane” procurement stream. It was later revealed that she also lobbied aggressively for a second firm with links to her husband’s family office. Mone didn’t disclose her financial interest in PPE Medpro in the House of Lords register, but it certainly looks as if she benefited financially.

But who is to say for sure? Who holds the people “who count” accountable? Not Rishi Sunak or his government, if they can help it. To condemn Mone is to condemn their own cronyism, so they’d rather turn a blind eye. The revelations about procurement profiteering keep piling up, and yet the government has weathered it by studiously ignoring the problem. And so far, it has worked.

There’s a phrase for this: strategic ignorance – the dismissal or ignoring of inconvenient information because it’s not in one’s interest to acknowledge it. People do it all the time. Indeed, there may even be positive psychological value in it: meditation, keeping your mobile phone out of the bedroom – these are examples of periodic strategic ignorance, and they can be cathartic and life-affirming.

But when the government makes an artform of it, the costs are too great to dismiss. A democratic government is elected to nurture life and protect the public, not to act like it’s on a never-ending mindfulness retreat. When someone acts as if they simply didn’t know, we may be inclined to treat them less harshly. But when vast amounts of public funds are at stake, we shouldn’t.

While the urge to ignore might be a universal aspect of our shared human frailty – ignorance is bliss – not everyone’s unknowing ignorance is the same. Some people’s ignorance is imposed from above, through government refusals to fund broadband access or public schooling. While for others, their ignorance might seem accidental or involuntary – even when it’s not. Often, ignorance can be cultivated to avoid liability for corporate harms or to give the boss plausible deniability. Remember Rupert Murdoch and hacking-gate? There are hierarchies of ignorance – and in today’s world, the Tory government is at the top of the hierarchy. Its ignorance appears deliberate, and it has caused untold harm.

Look at PPE procurement mismanagement during the Covid pandemic. We know gross mistakes were made. Two years ago, the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy released a scathing report on government failures. Investigative efforts at the Good Law Project suggested that a “VIP lane” for PPE procurement, created in March 2020, was more like a gravy-train for Tory pals. Companies without any prior experience in supplying necessary materials were showered with billions in contracts – a lot of it on undelivered goods.

Two years on, a familiar pattern is clear. Although the Department of Health and Social Care acknowledged fraud might have figured in the wasted billions on undelivered, subpar products, there’s been little accountability. An article in the British Medical Journal sums up the problem: “The Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office have both produced meticulous evidence which would support an investigation, but it is yet to be acted on.”

The government mantra seems to be: see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil.

The larger problem is the way that such strategic ignorance perpetuates myths about “market efficiency”. By turning a blind eye to relentless profiteering on the public dime, the problem of corporate predation is minimised. This gives the private sector a sort of alibi. The Covid PPE gravy-train is just the tip of a longer iceberg of wasted money showered on companies through private finance initiatives over the years, by left- and rightwing governments. But instead of systematically questioning why shovelling public money into dodgy private-sector initiatives has been the default government position, scandals are ignored as if they don’t indicate a bigger problem.

And you can be sure the next time a big tranche of public money is made available for some emergency, the same cycle will repeat itself. How much fraud, how much squandering of taxpayer money needs to take place before such a presumption is exposed for the ruse it is?

In the case of the Tories, part of the problem is that they are not seen as directing the state towards specific ends. Their own claims of being hands-off and laissez-faire have been taken at face value. “Unlike the right,” Andrew Marr recently wrote in the New Statesman, “the left is comfortable using state power – and government intervention is exactly what Britain needs.”

But in reality, the right has long been happy with state intervention – it is just a lot more cagey about it than the left. The quietude serves various ends. As long as privileges showered on the rich are veiled, it’s easier to make it seem like the poor are the “scroungers”. In truth, the real benefits claimants are the rich.

The pretence of laissez-faire is the most durable ignorance alibi of the modern era. It enables corrupt governments to pretend it is an invisible hand that moves markets and not their own hands, deep in the honey jar.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/07/mone-ppe-procurement-scandal-ministers-feign-ignorance,2022-12-07T00:00:00
42,I accidentally pepper-sprayed myself in the face. What’s worse is admitting I feel unsafe in Philadelphia | Arwa Mahdawi,"‘Bad things happen in Philadelphia,” Donald Trump once warned. Last weekend, a very bad thing happened in Philadelphia: I pepper-sprayed myself in the face. I had bought some pepper spray keyrings online because, after a spate of armed robberies in my neighbourhood, I was worried about walking my dog at night.

My dog is the size of a large rat so he doesn’t really deter bad guys – unless the bad guys are scared of rats. Anyway, I had gone out to the garden to test the spray – I’m not a complete idiot, I didn’t want to inhale that stuff in a confined space – and managed to get some droplets on my face. At first it was kind of pleasant. A nice little tingle. An exhilarating Philly facial. Then it started getting painful. Then I rubbed my eyes and …. yikes! 0/10 do not recommend.

You think admitting I pepper-sprayed myself is embarrassing? As a proud progressive, admitting that I feel unsafe in Philadelphia feels way more embarrassing. Rightwingers in the US are obsessed with the narrative that Democrat-led cities such as Philadelphia are dystopian hellscapes where you will almost certainly be killed if you step out of your house.

While the right cynically politicises crime (Fox News slashed its crime coverage in half after the midterm elections), they’re not entirely wrong about the problem. Shootings have surged in Philadelphia since the pandemic. By early August, more than 1,400 people had been shot in the city this year. Gun violence is out of control.

The right blames this violence on liberals and the movement to defund the police: Philadelphia has a famously progressive district attorney who, they argue, is too easy on criminals. The real reason for all this violence, however, is that Philadelphia has high rates of poverty and easy access to guns. That’s not a winning combination.

The antidote for all this violence isn’t rocket science. You increase social safety nets; you decrease poverty; you decrease access to guns. Unfortunately, there seems to be zero will in the US to do any of this. Which is great news for the pepper-spray industry and bad news for everyone else.

43,World Cup 2022: Infantino hails ‘best ever’ group stage after rise of Africa and Asia – live,"1m ago 10.03 EST In technological innovations you never knew you needed, Fifa have produced their latest rankings of the Peter Kay ‘ave it factor™, or the “most powerful Fifa World Cup goal ranking” as they’ve called it. Thanks to the “connected ball technology” they can tell us that: Leading the Top 10 goals from the group stage and round of 16 combined is Luis Chávez’s spectacular free-kick, in Mexico’s 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia. on match day three. The distance to goal was 29.19m, with a top speed of 121.69 km/h. The distance to goal is measured from where the ball is kicked, to the centre of the goal - straight line, not flight path. Ritsu Dōan’s 120.04 km/h strike for Japan from just outside the box to make it 1-1 against Spain is currently the second fastest shot that led to a goal, with Germany’s Niclas Füllkrug’s goal – also against La Roja – in third place. Hakim Ziyech of Morocco leads the table for goals by ‘distance travelled’. His fourth minute goal against Canada in the group stage was struck 32.85 metres from goal.

The UEFA Women’s Champions League group stage is approaching the sharper end, with matchday four. Group C features Lyon Féminines v Zürich Women (17.45 GMT) and Arsenal Women v Juventus Femminile (20.00 GMT). We will have MBM coverage of the latter. Group D has Rosengård Women v Benfica Women as the early kick-off, and FC Bayern München Ladies v Barcelona Femenino at 8pm. There is also football on your terrestrial tellybox if you are in the UK. ITV4 have got live coverage of the FA Cup second round replay between Stockport County and Charlton Athletic. That kicks off at 7.45pm. And before that, at 7pm, my Leyton Orient are live-streaming their FA Youth Cup tie against AFC Wimbledon for free. My kids will be absolutely thrilled that I’m still managing to ignore them in favour of live football.



1h ago 08.49 EST Ciarán Fahey writes for AP that soccer in Germany faces a day of decisions amid questions over the futures of both national team coach Hansi Flick and league chief executive Donata Hopfen. The German soccer federation was meeting Wednesday to discuss the fallout from Germany’s early World Cup exit and simmering issues of discontent among Bundesliga clubs and teams from the second division. Federation president Bernd Neuendorf was to meet with German soccer league vice president Hans-Joachim Watzke to discuss the future for German soccer after three straight disappointing performances in major tournaments. Germany’s management is under pressure for a marked improvement before the country hosts the 2024 European Championship. The federation also needs a replacement for Oliver Bierhoff, who ended an 18-year stint Monday when he agreed to resign as managing director of Germany’s national soccer teams and academy. Hertha Berlin general manager Fredi Bobic is a reported candidate to take over from Bierhoff, though he said Wednesday he was “very comfortable at Hertha.” Bobic, who has a contract through 2024 with the Berlin club, did not rule himself out, however. Flick’s future as Germany coach remains uncertain amid questions about his team selection and tactics. Flick appeared to criticise the federation for Bierhoff’s exit on Tuesday, when he said both he and his coaching staff “are having a hard time imagining how the gap left by Oliver’s departure can be closed.”



1h ago 08.44 EST Hello everybody, Martin Belam back again. I’m just listening to Kyle Walker at the England press conference in Qatar. You can watch along here too and then I won’t have to take as many notes.



1h ago 08.41 EST Righto, my watch is over. Here’s Martin Belam to narrate you through the rest of your day. Ta-ra.



2h ago 08.30 EST “What went wrong for the USMNT at the World Cup?” wonders Kurt Perelberg. Er, I’m not sure anything did. They might improve over the next four years – Brendon Aaronson, Tyler Adams and others are young – but currently they’re a last-16 side and no better. Though they’ll regret the way they defended against the Netherlands, they’re not as good a team nor do they have as good players.



2h ago 08.21 EST It’s so great to see Morocco doing so well, and their fans wading into the moment. They actually had the talent to make a splash in 2018 – they should’ve beaten Iran in their first game but ended up losing, then did so again to Portugal in their second before taking a point off Spain in their third. I’m not sure how they go about beating Portugal here – though they’ve defended brilliantly, the calibre of attacker they’ll face at the weekend is of a different order to any they’ve seen so far – but they won’t be scared, and they won’t choke.



2h ago 08.10 EST It’s so good to see a balanced Portugal. I thought they had a proper shot at winning the Euros, but Santos couldn’t find the right combination in midfield and attack; he ended up dropping Bruno Fernandes, for example, which made no sense. But he’s now getting the best out of him and the best out of Bernardo Silva – Otavio and William Carvalho looks like a decent combination behind them, whereas things were a bit too slow when Ruben Neves was involved – last night was the best I’ve seen Joao Felix play, and though Goncalo Ramos won’t score thrice in every game, his mobility and explosivity make him a huge upgrade on Ronaldo.



2h ago 08.03 EST I do wonder, though, if England might do well to bring in Kalvin Phillips for Jordan Henderson. I don’t think it’ll happen in this tournament, but I do think it’s a good option. Though Henderson’s leadership and composure are assets, the physical toll it’d take on an opposition playing against three physical, technical monsters, would be significant, and it’d give Rice greater scope to carry the ball without compromising defensive protection.



2h ago 07.58 EST You’ll doubtless be riveted to know that I think a change from 4-3-3 to 3-4-3 would be an error. For the first time in a long time, England have a midfield good enough to compete with France’s, and taking a man out of the middle will limit Jude Bellingham’s ability to get forward and effective cede control of the game to try and win it in moments or on the counter. England could win that way, but I don’t think it’s their best rote to victory – especially without Reece James, worth replacement though Kieran Trippier is.

2h ago 07.50 EST Northern Ireland will fancy their chances of making the 2026 edition; given the size of that competition, my Old Boys team probably will too. Anyhow, they’ve reappointed Michael O’Neill as manager, and he got them to Euro 2016, so there’s pedigree there.



2h ago 07.48 EST I’m not sure Infantino is right about these being the best group stages ever. The last round of matches was dramatic, but quality was pretty low.



2h ago 07.43 EST Tell you what, though, we’ve got some serious football awaiting us. Gareth Southgate and Fernando Santos both seems to have discovered their best formations and XIs in the nick of time so, all things being well, we should get an epic or two in the 10 days or so. We need them, because when it comes down to it, that last 16 was a little disappointing.



2h ago 07.39 EST Thanks Martin and hi everyone. How we all coping with this football-free day? Disgrace, if you ask me?

3h ago 07.22 EST Do you remember club football? Erik ten Hag does, and he has insisted today that Manchester United have moved on from Cristiano Ronaldo’s messy departure. PA Media reports that Ten Hag was not willing to discuss the saga in depth when asked by the club’s in-house TV channel, MUTV, in an interview that was aired on Wednesday. Rather, the Dutchman insisted his focus was on the future. United terminated Ronaldo’s contract after being rocked by an extraordinary series of complaints by him in a TV interview. Ten Hag came in for particular criticism from the 37-year-old forward, who accused the Dutchman of not respecting him. Asked how he had managed the situation, Ten Hag told MUTV: “He’s gone and it’s the past. We are now looking forward and we’re looking to the future.” Ten Hag is confident his players that are in Qatar will hit the ground running when they get back to domestic duty. He said: “We had a plan, we have prepared the players with what the plan is, so there can’t be any confusion about what the programme is. “We make the players aware of the fact that, after you are out of the World Cup, you have to return to the club and the league immediately goes on. You have to be ready for that, but I think our players are used to it.” United face Burnley in a Carabao Cup tie on 21 December – three days after the World Cup final – before hosting Nottingham Forest in the Premier League six days later.

3h ago 07.11 EST How do we feel about extra time at the World Cup? I’ve seen more than a few people moot that with the truncated tournament length, and it being mid-season, maybe Fifa should have opted to have drawn knockout round matches go straight to penalties after 90 minutes. Then, there’s the question of whether extra time delivers any value in football anyway. So often it feels like thirty minutes of tired players having an aimless kickabout while they wait for penalties. Because I am a complete spod I’ve done some number crunching, and I make it that over the last five World Cups since the ‘golden goal’ rule was abolished, 25 matches in total have gone to extra time. In 15 of those, there was no score during the extra period. That includes the 2006 match between Switzerland and Ukraine which felt not so much like extra time as a collective punishment. So only ten matches that have gone to extra time have seen goals during the additional minutes in 16 years, which doesn’t seem like great entertainment value. Having said that, three of the finals during that time have gone to extra time, and we would have been deprived of Mario Götze and Andrés Iniesta’s dramatic late winners, and that Zinedine Zidane moment of madness. So maybe we should stick with it after all? Do drop me a line with your thoughts on that or anything else – martin.belam@theguardian.com

3h ago 06.38 EST Spain feel like the only team more cursed than England at penalty shootouts. They’ve only won one of the five they’ve faced in World Cups – at Ireland’s expense in 2002. Indeed, Spain has now won only three of its last 11 World Cup games since 2010. There’s no immediate word on the future of coach Luis Enrique, who blamed himself for Spain’s exit yesterday. “It’s my responsibility,” AP reports Enrique said, adding “I picked the first three penalty-takers”. He had previously said that he had asked each of his squad to practise 1,000 penalties with their club sides before the tournament. The coach also said one of his regrets in Qatar was not to have used 30-year-old Pablo Sarabia more often during the tournament. Sarabia came on as a substitute just before the end of extra time “and he created two scoring occasions right away,” Enrique said. “It was my mistake not to have used him more. It wasn’t fair.” Enrique did not say whether he would continue as Spain coach, saying he would “take some time to rest” before start making a decision about his future. That may also have been the last time we see Sergio Busquets in a Span shirt. “Now the important thing is the team and not me,” said the 34-year-old Barcelona midfielder, who made his 17th World Cup appearance yesterday. “We’ll pick ourselves up and use it as a learning experience,” Busquets said. “We’re in a good dynamic, with young people. This is going to make them stronger.” Spain’s qualifying group for Euro 2024 features Norway, Scotland, Georgia and Cyprus, and the team will also be competing in the UEFA Nations League finals in the summer of 2023, where they will face one of Italy, Croatia or the Netherlands in the semi-finals.



4h ago 06.24 EST Fifa's Infantino declares Qatar group stages to be 'best ever' at a World Cup In a not entirely unpredictable move, Fifa head honcho Gianni Infantino has been waxing lyrical about events in Qatar so far and has described the group stage of the tournament as the “best ever” at a World Cup. PA is carrying the following quotes from the man who declared himself to feel Qatari, Arabic, African, gay, disabled and like a migrant worker on the eve of the tournament. I have seen all the matches, indeed, and put very simply and very clearly, this has been the best group stage of a Fifa World Cup ever. So, it’s very promising for the remainder of the Fifa World Cup. The matches have been of great, great quality in beautiful stadiums – we knew that already. However, as well, the public who was there was incredible. Over 51,000 on average. When it comes to stadium attendances, the stadiums are sold-out, full practically at every match. The fan festivals, the different fan zones, are also very crowded with people celebrating. There are no more small teams and no more big teams. The level is very, very equal. For the first time as well, national teams from all continents going to the knockout phase, for the first time in history. This shows that football is really becoming truly global. Not to be a complete pedant about it, but that last claim doesn’t particularly ring true, as in 2010 teams from UEFA, Conmebol, Concacaf, Caf and the AFC all made it to the round of 16, exactly the same set of confederations as this time. Presumably Infantino meant the appearance of Australia made a difference in 2022, but they are members of the AFC. New Zealand lost their intercontinental playoff so there was no representation from the OFC at all in Qatar.



4h ago 06.06 EST We don’t have any World Cup match action today, but we are expecting media appearances from England and France later on. Kyle Walker and Harry Maguire are expected to be the England players up talking to reporters.

4h ago 05.57 EST Belgium's Eden Hazard announces international retirement Belgium captain Eden Hazard announced his retirement from international soccer aged 31 on Wednesday after his team’s group-stage exit at the World Cup. The forward played in all three Group F games but did not score as Belgium beat Canada, lost to Morocco and played out a goalless draw with Croatia to finish third. Hazard made his international debut in 2008 and scored 33 times in 126 appearances. He helped Belgium reach the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, where they lost to eventual champions France, and beat England in the third-placed playoff. “I have decided to put an end to my international career. The succession is ready,” Hazard wrote on Instagram, Reuters reports. “A page turns today … Thank you for your love. Thank you for your unparalleled support. Thank you for all this happiness shared since 2008 … I will miss you.” Belgium coach Roberto Martinez stepped down from his role on Thursday after a disappointing tournament in Qatar.

5h ago 05.27 EST Switzerland’s capitulation to Portugal last night marked their third consecutive round of 16 exit at a World Cup, after a tight 1-0 defeat to Argentina after extra time in 2014, and a 1-0 defeat to Sweden in 2018. The last time Switzerland reached the quarter-finals was as hosts in 1954, when they took part in the highest scoring World Cup match of all-time, an astonishing sounding 7-5 defeat to neighbours Austria in Lausanne. Graham Dunbar at AP has been looking at what lies ahead for the Swiss now, and suggests that none of this squad need head for international retirement. The core trio of goalkeeper Yann Sommer, midfielder and captain Granit Xhaka and playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri are in their early 30s and have much to offer as team leaders. There may be questions over the future of coach Murat Yakin though, whose tactical switch from a defensive line of four to three at the back did them no favours against a rampant Portuguese attack. A somewhat less-than-enthused Shaqiri said after the game “These were his choices, we have to accept them” Yakin has a contract through to the end of Euro 2024, and the Swiss will be fairly confident of qualifying from a group that has placed them with Israel, Romania, Kosovo, Belarus and Andorra, with two teams set to progress to the finals in Germany.

5h ago 04.48 EST Mark Gleeson at Reuters has written that Lionel Messi’s hopes of winning an elusive World Cup will come up against the tactical scheming of veteran coach Louis van Gaal as Argentina face the Netherlands in Friday’s quarter-final at Lusail. That one kicks off at 7pm GMT, and will evoke memories of some classic previous clashes. 71-year-old Van Gaal is determined to give the Dutch their first World Cup title after runners-up finishes in 1974, 1978 and 2010. Argentina won the World Cup in 1978 at the Netherlands’ expense in the final. Photograph: Trinity Mirror/Mirrorpix/Alamy The coach’s planning will largely focus on containing Messi and catching Argentina on the break. The tactical plan is key to his side’s hopes of winning on Friday as the Dutch look to take revenge for their semi-final defeat in 2014 when Argentina beat them in a shootout. “We can surprise teams with our plan. We were also the better team then and Messi didn’t see much of the ball,” the coach told reporters this week. The Netherlands have lost only one of the previous nine games against Argentina - the 1978 World Cup final in Buenos Aires – though they have been beaten in a shootout on two occasions. Van Gaal can also point to a run of form that has seen the Dutch go 19 games without defeat since he returned to the hot seat for a third spell 15 months ago. That includes a run to the finals tournament of the UEFA Nations League, which the Dutch are expected to host next summer.



6h ago 04.13 EST Is it too early to start building up to Brazil v Croatia on Friday? Probably, but who is going to stop me? Certainly not Reuters, which has just published a little fact box about the clash, including these highlights: Brazil have reached at least the quarter-finals in their last eight World Cups. They were champions in 1994 and 2002 and runners-up in 1998, but have only reached the semi-finals once since then – as hosts in 2014 when they were humiliated 7-1 by Germany.

In four games in Qatar so far, Croatia have won only once in 90 minutes – the 4-1 group stage win over Canada either side of goalless draws with Morocco and Belgium, before overcoming Japan on penalties with the score deadlocked at 1-1 after extra time.

Brazil striker Neymar, who marked his return from injury by scoring in Monday’s 4-1 win over South Korea, netted twice when they beat Croatia 3-1 in the group stage in 2014.

Croatia have won all three of their World Cup penalty shootouts. They beat Denmark in the last 16 and hosts Russia in the quarter-finals 2018, and Japan on Monday.

Brazil are unbeaten in their four meetings with Croatia (won 3 drew 1). The teams have met twice in the World Cup, with Brazil winning 1-0 in 2006 and 3-1 as hosts in 2014.



6h ago 04.00 EST Japan’s defeat on penalties to Croatia on Monday was hard for the players to take at the time, but today the Samurai Blue have put out a message thanking fans for their support. They have said to their fans: The connection and unity of all the people who love Japanese football has reached each and every member of the team playing in Qatar and has become a great strength. The team went on to thank everyone involved in grassroots football in Japan, and said that “The Samurai Blue was able to compete against the world’s top powerhouses on the big stage of the Fifa World Cup because of the players, coaches, and staff who have dedicated their lives to football.” The message concludes: Although we were not able to achieve our goal of making it to the quarter-finals this time, we will definitely use this tournament as a source of strength for our dream of winning the Fifa World Cup. We will walk together with all those who love soccer. Japan’s anguish during the penalty shootout defeat to Croatia. Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images



6h ago 03.53 EST AP had reporters out on the streets in Rabat speaking to Morocco fans yesterday as they celebrated their win. “We are so proud of our Lions, who fought hard to get us into the quarter-finals,” said Niama Meddoun, a Rabat resident. “We are delighted to be Moroccans today, since we are the first Arab country that has reached the quarter-finals.” The King of Morocco, Mohammed VI, praised the national team and sent his “heartfelt congratulations” to the players, the technical team and administrative personnel, “who gave their all and blazed a trail throughout this great sporting event,” according to a statement from the royal palace. The king said the players represented “hopes and dreams of Moroccans in Morocco, Qatar, and all over the world.” There were also celebrations in Barcelona. Youssef Lotfi, a 39-year-old construction worker who was born in Casablanca but moved to Spain as a child and said he feels love for both countries, was brimming with pride. “Today is a day of joy for Moroccans and all the Arab world,” Lotfi said. “It was a heart-attack finish that could have gone either way.” He called the victory “once in a lifetime” experience. “Morocco is representing all the Arab world, all the African continent, that is beyond description, it is the most glorious part,” he said.

6h ago 03.36 EST There were some quite punchy quotes from Portugal coach Fernando Santos about CR7 after the game last night. PA carry them, with Santos saying that the role of Cristiano Ronaldo for the remainder of the World Cup is something that has yet to be “defined”. He said: I have a very close relationship with him – I always have, I have known him since he was 19 years old. This relationship only develops, Ronaldo and I never interpret the human aspect of that of manager and player (in relation to) what we have to do during the match. I will always consider in my role that he is an important player to have in the team. Asked directly if Ronaldo would play against Morocco on Saturday, Santos said: “Ronaldo will definitely (be involved), all the players on the bench can be used, if they are not in the starting lineup they can play later. “It is important to look at the example of this player’s history, he is one of the best players in the world at playing professionally, being captain – all we have to do is think about this team collectively.”



7h ago 03.31 EST There are some wonderful pictures this morning on the news wires of the contrasting scenes between Spain and Morocco supporters around the world, which I feel I must start the day by sharing.

44,Gianni Infantino lauds group stage of the Qatar World Cup as ‘best ever’,"Gianni Infantino has hailed the group stage of the Qatar World Cup as the “best ever” and Fifa’s president said the number of upsets and geographic breadth of the teams progressing indicated that football was becoming ever more global.

Argentina, Spain, Germany and Brazil all suffered shock group-stage losses and Africa, Asia and North America were represented in the last 16 along with traditional powerhouses South America and Europe.

Infantino said the matches – “played in beautiful stadiums” – had already attracted a television audience in excess of two billion viewers. “Fantastic atmosphere, great goals, incredible excitement, surprises, small teams beating big teams,” he said in comments released by football’s world governing body.

“Well, there are no more small teams and no more big teams. The level is very, very equal. For the first time as well, national teams from all continents going to the knockout phase, for the first time in history. This shows that football is really becoming truly global.”

Infantino has pushed through the expansion of the World Cup from 32 teams to 48 for the next edition, which will be held across 16 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico in 2026. Fifa was heavily criticised in some quarters for awarding the hosting rights to Qatar because of allegations of corruption and human rights violations.

The governing body’s president rounded on European critics of the host nation in his pre-tournament address, accusing them of hypocrisy and adding that engagement was the only way to improve human rights.

Infantino said he had been delighted with the number of fans crowding into the stadiums and fan zones in the country and thought the final TV viewership figures would exceed five billion. “At the end of the day, we simply want to give some joy and some smiles to people all over the world,” he said.

“That’s what football is about, that’s what the World Cup is about, and that’s what should also happen from now until the end. We have already seen some great action on the field, which is the most important part of what you do.”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/gianni-infantino-hails-group-stage-of-the-qatar-world-cup-as-best-ever,2022-12-07T00:00:00
45,World Cup 2022 briefing: Tantalising quarter-finals lie ahead in Qatar,"Main event

And then there were eight. After four dozen group matches and eight eliminators, Qatar 2022 now has its full complement of quarter-finalists. On Sunday week, the captain of one of the Netherlands, Argentina, France, England, Croatia, Brazil, Morocco or Portugal will triumphantly hoist what is arguably the most iconic trophy in world sport skywards through a deluge of ticker-tape to jubilant roars from his ecstatic teammates, fans and fellow countrymen.

Having long spoken of his desire to win trophies, an ambition that has thus far gone unrealised at Tottenham Hotspur, the honour could fall to Harry Kane, but for now England’s captain is unlikely be looking any further than Saturday’s appointment with France, who are second favourites behind Brazil and could become only the third nation in tournament history to retain the title.

But being favourites means little. On racecourses across the UK, perceived bankers get turned over with monotonous regularity. While the odds-makers called the last 16 largely correctly, a series of matches that suggested several upsets might be on the cards delivered only one.

After a group stage that produced a few seismic shocks and had big name sides such as Germany, Belgium – and to a lesser extent Denmark and Uruguay – crash out, most teams who were expected to advance to the quarter-finals from the first knockout round duly obliged, with Spain the notable exception. Australia, Poland, Switzerland, South Korea, the USA and Senegal can all claim to have left Qatar with their heads held high – Switzerland less so after their thrashing – but there has always been a certain inevitability about the cream of the last 16 crop rising to the top.

In the five World Cup staged previously in this millennium, only South Korea – co-hosts in 2002 – have sent eyebrows soaring in disbelief by advancing to the semi-finals, having first surpassed their own and worldwide expectations by making it to the final eight. With the benefit of home advantage and plenty of luck, Guus Hiddink’s side won no end of admirers as they advanced through the knockout stages at the expense of Italy and Spain before running out of road against Germany. In any other year, the manner in which Turkey made it to the other 2002 semi-final, albeit at the expense of less vaunted opponents, only to lose against Brazil would have been fairly sensational news. In a tournament comparatively full of surprises, the USA also made it to the quarter-finals of South Korea and Japan 2002.

In the four tournaments played since, only Ukraine (2006), Ghana and Paraguay (2010), Costa Rica (2010) and arguably Sweden (2018) have looked to have notions above their stations by making it to the quarter-finals and not one of those surprise packages made it any further, with all eventually going out to more streetwise, often wilier and simply better sides. Despite not being in the top 20 of Fifa’s international rankings, Morocco have bucked the trend in knocking out Spain to take their place in a last eight otherwise full of familiar faces for the first time in their history. Having conceded just one goal – an unlucky own goal – in their past eight games, this obdurate side from north Africa could go even further and will take some beating. BG

Talking points

Hakimi holds nerve for box-office moment

Achraf Hakimi booked Morocco’s place in the quarter-finals with one of the great major-tournament penalties. After playing his part in a magnificent defensive display against Spain, and having already seen his teammate Hakim Ziyech belt his own shootout spot-kick down the middle, the Madrid-born defender dinked the ball into the back of the net with an effort that Andrea Pirlo – or indeed Antonin Panenka – would have been proud of. His celebration was right up there, too, jigging happily on the spot as he awaited the arrival of his on-rushing teammates. Nerveless? No. There were certainly nerves. But after one deep breath, a last moment to focus, Hakimi sent Morocco into the last eight. It was sensational coolness under pressure, and will go down as one of the most memorable moments of a drama-packed tournament. LMc

Ramos seizes moment for rampant Portugal

Gonçalo Ramos’s opening goal flashed past Yann Sommer and into the top corner before Switzerland’s goalkeeper had a chance to move. The Swiss defenders all looked around in disbelief, wondering how they had fallen a goal behind in the blink of an eye. Fabian Schär could have done more to block the shot, and Sommer was beaten at his near post, but the strike was so sweet and powerful it was a moment simply to praise Ramos’s technique and opportunism. By the end of the night, with six goals scored, Portugal had rocketed to somewhere near the top of the rankings of potential tournament winners and Ramos had seized his moment by scoring this World Cup’s first hat-trick. When the Portugal squad massed by the corner flag to celebrate that rocket of an opener, Cristiano Ronaldo was just another face in the crowd. As this rate he will need to get used to it. LMc

There were troubling scenes outside the Education City Stadium before and during the Morocco v Spain match, with fans of the African nation unable to gain entry for the last-16 tie. Journalists reported that there was the risk of a crush when the stadium entrance was closed midway inside the first half and a flashpoint when an officer fell off a horse amid chaotic scenes near a chainlink fence. Fans said by organisers to be ticketless tried to get past a security cordon but were pushed back by police and security forces. It was reported that the situation calmed down when many fans outside chose to watch on their mobile phones. GB

Global media-watch

The exits of both Japan and South Korea in quick succession left Asia without a representative in the World Cup’s last eight, but press reaction domestically has mostly viewed the defeats through the prism that reaching the last 16 was an achievement in itself.

In the Hankyoreh in South Korea, there was a lament for the pressure the schedule had put the team under compared to Brazil. “The World Cup was held while the European leagues were in progress, affecting the duration of the tournament,” the newspaper said. “The Korean players, who had no choice but to put up with the tight schedule, suffered from physical exhaustion. Brazil changed most of the starting lineup in the third round of the group stage.”

The Kyunghyang Shinmun had reporters on the streets of Seoul where fans gathered to watch at 4am in temperatures of -4C. “Citizens who filled the plaza three hours before the start of the game melted the cold with cup noodles and hot coffee,” it noted, adding: “It snowed quite a bit from the end of the first half, but the enthusiasm for cheering was not dampened.” There was no indication on whether there was a noodle shower when South Korea scored.

The Japan Times said that after the wins over Spain and Germany, “the international soccer community should be taking note of how this Japan side isn’t another flash in the pan”. Dan Orlowitz reckoned: “Over four games at this tournament, the Samurai Blue’s performances showcased some of their greatest strengths – and exposed their most glaring weaknesses,” and said: “It’s now hoped that Monday’s heartbreak will drive many of the 19 players at their first World Cup to bring the team to the promised land of the quarter-finals and beyond.” MB

The internet reacts

Roy Keane continued his quest to make friends all over the world with his disparaging remarks about Brazil’s dance celebrations on Monday. TNT Sports BR were not the only people to compare Keane’s remarks that the dancing was “disrespectful” to his own actions during his career, but with over five million followers on Twitter their flashback to that Keane tackle on Alfe Inge Haaland will have had more reach than most.

Roy Keane achou ""desrespeitoso"" as danças que jogadores brasileiros fizeram após os gols contra a Coreia.

(+) 🧶 pic.twitter.com/0cWysDHSF0 — TNT Sports BR (@TNTSportsBR) December 6, 2022

Not everybody quite hit the mark. One outraged tweet suggested that Keane had been born into a society where people don’t dance because they don’t know how to express themselves. Quite a difficult take on Irish culture to explain to Michael Flatley, one imagines.

Still, at least one bunch of internet killjoys were impressed. The self-styled official celebration police of the World Cup have promoted Keane to an honorary role as chief constable, complete with a lovely British police hat. Keane will surely love that. MB

And finally …

Olivier Giroud impressed in his France press conference by switching between English, French and Italian to answer a variety of questions on subjects ranging from his thoughts on Harry Kane and Didier Deschamps’ tactics to what he made of the mocked-up images of his and Kylian Mbappé’s bromantic on-pitch embrace in the 3-1 win against Poland. “There is nothing calculated about the photo, it was a really nice photo and the Photoshops have made me laugh. Sport makes us live amazing things and it wasn’t a winning goal in a final but it was important,” he said, in case you’re wondering. After half an hour of holding court, remaining cheery and unruffled, perhaps there is a job as a press officer for the striker when he hangs up his boots.

Their first-half evisceration of South Korea felt like a throwback, moments such as Richarlison’s seal impression offering reminders of those days when nobody could rival Brazil for sheer fun. Even without Gabriel Jesus they retain a depth of attacking talent few can match, partly thanks to Neymar’s Lazarus-like recovery from injury. Keep this up and a first World Cup since 2002 should be theirs, although there are caveats: they squeaked past Switzerland, the only practised tournament side they have faced, and Croatia should offer an even sterner test on Friday. Alisson Becker was also worked harder than he may have liked on Monday night, although he demonstrated the value of a top-class keeper in the process. Can anyone stop them?

Sometimes it feels France’s plan is to send possession Kylian Mbappé’s way and say: “You do the rest.” The problem for their opponents is that it tends to work. Anyone who can halt Mbappé may be able to stop Les Bleus but he is in virtually unplayable form and already looks a safe bet for the Golden Boot. Didier Deschamps will also be encouraged that the supporting cast is showing signs of life and France, who have scored nine goals across the three games in which he has selected a first-choice side, may be clicking at the right time. The evergreen Olivier Giroud adds a valuable balance while Aurélien Tchouaméni has taken to life as their midfield linchpin. Further injuries would give Deschamps a headache but the core look in lean shape.

That wasn’t so difficult, was it? Now that Fernando Santos has, perhaps terminally, cut the cord with Cristiano Ronaldo the tournament seems alive with possibility for Portugal. They were devastating against Switzerland, a rejuvenated frontline slicing their unusually loose opponents open at will and Gonçalo Ramos coming from nowhere to become a potential star of this winter. Beating decent Ghana and Uruguay sides in the group stage was further evidence of the weapons Santos has in his armoury, which include a potent substitute in Rafael Leão. They will not be devastated at facing Morocco on Saturday, who spent 120 minutes on a highly rewarding but hugely exacting task in defeating Spain. Could Ronaldo’s much-sought World Cup be won from the sidelines?

Gareth Southgate’s players will find France a clear step up from several lower-key assignments but it would not take an over-active imagination to see them pull through on Saturday. There were rocky moments early on against Senegal but England have some of the best young players in the tournament – Jude Bellingham has announced himself as an essential pick – and are a gripping proposition when on the front foot. When they are denied space, much of their possession can appear sterile: France will know that and may be content to utilise their own speed through counterattacks. But Harry Kane has opened his account, the midfield looks well-balanced and defensive bloopers have been minimised: could it be coming home for Christmas?

Every Argentina match in Doha feels like appointment viewing, if not for the fare produced by Lionel Scaloni’s team then for the jaw-dropping support that turns stadiums into pulsating places of worship. La Albiceleste have only shone in flashes but have done well to banish that remarkable defeat by Saudi Arabia, and one thing is clear: Lionel Messi is already enjoying his best World Cup, scoring three times and operating on a different level to everyone else. There are signs his younger teammates are raising theirs: Julián Álvarez is showing why Manchester City brought him to the Etihad and the Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernández looks an outstanding talent. They still need to put it together against the best but with supporters that make it feel like they have home advantage, Argentina have a chance.

There is a sense Louis van Gaal’s team has flown beneath the radar so far but, like others, they are stirring at a convenient point. Critics accused them of boring football during an unremarkable group stage but Memphis Depay and Cody Gakpo – the latter was certainly exempt from criticism in earlier games – shone against the USA and Denzel Dumfries was outstanding at right wing-back. Frenkie de Jong was also back to his best and their tie with Argentina, a reprise of previous classics, looks finely poised. The Netherlands are unbeaten in 19 games since Van Gaal’s return and, while he would still like greater control in possession, can be rapier-like in the transition. If Messi is to land the biggest prize, he has a stiff hurdle to overcome on Friday.

Morocco showed in the group stage that they are a serious team and everyone is awake to that now after they dumped Spain out. Walid Regragui oversees a tough, clever unit with extraordinary tactical discipline and an attack capable of the unexpected. The only goal they have conceded was a consolation in the win over Canada and that is some achievement given they have played Croatia, Belgium and Spain. Shutting out Portugal on Saturday would top the lot and Morocco have a chance. In Achraf Hakimi they possess a genuine star, while Luis Enrique can testify to the qualities of the midfield whirlwind, Azzedine Ounahi. And nobody can discount a flash of genius from Hakim Ziyech. Africa has never had a representative in the last four and Morocco are a win away from making history.

You know the old saying: never write off the Croatians. In all seriousness, Zlatko Dalic’s team have a whiff of past Germany sides about them: they never know when they are beaten and, while they are creaking in some departments, few know their way around a tournament more adeptly. They were on the ropes against a sparky Japan but pulled through; Ivan Perisic’s equaliser was a reminder that half this squad still boasts several World Cup finalists and that counts for plenty when fine margins need navigating. Whether they can handle Brazil’s attacking tempo remains to be seen but it would be foolhardy to rule them out on Friday. One way or another, Croatia have a habit of making you play on their terms.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar,2022-12-07T00:00:00
48,Gonçalo Ramos’s treble marks him out as Portugal’s present and future,"We should probably start by discussing the notable absentee from Tuesday’s World Cup last-16 game. Specifically, Switzerland. Granted, the Swiss would make their belated entrance in the second half, a cameo appearance to console the thousands of fans who had come to support them. But the result was no longer in doubt, and ultimately their presence was largely inconsequential. A reminder, if any were needed, that in this rarefied air those who are not prepared to put in a defensive shift quickly dissolve into irrelevance.

But of course there was a genuine star here too, and he was playing up front for Portugal. Gonçalo Ramos is 21 years old, comes from the Algarve and had not played international football until last month. He left Lusail with his life changed forever: a hat-trick and an assist, accomplished with the irrepressible confidence of a young man convinced the stage is his to own.

This was perhaps the most arresting thing about Ramos here. There were no histrionics, no wide-eyed expressions of disbelief, nothing that betrayed the magnitude of this occasion or any flicker of doubt. He was a surprise call-up by Fernando Santos; perhaps even a speculative pick, one to bring along for the learning experience. But there can be little doubt now that Ramos is not just the future of this Portugal team, but its present.

Ramos plays for Benfica, currently eight points clear of the Primeira Liga under Roger Schmidt, and what really sets him apart is his movement. He weaves left and right, sniffs out the space, keeps defenders guessing with quick changes of direction and sudden bursts of pace. He has a poacher’s instinct, a beast of a shot and a bullet header. And yet last season he often played as an understudy to Darwin Núñez, dropping deep to create space for the main man.

Núñez signed for Liverpool this summer. All of a sudden Ramos was the main man. Now entrusted with leading the line, the position he likes best, he already has 14 goals for Benfica this season and arrived in the Middle East on a wave of good tidings. Here he took his place at the vanguard of a daringly aggressive lineup: five attacking players and only one genuine holding midfielder in William Carvalho. In addition left-back Raphaël Guerreiro charged forward at every opportunity, at times the furthest player up the pitch, finishing off a terrifying breakaway to put Portugal 4-0 up.

In a way, you wondered whether this was Portugal as Santos has always envisaged them: a young and hungry team playing a lightning attacking game. But this is not the sort of football you can play unless all your players do their jobs at all times. It is not a system built to carry passengers. If your centre-forward is not pressuring the goalkeeper and cutting off the passing angles into midfield, then you will simply get cut open. If one of your front five is not mobile or selfless enough to make decoy runs and drag defenders out of position, then your attacks will end up looking very similar.

But with Ramos as the spearhead, Portugal looked a totally different prospect. His first goal was the key here: João Félix playing it into him, Fabian Schär showing him outside, reasoning that a rookie striker was not going to score his first World Cup goal by smashing it in at the near post from an impossible angle. Which is exactly what Ramos did. He topped it off with his trademark smoking gun celebration, and somehow that moment seemed to move the envelope of possibility for Portugal, convince them of a brighter future.

The veteran Pepe – a man who made his professional debut in the year Mark Hughes retired – scored their second with a ridiculous leap, a reminder that age is no barrier to a place in this side. But Ramos would not be kept quiet for long. He tucked in Diogo Dalot’s cross with a sharp diagonal run to the near post and would later complete his hat-trick with a delightful burst of pace and a dainty chip over Yann Sommer.

This is simply the way of things: the leaves fall in autumn and grow again in spring, players get old and new players come through. Finally, with a few minutes remaining Portugal brought on their big man in an attempt to get him a confidence-boosting goal. And Rafael Leão obliged: cutting inside and curling the ball delightfully into the far corner. With Ricardo Horta also making a late cameo, and typically assured displays from Otávio and Bernardo Silva, Santos now has something of a dilemma in the attacking positions.

And make no mistake: this was a performance to put the rest of the tournament on notice. Morocco in the next round should put up more of a fight than Switzerland, although Portugal may well be the fresher side, having essentially got the job done within one hour instead of two. There is a long road ahead. Santos has some devilishly tough calls to make. But with the remarkable Ramos at the helm, this is a team that finally feels complete.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/06/goncalo-ramoss-display-marks-him-out-as-portugals-present-and-future,2022-12-06T00:00:00
49,"Ramos, Ronaldo and a very public and brutal World Cup humiliation","WITH OR WITHOUT HIM?

Yes, yes … we’ll get to Him. Of course we will because even when his involvement is increasingly, almost comically peripheral, everything ultimately ends up being about Him. But first a nod to the players and supporters of Morocco, to whom Tuesday really belonged. Following the north African side’s win against the throwback tiki-taka scamperers of Spain (possession: 77%, passes: 1,019, goals: 0), scarcely a U2 pun went unpunished as shootout hero Bono and chums celebrated a dogged, obdurate and thoroughly deserved victory.

On a truly Beautiful Day for Moroccan football, it was One in which their fans in Qatar, at home and elsewhere took understandably immense Pride. Scarcely a car horn went unparped on the streets of Casablanca by fans who will be hoping their team, who have conceded just one goal – an own goal – in their past eight matches can play it again in such fine style against Portugal, whose impressive demolition job on the Switzerland has been predictably overshadowed by the most conspicuous absence of the name “Ronaldo” from an official team sheet since the temporary omission of a certain Brazilian prior to the final in 1998.

While it has since emerged that the Brazilian Ronaldo was ill and almost certainly should have sat that game out, his Portuguese namesake has been suffering from nothing more serious than an inflated sense of self-regard, a form of pyromania that has led him to incinerate a couple of big bridges in under a month. No longer the footballing force he once was, Cristiano Ronaldo remains an intimidating presence on the pitch but for some time now it has looked like it is only his own teammates, rather than opponents, who are cowed by him. “I’m quite surprised but not overly shocked,” said the great Ally McCoist on ITV. “Having said that, I must say I am slightly shocked, of that there is no doubt.” Not for the first time in this tournament, Coisty succinctly captured the global mood in a nutshell.

While Fernando Santos’s decision to bench his show pony in favour of starting the young Benfica striker Gonçalo Ramos was a Big Call, it quickly proved the right one. Within 17 minutes the fresh-faced 21-year-old had passed Ronaldo’s career tally of zero World Cup knockout stage goals and missed a couple of presentable chances but finished the game with this tournament’s first hat-trick. And while the man he replaced joined in the goal celebrations before helping to close out the game ahead of an abrupt post-match scuttle down the tunnel, we can but guess what he made of what was ultimately a very public and brutal humiliation.

“We wanted a team that played with a lot of fluidity,” said Santos, when asked about his decision to drop Ronaldo, among other big but not quite so stellar names. “Cristiano is more fixed, he stays in a more determined role towards the box. Gonçalo has different characteristics: he is very dynamic and that’s what he ended up showing us.” With Morocco to come, Ramos seems to have made himself undroppable, while on the other hand his forlorn and beleaguered captain increasingly seems unpickable.

In response to Steve Marron’s request for a pub recommendation in Cambridge (Tuesday’s Football Daily letters), I can do no better than pass on one I received from this parish’s very own Max Rushden 12 years ago. I was with a few friends in Puerto Escondido in Mexico when we celeb-spotted our Max, who was an absolute delight. We were living in Cambridge at the time, and Max, being a local, was keen to send our custom to the Salisbury Arms, not far from the station. Great beers (not just for those in the royal boxes) and artisan pizzas. Don’t thank me, thank Max” – Theo B-P.

As a Cambridge resident, may I suggest the Free Press or the Panton Arms (five and 10 minutes out of the centre, respectively). Or the Elm Tree (the Hobbit pub) and The Champion of the Thames if they just want beer. ‘Proper’ pubs, all. In the centre of town, though, especially for USA! USA!! USA!!! visitors, it has to be The Eagle on Bene’t Street with its famous ceiling, covered in burnt-in names and messages from airmen stationed nearby during the second world war. It’s fascinating, very moving – and the food’s pretty good” – Steve Bennett.

Kudos to Spain manager Luis Enrique for inspiring dreamy middle-aged male football fans everywhere by bringing on substitutes Balde and Fati in the 97th minute in a bid to break down the sturdy Moroccans” – David Collins.

Spain v Morocco may have been too close to call but there really is a gulf in class between a Ronaldo-less Portugal and the Africans – the Gulf of Cádiz – Nick Smith.

51,‘Immense joy’: Moroccan media hails good faith paying off with Spain shock,"“La Roja ejected, Regragui’s Lions are definite legends,” read the headline in Le Matin, while L’Opinion spoke of a night of “immense joy in the streets of Rabat”, both Morocco-based newspapers perfectly summing up the country’s stunning victory over Spain in the last-16 of the World Cup.

As was the case in the group stages, Morocco’s defensive line held firm on Tuesday and ultimately the fixture against the 2010 world champions at Education City Stadium became an intriguing and enthralling chess match between the head coaches, Luis Enrique and Walid Regragui. The latter ended the day victorious, taking the Atlas Lions to the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time, a feat greeted with emphatically enthusiastic and congratulatory media reaction.

“Regragui and the Lions have trained the Spanish Toro,” said ElBotola.com, while Hespress.com singled out Morocco’s goalkeeper, Yassine Bounou, describing him as “the one who broke the tactic of a thousand penalty kicks” in reference to Luis Enrique’s words about the need necessity for every Spanish player to have practised “at least 1,000 penalties” before joining La Roja’s squad in Doha.

Le360.ma, meanwhile, tracked the movements of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation president, Fouzi Lekjaa, as he watched on at Education City, noting that he had kicked every ball and reacted to every game phase. He celebrated victory by embracing his neighbouring spectator, Patrice Motsepe, the Confederation of African Football president.

The US-based MoroccoWorldNews.com reported on how “some fans chose to celebrate the Atlas Lions by beeping car horns, while others were shouting ‘Morocco’ through their windows and balconies to share their excitement”. There were also tales of King Mohammed VI leading celebrations in the streets of Rabat, wearing a national team jersey and waving to passers-by through his car’s window. “King Mohammed VI held a phone call with Fouzi Lekjaa and head coach Walid Regragui, expressing his sincere congratulations to the national team and technical staff.”

Make no mistake, the game inspired a level of joy that Moroccans have not felt for a long time. But it is also a joy that came after plenty of sacrifices and suffering. Le Matin quoted the midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, who endured back pain the entire night before the game. “I was up until three in the morning with the physiologist. I didn’t know if I was going to play,” he said. “I just knew I couldn’t let the boys and my country down.” This was also a success forged in humility, summed up by Bounou’s reaction after he had been awarded the man of the match trophy. “The penalties, it’s a bit of intuition, a bit of luck,” the Sevilla goalkeeper was quoted as saying by the Casablanca-based newspaper. “We won and that’s the most important.”

Perhaps the most memorable quote from Morocco’s entire World Cup campaign has come from Regragui. Before playing Belgium in the group stages, the head coach asked for “national unity”, asking all Moroccans to have “niya” (good faith). “The energy plays a role in football,” he said. “When people are in good faith, the ball will hit the bar and enter. And vice versa, if some are saying: ‘Look at this avocado head, he talks too much,’ and show bad faith, the ball would hit the bar and go out.”

The message has been widely shared on social media and, on Tuesday, was attached to images of Pablo Sarabia’s last-gasp chance for Spain that hit the post and deflected out. Good faith, indeed.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/morocco-media-hails-spain-shock-world-cup-qatar-2022,2022-12-07T00:00:00
52,Morocco fans drum out Spain to keep Africa dreaming and draw Doha as one,"A few minutes after Yassine Bounou’s penalty shootout heroics, Morocco’s players knelt in unison to pray before a baying bank of supporters drumming furiously to the sweet sound of victory against Spain. It was a powerful sight that will touch more than the tens of thousands of Moroccans here.

After more than 130 minutes of gripping drama and relentless noise, Morocco are the lone Arab nation and last African team standing. The Argentinian referee, Fernando Rapallini, needed a megaphone to make himself heard.

Bounou, the Morocco goalkeeper who saved from Carlos Soler and Sergio Busquets and is one of four Morocco players based in Spain, was still getting his breath back after being tossed into the air by his teammates. Bounou – who has “Bono” on his shirt – and the forward Youssef En-Nesyri play in La Liga for Sevilla and the substitute Abdessamad Ezzalzouli, who was raised in Spain from the age of seven, for Osasuna.

Then it was the turn of the manager, Walid Regragui, to be hoisted aloft by his players. Regragui, who agreed to take charge only in August, kept tapping his head with both hands while on the run to join the party, as if to say: is this really happening? Morocco are only the fourth African team to reach the World Cup quarter-finals and the first since Ghana in 2010.

Before the game Moroccans – with the help of a few Cameroonian, Ghanaian, Senegalese and Tunisian supporters determined to unite for their continent – had turned Souq Waqif into a postcard of Marrakech. The extra 5,000 tickets released by the Moroccan federation on Sunday in an attempt to satisfy demand proved inadequate.

A partisan crowd enjoyed themselves – some spent almost the entire match with their backs to the pitch in favour of creating a din – but outside the stadium some supporters clashed with riot police. Some resorted to huddling around a mobile phone to watch the action. They need not require any sound, for the reality was loud and clear. Those lucky enough to be inside more than got their money’s worth and, in truth, they probably could have been blindfolded and still told you exactly what was happening.

The fourth meeting between these teams was always going to blur loyalties given their geopolitical relationship. Only the strait of Gibraltar, eight miles at its narrowest point, separates the countries and Ceuta and Melilla have been Spanish exclaves in north Africa since 1580 and 1497 respectively. It was fitting, then, that Achraf Hakimi, who was born in Madrid, took the decisive spot‑kick, chipping the ball down the middle of goal as Unai Simón dived to his right.

Morocco’s players and substitutes streaked after Hakimi. Hakimi, who plays for Paris Saint‑Germain, a club under Qatari ownership, is something of a cover star in Doha’s downtown, on PSG branding in the Msheireb district. Tears streamed down the cheeks of a Morocco supporter, his face-paint running off him.

From the moment a montage of Spain’s passage to the last 16 appeared on the big screens, the tone was set. When the team was read aloud, the Morocco supporters jeered every name. During the Moroccan national anthem Hakimi closed his eyes as if dreaming. As soon as Spain played the ball back to Aymeric Laporte at kick-off, a familiar theme was established. The Morocco supporters shrilled, squealed and whistled for as long as Spain had possession. And boy did they have some possession. Spain completed almost four times as many passes as Morocco. Laporte and Rodri had twice the number of touches of any Morocco player. Morocco’s fans made just about any noise they could in an attempt to destabilise Spain and it seemed to work. Marco Asensio registered Spain’s first shot after almost 26 minutes, their only attempt in the first half.

Spain seemingly planned on causing death by a thousand passes – 1,050 if we are being precise – but Morocco, sitting deep, often with 11 men behind the ball, stuck to the task and their defending was befitting of their nickname: the Atlas Lions. Sofyan Amrabat was everywhere and Sofiane Boufal bright before being replaced.

At times their desire got the better of them, though. Yahia Attiyat Allah accidentally tripped Ezzalzouli in his desperation to steal the ball, but moments later the pair teamed up to block Marcos Llorente’s cross. Morocco’s captain, Romain Saïss, pulled a hamstring in extra‑time but returned to the field partially mummified, his left leg taped up by medical staff. They then survived the substitute Pablo Sarabia’s volley kissing a post deep into three minutes of stoppage time at the end of extra-time.

The scenes were joyous. The final stop on Morocco’s victory lap was to celebrate before their biggest group of supporters, behind their dugout.

It was there where their close relatives, who have been permitted to stay at their plush Doha base, rejoiced. For Morocco, this is a family affair – extended family affair, perhaps, given how many people across the world were backing them here. Among the guests at their West Bay hotel are the midfielder Abdelhamid Sabiri’s parents and Regragui’s mother, Fatima, who until now had never left Paris, let alone France, to follow her son. She will not forget this trip in a hurry.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/dec/06/morocco-fans-drum-out-spain-to-keep-africa-dreaming-and-draw-doha-as-one,2022-12-06T00:00:00
53,A short history of World Cup hat-tricks: from Patenaude to Ramos,"Gonçalo Ramos received immediate, global acclaim when he scored the first hat-trick of the World Cup in Qatar. Having replaced Cristiano Ronaldo in the Portugal starting lineup, the 21-year-old had already caused quite a stir and the eyes of the world were trained on the Benfica striker against Switzerland. He joined an illustrious list of players to have scored on their full World Cup debut, which started with the Argentina striker Guillermo Stabile, who achieved the feat in the inaugural tournament in 1930, up to Miroslav Klose in 2002, the most recent to do so before Ramos’s treble.

The honour of scoring the first hat-trick at a World Cup finals should be a treasured memory and the pinnacle of a footballer’s career. Unfortunately for Bert Patenaude, it did not work out that way. In the first World Cup in 1930, USA faced Paraguay in a group match. Patenaude opened the scoring for USA in the 10th minute and swiftly added a second five minutes later. The centre-forward scored a third just after half-time and his claim to the match ball seemed to be complete.

However, there was a twist. Fifa officials credited his second goal to his teammate Tom Florie while others listed it as an own goal, denying Patenaude his moment of glory. There was little support from the American press as they barely covered their team’s progress to the semi-finals and the absence of any televised evidence added a further layer of obfuscation. Two days later, on his international debut, Stabile scored his own treble for Argentina in a 6-3 win over Mexico and that became the official, original World Cup hat-trick.

Even by the fairly pedestrian and arcane standards of football authorities, the resolution was a long time coming. It was not until 2006 that the issue was finally settled when Fifa acknowledged the legitimacy of Patenaude’s treble. It took more than a decade of lobbying by Colin Jose, an American football historian, to provide the evidence to confirm the hat-trick. Jose took up Patenaude’s case in the 1990s as he started to conduct his own research among surviving members of the USA team. Unfortunately Patenaude was not alive to enjoy the official affirmation of his achievement, as he died in 1974 at the age 65, but at least he is now enshrined in the record books for perpetuity.

Not only was his the first World Cup hat-trick but it was also only one scored by a player from the United States. In total, there have been 53 hat-tricks in the 22 World Cup tournaments. Germany have the most with seven, well clear of the next most prolific countries, Argentina and Hungary, who have four each. Six different Germans have scored hat-tricks from Edmund Conen’s quickfire treble in the space of 21 minutes against Belgium in 1934 through to Thomas Müller’s against Portugal in 2014.

Gerd Müller, who Brian Glanville described as “that astonishing opportunist”, is one of only four players to have scored more than one World Cup hat-trick and he achieved his feat in consecutive matches in the 1970 tournament. On 7 June he scored three of West Germany’s five goals against Bulgaria, and then repeated the trick in a 3-0 win over Peru three days later. Müller is not the only player to have scored two hat-tricks in the space of three days; the Hungary striker Sandor Kocsis had done the same thing 16 years earlier. The Hungarian went one better: after scoring three in the 9-0 demolition of South Korea on 17 June 1954, he scored four in an 8-3 victory over West Germany on 20 June. A few weeks later, though, West Germany had their revenge, when they overcame Hungary 3-2 in the final.

Four years after Kocsis’s pair of hat-tricks, Just Fontaine scored two hat-tricks at the World Cup in Sweden while setting the record for the most goals at a tournament with 13. Fontaine scored his first hat-trick in France’s opening match, against Paraguay, and his second in France’s last match of the tournament, rattling in four against West Germany in the third-place playoff.

Of the four players with multiple World Cup hat-tricks, Gabriel Batistuta is the only one who has done it across two tournaments. The Argentina forward scored his first on 21 June 1994 against Greece and, exactly four years later, he hit his second treble against Jamaica at the Parc des Princes. By scoring his second hat-trick in the space of 10 minutes, Batistuta recorded the second quickest in World Cup history.

The quickest came in Hungary’s 10-1 demolition of El Salvador in 1982, when it took Laszlo Kiss seven minutes to score three goals. Having come on as a substitute in the 55th minute after Hungary’s fifth goal, Kiss scored his first in the 69th minute, his second in the 72nd minute and completed his quickfire hat-trick in the 76th minute. He remains the only substitute to have scored a hat-trick at the World Cup.

Of the 956 matches at World Cups, only three have featured two hat-tricks – and two of them were at the 1938 tournament. The first was Poland’s debut game, which ended in a 6-5 loss to Brazil, for whom Leonidas scored three. The unfortunate Ernest Wilimowski marked his country’s first ever match at the World Cup finals with four goals, but still ended up on the losing side. The second match with multiple hat-tricks was a more one-sided affair, with Sweden beating Cuba 8-0 in the quarter-finals, courtesy of two hat-tricks from Gustav Wetterstrom and Harry Andersson.

The third match to feature two hat-tricks came in the 1954 tournament in Switzerland, which was blessed with a cavalcade of goals. There were 140 scored in 26 matches at an average 5.4 per game, the highest of any World Cup. Unsurprisingly 1954 set the record for the most hat-tricks in a single tournament. There were eight in total. In the quarter-final between Switzerland and Austria, the record for the highest aggregate score in a match was set when the hosts lost 7-5. Theodor Wagner scored three for the victors, while Switzerland forwardJosef Hügi became the second player in history to score a hat-trick and end up on the losing side.

Four players went to Qatar having already scored World Cup hat-tricks: Harry Kane, Müller, Ronaldo and Xherdan Shaqiri. Ramos’s treble against Switzerland means he joins Kane and the man he replaced in the Portugal team as the only players left in the tournament with trebles to their name. If any of them scores another in Qatar they will not have to wait as long as Patenaude did to have their place in World Cup history confirmed.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-hat-tricks-history-patenaude-ramos-batistuta-muller-cristiano-ronaldo,2022-12-07T00:00:00

55,‘I’ll miss you’: Belgium’s Eden Hazard retires from international football,"Eden Hazard has announced his international retirement in the wake of Belgium’s group stage exit from the World Cup in Qatar.

The 31-year-old revealed the decision on his social media account less than a week after his side were eliminated following a goalless draw with Croatia.



Hazard, who made his Belgium debut as a 17-year-old in 2008, wrote: “A page turns today... thank you for your love. Thank you for your unparalleled support. Thank you for all this happiness shared since 2008. I have decided to put an end to my international career. The succession is ready. I will miss you”.

The Real Madrid winger earned 126 international caps, scoring 33 goals and captaining his country 56 times. However, he played in a minor role during the World Cup campaign, coming on for the final three minutes in the match against the Croats.

Hazard made 245 appearances for Chelsea between 2012 and 2019, helping the Stamford Bridge club to two Premier League titles and two Europa League wins.

His Belgium team-mate Kevin De Bruyne tweeted: “What a journey it has been. Congratulations, Capi. You’ll be missed!”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/belgium-eden-hazard-retires-from-international-football-real-madrid,2022-12-07T00:00:00
56,Which player has scored the most goals in World Cup knockout games?,"“Lionel Messi finally notched his first goal in a World Cup knockout game on Saturday,” writes Andy Bailey. “This made me wonder: who has scored the most in knockout matches?”

This isn’t the easiest question to answer because of the different ways the World Cup has been structured over the years. In 1934 and 1938, there were nothing but knockout games (albeit with only 16 teams). In 1950, and then from 1974-82, there was a second group stage which replaced some of the knockout rounds. For example, in 1982, Paolo Rossi scored a hat-trick in Italy’s legendary 3-2 win over Brazil – a de facto quarter-final, but not technically a knockout game.

For the purposes of this question we’ve only included matches that were knockout fixtures in name and nature. That also means excluding the third-placed playoff, as it’s usually a glorified friendly.

The list is dominated – who knew – by Brazilians, with the original Ronaldo top of the pops. He scored 15 goals at the World Cup, second only to Germany’s Miroslav Klose, and more than half of them were in knockout games. In 1998 he hit two against Chile in the last 16 and then put Brazil ahead in their thrilling semi-final against the Netherlands.

Four years later, in one of the great comeback stories, he helped see off Belgium in the last 16, then scored the only goal against Turkey in the semi-final and the only goals against Germany in the final. His last knockout punch came in Germany in 2006, when he beat the Ghana keeper Richard Kingson with a delicious stepover.

That goal puts Ronaldo one ahead of two other Brazilians, Pelé and Vavá – who both scored three of their seven knockout goals in World Cup finals – as well as the Czech forward Oldrich Nejedly. Nejedly played nothing but knockout games at the World Cup, six of them in total. He scored five times in 1934, including a hat-trick to beat Germany in the semi-final, and two in 1938.

Ronaldo might soon be overtaken by Kylian Mbappé, whose pair of screamers against Poland were his fourth and fifth at the business end of the competition.

Here’s the full list of those with at least five goals in World Cup knockout ties:

8 goals: Ronaldo (Brazil, 1998-2006).

7: Oldrich Nejedly (Czechoslovakia, 1934-38), Pelé (Brazil, 1958-70), Vavá (Brazil, 1958-62).

6: Leônidas (Brazil, 1934-38; +2 in third-place playoff), Gary Lineker (England, 1986-90), Gyorgy Sarosi (Hungary, 1934-38).

5: Roberto Baggio (Italy, 1990-98; +1 in third-place playoff), Eusébio (Portugal, 1966; +1 in third-place playoff), Miroslav Klose (Germany, 2002-14), Kylian Mbappé (France, 2018-22), Silvio Piola (Italy, 1938), Wesley Sneijder (Netherlands, 2006-14), Zinedine Zidane (France, 1998-2006), Gyula Zsengeller (Hungary, 1938).

NB: had we included goals in the second group stage, and we’re still umming and ahhing over it, four other players would have made the list: Paolo Rossi (Italy, 1978-82) with 7 and Ademir (Brazil, 1950), Mario Kempes (Argentina, 1974-82) and Gerd Müller (West Germany, 1970-74) all with 6.

Selected others:

4: Garrincha (Brazil, 1958-66), Geoff Hurst (England, 1966-70), Diego Maradona (Argentina, 1982-94), Gerd Müller (West Germany, 1970-74; +2 in second group stage).

3: Franz Beckenbauer (West Germany, 1966-74), Just Fontaine (France, 1958; +4 in third-place playoff), Michel Platini (France, 1978-86), Paolo Rossi (Italy, 1978-82; +4 in second group stage).

2: Gabriel Batistuta (Argentina, 1994-2002), Bobby Charlton (England, 1962-70), Harry Kane (England, 2018-22), Mario Kempes (Argentina, 1974-82; +4 in second group stage), Romário (Brazil, 1990-94).

1: Thierry Henry (France, 1998-2010), Lionel Messi (Argentina, 2006-22), Ferenc Puskás (Hungary, 1954, Spain, 1962).

0: Johan Cruyff (Netherlands, 1974; +3 in second group stage), Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal, 2006-22), Marco van Basten (Netherlands, 1990).

Big wins, little reward

“Spain almost failed to qualify for the knockout rounds despite beating Costa Rica 7-0,” notes Emily Bartram. “Has any team had such a big victory in their opening game yet failed to get out of the group?”

They have indeed. Hungary started the 1982 World Cup by famously trouncing El Salvador 10-1, but the next two matches were an uncomfortable step up in class. They were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina and then, in a game they had to win to make their goal difference count, drew 1-1 with Belgium. Hungary finished on three points (two for a win in those days), one behind Argentina and two behind Belgium.

In the same tournament, Scotland started with a 5-2 win over New Zealand before losing 4-1 to Brazil and drawing 2-2 with the Soviet Union. That’s the second-biggest victory in the opening game by a team that was eliminated in the group stages.

Ecuador, Belgium and Saudi Arabia were all eliminated despite winning their opening games in Qatar. But the last example of a team starting with a handsome victory – let’s say by three goals or more – and still failing to go through was in 2006. The Czech Republic looked the part in dismantling the USA 3-0, but they were well beaten by Ghana and Italy in their subsequent matches.

At the 1970 tournament, Belgium beat El Salvador 3-0 in their first match, but then lost to the Soviet Union and the hosts Mexico.

In total, seven sides have gone out after taking four points (or three when it was two for a win) from their first two matches.

1974 Italy, Scotland

2002 Cameroon, Costa Rica

2006 South Korea

2010 Slovenia

2022 Ecuador

This being a tale of group-stage misery, Scotland probably have the best yarn. In 1974 they beat Zaire 2-0 before drawing 0-0 with the champions Brazil. But their relatively modest win over Zaire (who lost 9-0 to Yugoslavia and 3-0 to Brazil) meant they had to win their final game against Yugoslavia to avoid going out on goal difference. Scotland drew 1-1 and had the irritating distinction of being the only unbeaten team in the entire tournament.

A couple of teams, Chile in 1930 and Yugoslavia in 1950, were eliminated in the first group stage despite winning their first two games, though that’s not as unlikely as it sounds: on both occasions only the top team went through. A more famous example came later in the 1950 tournament, which was decided by a second four-team group. The hosts Brazil looked irresistible in beating Sweden 7-1 and Spain 6-1, only to lose 2-1 to Uruguay in one of the most dramatic games in football history.

Last, but at least …

“Japan have won Group E, despite losing to Costa Rica, who finished bottom of group E. Has this happened before in a four-team World Cup group?” asks Mark Holt.

It actually occurred 24 hours earlier, when Argentina won Group C and Saudi Arabia finished bottom. In the era of four-team groups it has been pretty rare for the winners to lose to anyone, never mind the team finishing bottom, but it has happened on a few other occasions. Four, to be precise, with Cameroon’s dead rubber (for them) defeat to the Soviet Union in 1990 the most eye-catching. They are:

1990 Cameroon 0-4 Soviet Union (Group B)

1994 Mexico 0-1 Norway (Group E)

2010 Germany 0-1 Serbia (Group D)

2018 Sweden 1-2 Germany (Group F)

Hello, goodbye

“When was the last time that neither team from a World Cup opening match qualified for the following round?” asks Matt Reilly.

Somewhere in the distant past, Qatar lost 2-0 to Ecuador in the first game of the 2022 tournament, and neither team was able to get out of Group A. To find the last time this happened, you have to go back to the day of simultaneous opening matches. The 1962 World Cup began with four games, one in each group. Two of them (Uruguay 2-1 Colombia and Argentina 1-0 Bulgaria) were played by teams who would fail to reach the knockout rounds.

“Is it true that one of the goalscorers in the inaugural World Cup final between Uruguay and Argentina had only one arm?” asked Trevor Miller in 2006.

Indeed he did, Trevor. Uruguayan striker Héctor Castro was that man, having lost the lower part of his left limb in an unfortunate carpentry accident at the age of 13. Not that this swayed him from his dream, mind, as he went on to represent his country and even score the last-minute clinching goal in the 4-2 win over Argentina in 1930.

57,More women accuse US doctor who died by suicide of raping them while sedated,"A doctor in Florida who recently died by suicide after being arrested on allegations that he drugged and raped two patients is now accused of similarly attacking at least three other women under his care.

As of Tuesday, five patients of Eric Salata’s Pura Vida cosmetic surgery clinic in Naples had gone to police there and reported that the physician had either sexually assaulted them or attempted to during medical procedures, Adam Horowitz, an attorney for one of the women, said on Tuesday.

Horowitz added that the five women had filed about 11 police reports in total accusing Salata.

The latest allegations against Salata came about eight days after his body was found in a woodland. Investigators determined he had shot himself while out on bond a week after police arrested him on suspicion of raping two of his patients while they were unconscious.

Officers alleged that Salata incapacitated one of the patients – aged 51 – with laughing gas, the anti-anxiety medication Xanax and tequila, which the doctor claimed were forms of pain relief for the procedure she had hired him to perform.

The other of those surgical patients, who was 72, reported that Salata raped her – leaving her lip bruised – after administering laughing gas to her.

Naples police arrested Salata on 21 November, after which he was released on bond. A third woman with similar allegations against Salata then came forward after his arrest made the news.

On 28 November, deputies with the sheriff’s office in Collier county – which includes Naples – responded to a request to check on Salata after he left his home leaving behind two notes, his wedding ring and his credit cards, according to a police report obtained by WINK-TV.

That report redacted the notes’ contents. But deputies ultimately went to the last known location of Salata, who was wearing an ankle monitor that a judge had ordered to track his movements while he was out on bond. There, authorities said they found his corpse in a ditch next to a gun.

Investigators have since said they determined that Salata had intentionally shot himself in the head.

Word of Salata’s growing number of victims on Tuesday came after his arrest and subsequent suicide landed in news headlines across the US.

Salata was scheduled for a court appearance on 19 December on the two counts of sexual battery to a physically helpless person with which he had been booked. He could have faced between six and 30 years in prison for either of those charges if convicted.

At least one of Salata’s accusers had sued Pura Vida for damages by Tuesday, the local outlet WFTX-TV reported.

Pura Vida’s website was no longer online, and calls to the clinic’s phone number were going directly to voicemail. Last week, a recording on the clinic’s voicemail said the facility had closed indefinitely.

The cosmetic surgeon’s downfall follows that of neurologist Ricardo Cruciani, who killed himself in a New York City jail in August while awaiting sentencing for his conviction on charges that he had sexually abused patients. Cruciani, who maintained his innocence, faced a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

58,Sister of Iran’s supreme leader condemns protest crackdown,"A sister of Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has spoken out against his bloody crackdown on nationwide demonstrations, saying her brother’s “despotic caliphate” has brought nothing but suffering, according to a letter published by her exiled son.

The letter came a day after the country’s former president Mohammad Khatami also issued a rare statement to voice support for the protest movement, adding pressure on the regime from powerful political figures.

In her letter, Badri Hosseini Khamenei, who lives in Iran, called on the country’s feared Revolutionary Guards and “mercenaries” to lay down their weapons as soon as possible and “join the people”. She said she would herself join the rallies were it not for her poor health.

“I think it is appropriate now to declare that I oppose my brother’s actions and I express my sympathy with all mothers mourning the crimes of the Islamic Republic,” she wrote in the note that was shared on the Twitter account of her son, Mahmoud Moradkhani, and dated December 2022.

Badri Hosseini Khamenei comes from a side of the family that has had a fraught relationship with the regime since it took power in a 1979 revolution that overthrew the western-friendly Shah. Her husband, Ali Tehrani, lived for years in exile in Iraq and regularly criticised the Islamic republic in radio broadcasts. On his return in 1995, Tehrani spent 10 years in jail. He died in October this year.

“The crimes of this system, the suppression of any dissenting voice, the imprisonment of the most educated and the most caring youth of this land, the most severe punishments, and the large-scale executions began from the very beginning,” Khamenei said in her letter.

She suggested that she had decided to speak publicly after her daughter, Farideh Moradkhani, who also lives in Tehran, was detained last month. Moradkhani had long-criticised the regime, including in a video message released after her arrest that accused the government of not being “loyal to any of its religious principles”.

“Losing a child and being away from your child is a great sadness for every mother,” Khamenei wrote of her daughter. “Many mothers were bereaved during the last four decades. I think it is appropriate now to declare that I oppose my brother’s actions and I express my sympathy with all mothers mourning the crimes of the Islamic Republic regime, from the time of [the former supreme leader Ruhollah] Khomeini to the current era of the despotic caliphate of Ali Khamenei.

“My concern has always been and will always be the people, especially the women of Iran. I believe that the regime of the Islamic Republic of Khomeini and Ali Khamenei has brought nothing but suffering and oppression to Iran and Iranians.”

She accused her brother of not listening to his people, and instead taking counsel from “his mercenaries and money-grubbers”.

Iran’s clerics are facing their most ferocious challenge yet after the death in September of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, sparked a nationwide uprising.

Amini was arrested for improperly wearing her headscarf and was apparently beaten into a coma by Iran’s “morality police”. In the days after her death, girls and women nationwide abandoned their legally imposed dress code and ripped off their hijabs.

Meanwhile, Tehran has presented the protest movement as a security crisis and has accused “terrorists” of killing dozens of security force members. On Tuesday, authorities sentenced five people to death for allegedly killing a member of a paramilitary force affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards, state media reported. Eleven others received prison sentences.

The 13 men and three minors – none of whom have been identified – were charged with killing Ruhollah Ajamian, a member of the Basij, a paramilitary volunteer branch of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, according to the report from Irna, a state news agency. According to Amnesty International, Iran executed at least 314 people in 2021.

Iran regularly sentences people on charges related to espionage and has painted the protest movement as a western-backed plot. The UN office of the high commissioner for human rights says more than 300 people have been killed so far in the crackdown, including more than 40 children.

Wednesday marked the final day of a three-day nationwide strike called for by the protesters. In posts circulating on social media, demonstrators asked businesses to shutter their doors.

The rallies have gained widespread backing across Iran, including from celebrities and famous athletes. On Tuesday, Khatami added his voice to the support, describing as “beautiful” the movement’s main slogan – “Woman, life, freedom”.

Khatami, a 79-year-old reformist who served as Iran’s president from 1997 to 2005 but has since been sidelined, said the chant was “a beautiful message that shows movement towards a better future”.

“Freedom and security must not be placed against each other,” he said in a statement quoted by Isna news agency Tuesday, on the eve of Students’ Day.

“Freedom must not be trampled on in order to maintain security” and “security should not be ignored in the name of freedom”, he added.

59,US judge dismisses case against Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi killing,"A US judge has dismissed a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman that claimed he conspired to kill journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying the crown prince was entitled to sovereign immunity despite “credible allegations” that he was involved in the murder.

Judge John Bates, a US district court judge with a long history of presiding over cases involving national security, acknowledged “uneasiness” in making the decision, but said that his hands were in effect tied by the Biden administration’s recent recommendation that Prince Mohammed be given immunity.

The decision to dismiss the civil claim, which was brought by Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, and Dawn, a pro-democracy group founded by the murdered journalist, likely marks the end of efforts to hold the future Saudi king accountable for the 2018 murder.

The dismissal of the civil claim against Prince Mohammed and two of his close associates – Saud al-Qahtani and Ahmed al-Asiri – means the Saudi heir can now travel to the US and other jurisdictions freely. Although the case was not brought by US prosecutors with the power to arrest him, if it had been allowed to proceed, the case would have created a legal minefield for the crown prince and if he had been found guilty, could have put his financial interests in the US in jeopardy.

“One episode in our struggle for justice for Jamal may have concluded but the battle will never be over until all perpetrators including MBS are brought to justice,” said Abdullah Alaoudh, research director for Saudi Arabia at Dawn, a co-plaintiff in the case.

Saudi dissidents and critics of Prince Mohammed have previously expressed grave concerns about any possibility of the crown prince being granted immunity, saying any such decision would seal the aura of impunity around the 37-year-old prince, and could be seen as offering him a license to target other journalists and dissidents around the world.

Khashoggi’s brutal murder in 2018 created an international outcry. An investigation by Agnes Callamard, then the UN’s special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, found that Khashoggi had been the victim of a “deliberate, premeditated execution” for which the state of Saudi Arabia was responsible under human rights law.

Using recordings of conversations from inside Saudi’s Istanbul consulate where he was murdered and dismembered with a bone saw, Callamard reported that Khashoggi had been confronted in his final moments by Saudi officials, including one who said: “We are coming to get you.”

In the minutes that followed, her report found, a struggle could be heard, and rustling plastic, suggesting the Washington Post columnist may have been suffocated using a plastic bag.

In an angry statement to the Guardian, Callamard, who is now director general of Amnesty International, listed multiple parties who she claimed had “contributed to the impunity for the state murder of Jamal Khashoggi”, from Saudi Arabia itself, to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, to Joe Biden.

“And I am not mentioning all the governments, and the heads of businesses, sporting and cultural events who courted, sold and bought from the state responsible for murdering Jamal Khashoggi. This is the reality of our world. Press freedom and human rights betrayed. Repeatedly. But still we stand. And still we fight. And we are not defeated. We know the truth,” she said.

Prince Mohammed has said he takes responsibility for the murder but has denied any personal involvement in approving the killing.

Judge Bates’s ruling comes years after then-candidate Biden promised that he would hold the Saudi crown prince accountable for the murder if he was elected president and suggested that Prince Mohammed ought to be treated as a “global pariah” for his alleged role in the killing.

Shortly after entering the White House, it appeared that Biden would follow through on the campaign promise.

His administration released an unclassified intelligence report that concluded that “MBS”, as he is known, had likely approved the killing. But no further sanctions against the crown prince or his vast business interests in the US followed. Last summer, Biden fist-bumped the crown prince ahead of a meeting in Jeddah that was seen as an attempt to rescue the relationship. Then, last month, the state department suggested that Prince Mohammed be granted immunity, citing a recent promotion of the crown prince to the role of prime minister.

Human rights defenders and Cengiz’s own lawyers said the promotion had been a ruse intended solely for the purpose of escaping accountability, an allegation that neither the Biden administration nor the court denied.

In his decision, Judge Bates stressed that US law and separation of powers, which forces the judiciary to show deference to executive branch opinions on foreign immunity, compelled him to agree with the Biden administration’s decision on the case, even though he seemed to acknowledge that the circumstances around Prince Mohammed’s sudden elevation to prime minister were “suspect”.

“The Executive Branch remains responsible for foreign affairs, including with Saudi Arabia, and a contrary decision on bin Salman’s immunity by this court would unduly interfere with those responsibilities all the same,” the judge wrote.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/us-judge-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-khashoggi,2022-12-06T00:00:00
60,‘A cultural reckoning’: how an allegation of rape in Australia’s parliament sparked a firestorm,"It is a case that has shaken Australian politics to its core. An allegation of rape in the nation’s parliament, levelled by a government staffer against a colleague, has led to senior ministers appearing before court, triggered a slew of internal reviews and forced a reckoning over the gendered dynamic and toxic atmosphere plaguing an ecosystem devoid of workplace protections.

While Brittany Higgins’ story has become a mainstay of Australia’s political discourse, in recent days it has taken an extraordinary turn. Last week, before a retrial after the first was abandoned due to juror misconduct, the prosecution of the accused man, Bruce Lehrmann, was aborted out of concern for Higgins’ mental health.

Lehrmann had pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent and at all times maintained his innocence and denied that any sexual activity occurred between himself and Higgins.

Now, the matter is likely to spill over into a civil case by Higgins against previous government ministers, with a potential multimillion-dollar compensation bill, and defamation claims by Lehrmann against the media and public figures who spoke out about the allegations.

It has also exposed shortcomings of Australia’s justice system in dealing with sexual assault claims, especially those at the centre of intense media scrutiny.

The firestorm

On 15 February 2021, Higgins made public the accusations and set off a firestorm. In a sit-down interview, she detailed how after an evening work function in Canberra in March 2019, when she was 24, she and Lehrmann returned to Parliament House, intoxicated, in the early hours of the morning.

During the trial, the court heard that Higgins alleged that the pair entered the office of her then boss, Linda Reynolds – a senior member of the conservative Liberal party and coalition that was then in government – where Lehrmann raped her.

Higgins claimed she lost consciousness and woke up on a sofa in the office to find Lehrmann on top of her. Lehrmann has repeatedly denied this version of events.

The court heard that records showed Lehrmann left parliament about an hour after arriving, and that a security guard found Higgins naked on the sofa hours later.

At the time, Reynolds was the minister for defence industry; she would become defence minister two months later and was still in that role at the time Higgins went public with her allegations.

The claim rocked Australia. In addition to the allegation of rape in such a senior office in the seat of Australia’s parliament, there were questions about how the incident had been handled.

In the days after the incident, the pair were questioned separately by their bosses about entering the office after hours. Lehrmann’s employment was soon terminated. Higgins raised a complaint with federal police but said she halted it out of fear that it would anger her superiors.

Higgins later transferred to work for another Liberal party minister. In the month before going to the media with her story, she quit her job and approached police to reopen the matter.

Less than a day after the story broke, questions were raised about who in government had known about the allegations. Higgins claimed she had raised the rape allegation with her bosses, but the ministers she worked for denied having been told.

Higgins’ story kickstarted a wave of revelations. Media soon reported a past rape allegation levelled against the then attorney general, who strenuously denied the claims and went on to start defamation proceedings against the national broadcaster. Claims surfaced of affairs between other ministers and staffers, and inappropriate touching.

After Higgins’ claims aired, there was a protest march to the lawns of Australia’s parliament house to draw attention to the treatment of women. Higgins addressed the rally wearing suffragette white.

By this point, multiple inquiries had been launched, including into workplace culture for parliamentary workers, and into who knew what in the prime minister’s office.

A defamation suit had sprung up over comments that Reynolds allegedly made, which she did not deny, calling Higgins a “lying cow” over Higgins’ claims that Reynolds did not support her former staffer in the aftermath of the incident. The comments were allegedly made in Reynolds’ office, overheard by department workers present on secondment, and were later reported in the media. Reynolds and Higgins settled the matter, with Reynolds paying damages.

This caused further headaches for the prime minister Scott Morrison’s government, which was struggling to defend itself from claims that it was unpopular with women.

Prof Catharine Lumby, the head of the University of Sydney’s media department and a longtime gender equality advocate, said Higgins’ case provoked an examination of the discrimination that women have encountered in Australia’s political circles and in workplaces more broadly.

She said Higgins’ allegations, as they related to parliament, carried a certain gravity that demanded a response from the highest levels. “There is no question we have gone through a cultural reckoning in this country as a result of Brittany Higgins’ story and all those young women who followed,” Lumby said.

Lumby believes Higgins’ case became “a crucible in which a whole lot of other issues got swept up”, and the government’s handling of it angered women, which contributed to women abandoning the Morrison government in this year’s election.

The trial

Meanwhile, the legal case against Lehrmann slowly progressed. The trial began in October this year, but after prolonged deliberations the jury was dismissed after the court learned a juror had brought outside evidence about the matter into deliberations. A retrial was slated for next year.

However, last Friday, the retrial was dropped. The director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, said independent medical evidence suggested there was a “significant and unacceptable risk to the life of the complainant” if a second trial was pursued.

Suppression orders were later lifted, making public that Higgins had had a mental health crisis during the first trial when giving evidence.

Without the prospect of a retrial, Lehrmann remains entitled to the presumption of innocence. The saga has prompted questions about how alleged victims navigate Australia’s justice system. Higgins is calling for legal reform, saying she had not fully understood the country’s “asymmetrical criminal justice system” before she raised the rape allegation.

The role of the media in reporting cases of high public interest is also in the spotlight. Several News Corp outlets have been critical of the role some journalists were playing in the story. This week its national broadsheet, the Australian, highlighted calls for Drumgold to resign over the trial.

In his announcement last Friday, Drumgold said: “During the investigation and trial, as a sexual assault complainant, Ms Higgins has faced a level of personal attack that I have not seen in over 20 years of doing this work. She’s done so with bravery, grace and dignity, and it is my hope that this will now stop.”

Higgins is expected to launch a civil case against Reynolds, another minister she worked for, and the government, seeking a rumoured $3m in compensation. Reynolds has indicated she wants to fight the claim.

61,"Trump Organization guilty of tax fraud, New York jury finds","A jury in New York has convicted the Trump Organization of criminal tax fraud in a stinging rebuke of the former US president’s company.

Although Donald Trump was not personally on trial, prosecutors in the case brought by the Manhattan district attorney insisted he was fully aware of the long-running scheme in which they said executives were enriched by off-the-books perks to make up for lower salaries, reducing the company’s tax liabilities.

“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement celebrating the guilty verdict. “In Manhattan, no corporation is above the law.”

The 12-person jury in New York’s state court was sent out to deliberate on Monday morning after a six-week trial in which Trump Organization lawyers pinned blame for the fraud solely on the greed of longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg.

Trump, who recently launched his 2024 campaign, assailed the investigation as part of a politically motivated “witch hunt”. In a statement on Tuesday, the Trump Organization denounced the verdict, which could carry a fine of up to $1.6m, a relatively negligible sum for such a large company though it could affect future business dealings. A lawyer for the Trump Organization vowed to appeal.

“The notion that a company could be held responsible for an employee’s actions, to benefit themselves, on their own personal tax returns is simply preposterous,” the company said in a statement.

Weisselberg, the former close ally of Trump accepted a plea deal earlier this year admitting fraud in exchange for a five-month prison sentence. Prosecutors laid out a case heavily reliant on Weisselberg’s testimony.

The verdict represents a serious blow to Trump and his family who rose to fame as property moguls in New York but whose business practices have long shadowed in secrecy with rumors of ill-doing.

It is also the latest in a raft of legal troubles that surround Trump, including several investigations related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election victory of Joe Biden and his apparent removal of sensitive White House documents to his Florida resort of Mar-a-Lago.

The monthlong trial featured testimony from seven witnesses, including Weisselberg, one of Trump’s most loyal lieutenants, and senior vice-president and controller Jeffrey McConney. An outside accountant who spent years preparing tax returns for Trump and the company also testified. In their closing statement to the jury, prosecutors alleged that Trump had “explicitly sanctioned tax fraud”.

During their deliberations, jurors had zeroed in on the last count listed on the verdict sheet: falsifying business records. Jurors sent notes twice Tuesday asking for clarity on the falsifying business records charge and a reading of related testimony.

Weisselberg testified that he ordered accounts payable supervisor Deborah Tarasoff to delete “per Allen Weisselberg” notations from entries in Trump’s personal general ledger reflecting that Trump personally paid private school tuition for Weisselberg’s grandchildren.

First, jurors asked the judge to reread the charge and the elements they are required to find for a guilty verdict. Later, they asked to again hear Tarasoff’s testimony. Tarasoff, a Trump Organization veteran, testified that Weisselberg called her into his office and told her, “Go in and take my name off it” in September 2016.

After resuming deliberations Tuesday, jurors sent a note asking the judge to reread three counts of falsifying business records pertaining to the creation of false W2 tax forms for Weisselberg for 2015, 2016 and 2017.

The case does not bring to a close the legal challenges facing Trump and his businesses – far from it. Bragg has said that a related investigation he inherited from his predecessor, district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr, is “ongoing”. In that case, investigators are reportedly focused on assessing the integrity of the Trump Organization’s financial statements.

And earlier this year, the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, brought a sweeping civil suit against the former president, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization after a lengthy investigation by her office. That suit, which is still pending, accuses Trump and his children of “staggering” fraud, alleging that they provided fraudulent statements to lenders and insurers that wildly inflated the value of his real estate holdings.

In a statement, James commended Bragg and his team for their successful prosecution of the former president’s company. “We can have no tolerance for individuals or organizations that violate our laws to line their pockets,” she said, adding: “This verdict sends a clear message that no one and no organization is above our laws.”

The legal woes have to a large extent over-shadowed Trump’s recent announcement of his new White House run.

Though Trump’s campaign was launched with great fanfare from Mar-a-Lago, it has not set the political world alight after high profile Trump-backed candidates were largely defeated in November’s midterm elections.

Numerous rivals to Trump are now starting to emerge in the Republican party, especially Florida governor Ron DeSantis.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/trump-organization-guilty-verdict-tax-fraud,2022-12-06T00:00:00
62,Tokyo Olympics bribery scandal threatens to derail Winter Games bid,"More than a year after the Tokyo Olympics were held in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, their legacy has been overshadowed by a bribery scandal that threatens to derail a bid by another Japanese city to host the Winter Games.

This summer, as officials in Sapporo, on Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido, promoted their bid for the 2030 Games, police arrested Haruyuki Takahashi, a former Tokyo Olympics executive, on suspicion of taking bribes in return for helping companies become official sponsors for last year’s event.

Seiko Hashimoto, who replaced Yoshiro Mori as head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee after her predecessor made sexist remarks about female sports administrators, this month acknowledged the corruption allegations could negatively affect Sapporo’s chances.

Describing the situation as “very severe”, Hashimoto said she hoped investigators would get to the bottom of the 2020 allegations as soon as possible. “The significance and value of the Tokyo Games have come into question,” she added, according to Kyodo news agency.

Takahashi, who is believed to have had a key role in selecting sponsors, was last month indicted for a fourth time, with the former senior managing director at Japan’s biggest advertising agency, Dentsu, suspected of accepting 198m yen (£1.2m) in bribes from five firms. He has denied the allegations.

In all, 15 people have been indicted over the scandal, including the former president of a Tokyo-based doll-maker that produced the Olympic and Paralympic mascots, as well as former and current executives from Aoki Holdings, a suit retailer that supplied the Japanese team’s uniforms, and a publishing firm and advertising agency.

Mori, a former prime minister, volunteered to be interviewed by prosecutors in September amid reports that Aoki had given him money. Prosecutors said Mori had been questioned as an unsworn witness and not as a suspect.

In a separate development, police raided Dentsu’s headquarters late last month in connection with allegations that bids had been rigged to decide which companies worked on test events for the Tokyo Games, which were postponed by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Dentsu was instrumental in helping Tokyo win the 2020 Games when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided the host city in 2013. The company then secured record domestic sponsorship worth about 376bn yen (£2.25bn) – three times that raised for London 2012, the previous record-holder.

Involvement in the pre-Olympic test events would have put companies at a distinct advantage when it came to selecting firms to work on events during the 2020 Games.

“We continue to fully cooperate with this investigation,” Dentsu said in a statement. Aoki Holdings previously said it would cooperate with authorities.

Sapporo last hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972 and had been hoping the Tokyo Games, which were mostly held behind closed doors but ended without triggering a major Covid outbreak, would strengthen its bid.

Sapporo is generally seen as having a stronger case than its only rival, Salt Lake City, but its campaign has been overshadowed by negative headlines about Tokyo 2020. Vancouver dropped its bid in October after it failed to receive support from the British Columbia government. The IOC is due to decide the host city next October.

In October, the mayor of Sapporo, Katsuhiro Akimoto, and the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, Yasuhiro Yamashita, abruptly cancelled a visit to the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, to promote the city’s bid. Yamashita claimed the decision had no connection with the bribery allegations, blaming “scheduling issues”.

Michael Payne, who is credited with using sponsorship to transform the IOC’s brand and finances as its director of marketing from 1989 to 2004, has said the bribery scandal is unlikely to affect Sapporo’s “technically very strong bid”.

“I think of this very much as a local, political issue,” Payne told Agence France-Presse after Akimoto’s cancelled visit. “It raised eyebrows as to why they’re making such a meal out of what frankly is minor sponsor influence-peddling.”

Although a survey conducted earlier this year found most Hokkaido residents supported the 2030 bid, Sapporo has rejected calls for a citywide referendum.

The Asahi Shimbun said the scandal pointed to a “crucial lack of commitment to fairness and transparency”.

“If the allegations turn out to be true, this is an extraordinary scandal involving almost all the parties among those awarding and receiving contracts. It is no wonder that the scandal is evoking deep public distrust,” the newspaper said in an editorial this week. “A new bid to host the Olympics cannot win public support unless structural problems behind the scandal are rectified.”

The IOC has attempted to distance itself from the scandal. Its president, Thomas Bach, did not attend an October ceremony at Tokyo’s national stadium to mark the first anniversary of the Olympics and Paralympics, citing a scheduling conflict.

“We have full confidence in the Japanese authorities and also the auditors of the organising committee,” the IOC said in a statement. “The IOC has every interest in the full clarification of this case.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/tokyo-olympics-bribery-scandal-threatens-sapporo-winter-games-bid,2022-12-07T00:00:00
63,Hana Kimura death: Mother of reality star sues producers of Terrace House TV show,"The mother of Hana Kimura, a former professional wrestler who killed herself after appearing in the Japanese reality TV show Terrace House, has sued the programme’s producers, claiming the show triggered the cyberbullying that led to her death.

Kimura, 22, killed herself in May 2020 after being subjected to abuse and harassment on social media following her appearances on the popular show, which featured a disparate group of strangers living together.

Kyoko Kimura is seeking around ¥142m yen ($1m) in compensation from three companies, including Fuji Television. In her suit, filed with the Tokyo district court, Kimura claims the defendants produced the show in a way that encouraged viewers to turn against her daughter.

The reality TV star began self-harming after a scene in which she had an altercation with a male cast member was streamed on Netflix in March 2020 before being broadcast on television, according to Japanese media accounts of the lawsuit.

The scene triggered the online abuse that caused Hana to kill herself, the suit alleges. Her mother claimed that Fuji TV and the two production companies intentionally staged and edited scenes to portray her daughter in a negative light.

“I wanted to avoid a court case, but I was forced to file the lawsuit because [the defendants] have not responded with sincerity,” Kimura said at a news conference on Tuesday. “I don’t want any more young people to have their dreams exploited.”

Kimura’s death highlighted the growing problem of cyberbullying in Japan, prompting calls for the government to take more action against anonymous social media users who post abusive content.

In June, the parliament passed an amendment to the penal code making online insults punishable by up to a year in prison or a maximum fine of ¥300,000.

The lawsuit said the producers had a responsibility to address negative reactions to the programme by monitoring Hana’s physical and psychological health during the entire process of shooting, editing and streaming the programme, the Asahi Shimbun reported.

Kyoko Kimura accused the producers of treating cast members as “dispensable”.

She told reporters that if she had been in their position, “I would not have been able to do the same thing if a family member or someone I loved appeared on the programme. I wanted the producers to treat the cast members as human beings.”

The defendants did not comment on the case, saying they had yet to receive details of the suit. The programme was cancelled after Kimura’s death.

In a separate case in May 2021, a court ordered a man to pay Kyoko Kimura ¥1.29m in damages for posting hateful messages about Hana after her death.

Her mother also filed a complaint with a broadcasting watchdog in 2020, claiming the show had violated her daughter’s human rights. The body concluded in 2021 that the programme had “ethical problems” but had not violated her human rights, Japanese media reported.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/hana-kimura-death-mother-of-reality-star-sues-producers-of-terrace-house-tv-show,2022-12-07T00:00:00
64,"Albanian children facing racist bullying due to UK asylum row, says envoy","Albanian children are being subjected to racist bullying in UK schools because of the debate surrounding arrivals by small boats, the country’s ambassador in London has said.

Qirjako Qirko spoke out after Albanians were singled out by ministers and sections of the media during the recent rise in the number of his country’s citizens travelling across the Channel to claim asylum in the UK.

He called for an end to the “campaign of discrimination” and warned against reinforcing negative stereotypes. His comments appear to be aimed at the UK government after Suella Braverman, the home secretary, singled out “Albanian criminals” during a debate on the crisis.

The government, encouraged by rightwing media outlets and MPs, is seeking to stop Albanians from being able to claim asylum in the UK.

Qirko said more than 140,000 Albanians living in the UK had been negatively affected by the debate, which was “reinforcing negative stereotypes and racism”.

“This campaign of discrimination against Albanians living here in the UK should stop. There are people, especially youngsters, who are bullied in their schools because they are Albanians. Everyone who is responsible for this activity should apologise,” he said.

Earlier, he told MPs Albanian “doctors, lawyers, engineers, labourers of all sorts, pay taxes and contribute to the British society. Any other different portrayal of Albanians in the UK is a demonstration of a lack of knowledge of this reality. Reinforcing negative stereotypes over a prolonged time fosters only discrimination and racism.”

The UK government is reportedly planning a blanket ban on anyone from a list of designated “safe” countries claiming asylum.

Plans supposedly being drawn up by No 10 have outlined legislation to make it easier to reject and remove asylum seekers from Albania. Under the proposed changes, claims would be automatically refused and a check that officials are currently expected to carry out would be removed.

The move is designed to target Albanians after more than 12,000 arrived from the Balkan country via small boats in the nine months to September – accounting for about a quarter of all Channel crossings. The Guardian understands the number of Albanians coming to the UK has fallen over the last two months.

More than half – 55% – of adult Albanian asylum applicants were successful at the initial decision stage, according to the government’s latest data.

Analysis from the Oxford Migration Observatory revealed last month that 86% of Albanians who received positive decisions on asylum applications in the year ending June 2022 were women, whose leave to remain was granted on the basis they were likely to have been trafficked and in genuine need of protection.

Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, has called for Albanians to be “barred” from applying for asylum because Albania is considered a safe country.

Qirko also said Albania was a safe country, saying that many Albanians who came to the UK via small boats did sofor economic reasons. “This country needs workers, there are vacancies, [change] British legislation so we can have this opportunity so that people can come legally,” he said.

Other witnesses disputed claims that Albania could be categorised as a safe country.

Dr Andi Hoxhaj, a lecturer in law from University College London, said a third of Albanians lived below the poverty line and there was 60% unemployment. He said honour killings under a code of conduct known as “Kanun” still held sway over many people’s lives across the country, and that gang-related violence and corruption was widespread.

“It is a hybrid democracy – there is a level of corruption, there is high unemployment,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/07/albanian-children-facing-racist-bullying-uk-asylum-row,2022-12-07T00:00:00
65,Police say arrested men not linked to Raheem Sterling break-in,"Police officers continue to investigate a burglary at the home of the England footballer Raheem Sterling after a potential lead proved to be short-lived.

Surrey police said they were questioning two men arrested on suspicion of a separate offence of attempted burglary on Tuesday in connection to the break-in at Sterling’s property in Oxshott, Surrey.

But later on Wednesday, the force said the arrests were not being linked to the theft of items at the Chelsea winger’s home and the investigation continued.

Jewellery said to be worth £300,000 was reported as stolen from Sterling’s home when his fiancee, Paige Milian, returned from an overseas trip on Saturday.

A statement from Surrey police said: “Two men were arrested on suspicion of attempted burglary last night (6 December) in the Oxshott area. They are currently in custody.

“Following reports of suspicious activity around 6.40pm, a number of resources were deployed, including the dog unit and the police helicopter. Our colleagues from British Transport Police also provided assistance.

“At this time these arrests are not being linked to an ongoing investigation into a burglary that received significant media coverage over the weekend. That separate investigation remains ongoing and as of 12:00 on Wednesday 7 December no arrests have been made in connection with that.

“Officers are carrying out enquiries into the circumstances and the investigation remains on going.”

Sterling rushed home from the World Cup in Qatar after being told about the break-in, reportedly shaken and concerned about the wellbeing of his children following the incident.

No one was present at the property when the burglary took place and there had been no threat of violence, contrary to some media reports, police said.

Footballers, pundits and commentators offered messages of support to Sterling on social media, including the Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who offered the family his sympathy over their “awful and harrowing ordeal”.

It is understood the Football Association offered security guidance to players before leaving for Qatar, with an experienced team on hand to advise and provide support when needed.

The Sun reported that a guard provided by Chelsea football club was stationed at Sterling’s home, and that the 27-year-old planned to increase security.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/07/police-investigate-second-burglary-raheem-sterling-break-in-world-cup,2022-12-07T00:00:00
66,San Francisco lawmakers vote to ban killer robots in drastic U-turn,"San Francisco lawmakers voted to ban police robots from using deadly force on Tuesday, reversing course one week after officials had approved the practice and sparked national outrage.

The city’s board of supervisors voted to explicitly prohibit the San Francisco police department (SFPD) from using the 17 robots in its arsenal to kill people. The board, however, also sent the issue back to a committee for further review, which means it could later decide to allow lethal force in some circumstances.

The U-turn came after the majority of members on the 11-person board had voted last week to allow robots to be armed with explosives and use them to kill people “when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available to SFPD”. The board had also added an amendment saying that only high-ranking officers would be allowed to authorize deadly force.

The initial decision to allow “killer robots” was met with widespread criticism from civil rights groups and shone a harsh light on the increasing militarization of US police forces.

Supervisors and police officials who had originally supported the use of lethal force had said the robots would kill people only in extraordinary cases, such as suicide bombing or active shooter situations.

Hilary Ronen, one of three supervisors who originally voted against deploying killer robots, said at last week’s meeting: “I’m surprised that we’re here in 2022. We have seen a history of these leading to tragedy and destruction all over the world.” After Tuesday’s reversal, she tweeted: “Common sense prevailed.”

We just stopped the use of killer robots robots in SF. Complete reversal from last week. Common sense prevailed. — Hillary Ronen (@HillaryRonen) December 6, 2022

The new policy does allow SFPD to use robots for situational awareness, such as sending the equipment into dangerous situations while officers stay behind.

On Monday, supervisor Gordon Mar tweeted that he regretted voting in favor of lethal robots and said he’d be switching his position: “Even with additional guardrails, I’ve grown increasingly uncomfortable with our vote & the precedent it sets for other cities without as strong a commitment to police accountability. I do not think making state violence more remote, distanced, & less human is a step forward.

“I do not think robots with lethal force will make us safer, or prevent or solve crimes,” he added.

San Francisco police have a controversial history of using lethal force against civilians, and one former officer is now facing manslaughter charges for an on-duty killing.

The SFPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

67,Ben Stokes’s all-conquering captaincy marks daring England win a true great,"Joel Wilson knew it was over. You could tell from the way he pointed his finger, almost directly at Naseem Shah: so decisive, so cinematic, the gesture of a man who expects it to be replayed many times.

But first there was the review, and as often in this match, it took ages to come. A gripping denouement was eked out even longer as everyone waited for ball-tracking, and the crowd, who had started their “oohs” too early, were forced to drop an octave and begin again. Even Brendon McCullum looked as if he was feeling the tension.

Among the cache of long-remembered moments from England’s astonishing victory in Rawalpindi, many will capture the final day. Ben Stokes zinging the ball past the edge of the bat and Ollie Robinson singeing it on the side of the stumps. Ollie Pope bunting away a leg-side chance off Azhar Ali, then redeeming himself with an even more difficult one off Zahid Mahmood. Pope casting his entire team into purgatory as he and Joe Root watched the ball fly between them instead of taking what should have been the final catch of the game.

It wasn’t all about England. There was Agha Salman’s tidy straight-drive that brought the target to less than 100 and, shortly after, Azhar chasing down the pitch to Jimmy Anderson and bringing up their 50 partnership. There was the sudden sound of the crowd’s renewed belief and an invisible charge in the air. All of this was powered by Stokes’s declaration.

There was no time for patience and no room for error; every on-field movement felt as precise and intentional as dance choreography. Naseem’s Zorro-style leaves. Stokes jogging back to his mark. Mohammad Ali playing dainty defence, then ducking off at the last drinks break, daring the umpires to ask about his bladder.

Images sparked memories and drew comparisons, some with matches we’d never seen, only their traces in black-and-white: a strangulated John Inverarity in 1968, Derek Underwood drawing his net ever tighter. We’ve seen close-in fields before, every head craned within range of collision. Far rarer to see short-leg knelt in the prayer position, hands extended for a crumb of a catch.

This was England’s third win in Pakistan, after Lahore in 1961 and Karachi in 2000. As the egg-washed sky darkened and a yolky sun began its descent, it was that last win that came to mind. Up in the commentary box, Nasser Hussain was too classy to compare heroics. His team’s win was more dramatic, more vital to a cricketing nation’s self-worth. But this one was better.

Hussain had to fight the light in the final session; Stokes conquered a pitch for five majestic days. The flaccid Pindi wicket was as much his opposing number as Babar Azam and the way he bent it to his will felt Napoleonic, a sporting equivalent of Austerlitz.

To what in cricket do we compare it and where will it stand in the ultimate account? So many of England’s legendary victories have been in the nature of seemingly impossible comebacks, which befits a country that prefers to dress as the underdog. The Headingleys, 1981 and 2019, were the greatest of escapes, where the safe harbour of a draw was never in sight. And you’d have needed strong binoculars to spy it out at the Oval in 1902, when England were 48 for five, before Gilbert Jessop launched his own Stokesian blitz on Australia’s bowlers.

A match England dominated from day one doesn’t share the same step on the podium as these. Its finish, while thrilling, would probably lose out to an Edgbaston 2005, in the popular imagination at least. But it scores highly in several other categories. Its natural stablemates are the games England have bossed against the laws of man and of physics, such as Melbourne in 2010-11. Andrew Strauss’s side, pummelled in Perth, leapt back off the mat to bowl Australia out for 98, and were 157 without loss by the close of day one – the kind of opening to an Ashes Test that England had so often been the wrong side of. A first innings score of 513 put a positive outcome beyond the doubt of even their most lily-livered fans.

Forcing wins in Asia has always been a victory in its own right, and two of England’s great recent performances in Mumbai make for worthwhile comparisons. In 2005-06, their first win in India in two decades was secured despite illness and injury in the camp, not unlike this most recent effort. And the 10-wicket win in 2012-13 under Alastair Cook was only made possible – just as here in Rawalpindi – by some bold and era-defining batting. In that instance, it was one special innings, Kevin Pietersen’s 186 off 223 balls. Against Pakistan, four England players made hundreds and all at strike rates that made KP look a sluggard.

What made this game of Ultimate Bazball stand out was more than its record-breaking run-rates. England’s captain had utter confidence in the ballsy plan and his team’s ability to carry it out, bowlers included. His attack took 20 wickets on a pitch that was DOA – a pitch that had expired, run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. Perhaps one meaningful comparison is Johannesburg in 2005, when Matthew Hoggard bowled out South Africa’s staunch batting side after England had declared twice and set a target of 325. They were given two sessions to go for them; Stokes offered Pakistan twice that.

His risk-led leadership is unprecedented in English cricket and he has proved he can make it pay. Rawalpindi joins the top echelon of Test-match glory not because we’ve never seen its like before, but because, the way this team are changing the game, we may well see it again.

68,‘Our belief is unrivalled’: Ollie Robinson hails his proudest moment,"An England team batting like they are in something of a rush was hit by an immediate delay when travelling from Rawalpindi, scene of their seismic victory against Pakistan in the first Test, to bustling Multan.

As the press corps went by road through the Valley of Peacocks, Kallar Kahar, past the orange groves of Sargodha and the smoking brick kilns on the outskirts of Faisalabad, the two teams were stuck at the airport for nearly four hours on account of fog at their charter flight’s destination.

It may not be the last time fog proves an inconvenience. The second Test that is due to begin on Friday could face possible delayed starts to go with the early finishes caused by bad light. The last first-class match staged in Multan in December was 12 years ago.

Pakistan need to strike back instantly, of course, having been taken aback by the aggression England showed when racking up 921 runs from 136.5 overs in ’Pindi. Mohammad Rizwan, their wicketkeeper, marvelled at the “new style of cricket” the tourists have brought to Test cricket but that his teammates “cannot change overnight”.

That said, the inventive tactics and the sustained energy Ben Stokes mustered from his troops in the field is arguably the greatest feather in the captain’s cap. Not least when defending a target of 343 runs in four sessions on a road, with all but the last wicket to fall – Jack Leach winkling out last man Naseem Shah moments before sunset – claimed by the seamers.

Jimmy Anderson was otherworldly in the circumstances, match-figures of five for 88 from 46 overs as sublime as the freshly squeezed orange juice on sale by the roadside en route to Multan. But it was Ollie Robinson’s performance that will possibly have surprised a few people – not least in Australia, where, unprepared for the physical work, he blew a gasket during last winter’s Ashes.

Robinson just kept coming at the Pakistan batting, one half of the hostile and sustained bouncer barrage alongside Stokes on the fourth evening – Joe Root’s idea, as it happens – and then the game-breaker on day five. His removal of Azhar Ali and Agha Salman after tea came with the hosts were five down and 87 runs required.

The 29-year-old was never short of a word or two in the middle and displayed excellent use of the old ball when it began to reverse. While he burst on to the international scene during the summer of 2021, picking up 28 wickets in five Tests at 19 runs apiece, those fourth-innings figures of four for 50 from 22 overs represented a new level unlocked.

“Comfortably,” said Robinson, when asked if it topped his personal highlights. “With all the hard work I’ve put in, the dark places that I’ve been, to come here to Pakistan and [help] take 20 wickets on that pitch is my proudest moment as an England cricketer.

“I woke up [on the fifth morning] and I didn’t feel sore. That’s a great sign for where my body is at. I’m very proud of the work that I’ve done and the England backroom staff and how good they’ve been with me to get me to this place.

“The belief that we’ve got in this dressing room is unrivalled. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

Robinson said that “after a couple of ice baths and a bit of treatment from the physio” he would be confident of backing this up in Multan. Mark Wood is also going to be in contention – he sent down rockets during the intervals of the first Test – giving Stokes a selection headache.

England may also face the Pakistan bowler Robinson revealed he sought out for advice during the summer, with overnight reports that Hampshire’s Mohammad Abbas may be called up to replace Haris Rauf, whose Test debut was ended after 13 overs by a thigh strain.

Abbas is the type of wristy, skilful bowler who may not mind misty mornings in Multan. But, even if even shorter playing hours do result, we already know how England will look to play him.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/06/englands-rapid-new-style-has-pakistan-scrambling-for-a-response,2022-12-06T00:00:00
69,Stokes and McCullum have lifted the pressure from the England Test side,"During the summer, as the Test side being reshaped by Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum found immediate success on home soil, there was very much a feeling among knowledgable cricket people that come their first trip abroad conditions in Pakistan would present much more of a challenge. But this team continues to write their own script, ignoring the conventions of the game, and even the flattest of pitches in Rawalpindi could not restrain them.

I have never seen such total alignment between a head coach, his captain, and the managing director, Rob Key, who selected them. I think of my international career, when it was an inviolable rule that individual players were given ownership of their game – they had been picked for their country and there was a prevailing view that you had reached the pinnacle of the game and it was not for someone else to tell you how to go out and play.

I always admired the way Alec Stewart and Graham Thorpe took the aggressive option if they could, particularly when players took that approach and it didn’t come off they were guaranteed to be hammered in the media.

That is the real sea change. I saw Mike Atherton on Sky praising Stokes’s declaration, which offered Pakistan a very achievable path to victory, explaining it would be fine for England to lose and that so long as we saw an entertaining product sport would be the winner.

This is a completely different message to anything I heard in 30 years in the game. The idea it would be acceptable for England to lose so long as they give it a go is one that never got anywhere near any team I was a part of. I played in an era when Ian Botham and Bob Willis would rip pieces out of you when you didn’t perform. Now – and it helps Key has key allies in extremely influential positions in the broadcast and written media – that pressure has almost disappeared.

Early in my career I had a conversation with Surrey’s Keith Medlycott, who had gone on England’s tour of West Indies in 1990 without making an international appearance. He told me he had been astonished by the pressure of Test cricket: “I can’t explain it, I can’t help you understand it, you just have to experience it,” he said. But over the past 10 months we have seen the way it feels being involved in the England team to completely flip. Clearly, it has been wonderfully liberating.

A number of things are aligning. The appointments, strategy and selection have fed into performances and are being backed up by powerful voices in the media, with the result that all the traditional consequences of failure for a player have been taken away.

What a great place this dressing room must be. Never in my career, at any level, have I seen players being told to go out, give it a crack and not to worry about the consequences. This freedom suits the young, modern-day player, with their innovative mindsets, their power, their range of shot.

It has come along at the perfect time for people such as Ollie Pope, Harry Brook and Will Jacks, guys who have grown up on T20 cricket, played in competitions around the world and have a mentality and a skillset that matches perfectly that of the team’s leadership.

In a different way it has also come at the perfect time for the 40-year-old Jimmy Anderson. How good it was to see him once again prove his versatility to those who believed that, however magnificent he has been in English conditions, he was destined to struggle in Pakistan. When you see Joe Root batting left-handed – it’s one thing being freed to challenge convention but this was almost verging on the disrespectful – you know something very unusual is happening.

Stokes spoke about the winning moment being an unbelievable high and after a victory like that, with his outstanding captaincy so fundamental, I can only imagine his sense of satisfaction. I’ve seen a lot of cricket and I just don’t know how they managed to win that game. To prise out those wickets on the final day was an unbelievable effort, but England almost looked like they were playing on a Saturday afternoon in local club cricket.

To demystify Test cricket, to completely take away the pressure of the environment, is a remarkable achievement. And what a contrast to Pakistan, playing in front of a large and expectant crowd, hosting a Test series against England for the first time since 2005 and chasing the game from the very first over when Zak Crawley hit three fours. They played very well in the first innings but England’s declaration put all the pressure back on them and they did not handle it particularly well.

This is just the third time England have won a Test in Pakistan, in 25 attempts. It is their second win there in the past 50 years. In any circumstances it is an exceptional achievement and this game will be long talked about. In an age when we are being saturated with so much short-format junk from all across the world, what a thrilling contrast this was.

Elsewhere in Asia, a football World Cup is being played and an England side is flourishing with a group of young players who have come through together, enjoy playing for their country and show athleticism, skill and a no-fear attitude. Both these teams are exciting and inspiring and the future could be brighter still.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/dec/06/cricket-stokes-mccullum-england-test,2022-12-06T00:00:00

71,‘We want to keep dreaming’ – the rise and rise of Roma Women,"Welcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian’s free women’s football newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below:

“Un Pari Che Sa Di Gloria” read the headline of il Romanista a fortnight ago: “A draw which has the taste of glory”. Champions League debutants Roma had just held Wolfsburg, one of the European greats, to a draw at home. It was a result that put progression into the knockout stages firmly in the Giallorosse’s grasp, sending a signal around the continent that there is very much a new kid in town.

Since acquiring the Serie A licence from Res Roma in 2018, Roma have made solid progress. Last season – Alessandro Spugna’s first in charge – they finished second and qualified for Europe for the first time. The ambition to be among the European elite is clear and their form has backed it up. Unbeaten in 15, they have leapt to the top of Serie A, leading Juventus by a comfortable six-point margin. They won the Coppa Italia in 2021 and that was followed by the Supercoppa Italia last month.

“We are a very ambitious club, and we want to try to win as many titles as possible,” Spugna tells Moving the Goalposts. “We know that to do this we need to improve. We already managed to get one trophy this season, the Super Cup, to which we attached a great importance. We are doing very well in the Italian league … as far as the Champions League is concerned, this is a dream. We want to keep dreaming. It’s very hard but it allows you to get better because you have to measure yourself against very big teams.”

Much of his side’s success has been down to the personnel acquired. The Giallorosse are an eclectic mix, blending some of Italy’s best with stars from abroad. The striker Valentina Giacinti arrived from Milan in the summer and has already made an impact. Rome has been home to Brazil’s centurion, Andressa, since 2019 while the experienced Austrian defender, Carina Wenninger, arrived on loan in the summer.

“There has been great work since the foundation of this club,” Spugna says. “Every year, we’ve been adding bits. This is a club made up of ambitious people with a great desire to improve.”

“The level has increased in Italy thanks to the advent of professional women’s teams. In the last two years, big international players landed in the Italian league and we are one of the clubs who have invested a lot in important players. The league continues to grow, but of course to get to the level of Lyon, Wolfsburg, Barcelona, Chelsea … it will still take time because they are ahead of us. We are trying to bridge this gap and I believe we are on the right track.”

As the women’s game continues to develop, a historic club such as Roma having a notable women’s side is key. They are a team that like to play on the front foot, but their manager is pragmatic about his side’s approach: “I like a team that dominates teams,” he says. “Domestically, we are managing to do this because we have a lot of quality … that’s what we are also trying to do in the Champions League. But of course, at this level, which is much higher, it’s not always possible and sometimes you have to defend.”

They are unbeaten in Europe this season, winning five of their seven matches. The highlight was that confidence-inducing draw with Wolfsburg, who they meet again on Thursday evening. “It meant a lot to us,” reflects Spugna. “Not only because of the final score, but because of the performance. We were brave on the pitch. We not only defended the result, but we tried to win the game.”

The pride Spugna feels is evident. However, he is not one to rest on his laurels with a clear focus to push Roma to the next level. “I landed in this big club and city, living a dream,” he says. “But now I’m here, I’m very happy and very proud. I’m happy that we’re doing good work, which is the most important thing. You need to keep doing this because in football, you need to forget what you did yesterday, and you need to focus on the future.”

All eyes on Manchester There was a new record attendance for Manchester United on Saturday. More than 30,000 supporters turned out at Old Trafford to enjoy their side’s thumping win over Aston Villa. All eyes will be on Manchester again next weekend. Over 40,000 tickets have been sold for the highly anticipated Manchester derby at the Etihad. With both sides in good form and mounting a title chase, could it be a significant game for the direction of the WSL?

The Theatre of Dreams has seen many a special goal in its time. Another was added to the list on Saturday as Ona Batlle brought the flair to Old Trafford in Manchester United’s 5-0 victory. Her thunderous effort from close range went in off the crossbar, giving Hannah Hampton no chance in the Aston Villa goal.

Quote of the week

“One thing that is clear is that you have to have some time off in football. That is important for any job, even if you love your job and it’s your passion and it’s what you want to do … it’s a deeply human thing where you need to switch off and reconnect …that is important in any workplace, and we need to acknowledge that” – Arsenal’s Jonas Eidevall on the importance of giving his players time off.

73,LTA fined $1m by ATP for banning Russian players from tournaments,"The Lawn Tennis Association has been fined $1m (£820,000) by the ATP for its ban on Russian and Belarusian players. It is also understood that the LTA has been threatened with expulsion from the Tour if it repeats the ban imposed this year due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Russians and Belarusians were controversially prevented from competing at the LTA’s five ATP events: Queen’s Club, Eastbourne, Surbiton, Nottingham and Ilkley.

The All England Club also banned them from playing at Wimbledon, which was subsequently stripped of its ranking points by the ATP and the WTA. The women’s tennis body had issued a fine of the same amount, which is being appealed against.

The LTA said it is considering its response to the latest sanction and accused the ATP of a “lack of empathy” over the situation in Ukraine. A statement read: “The LTA is deeply disappointed with this outcome. The ATP, in its finding, has shown no recognition of the exceptional circumstances created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or the international sporting community and UK Government’s response to that invasion.

“The ATP appear to regard this matter as a straightforward breach of their rules – with a surprising lack of empathy shown for the situation in Ukraine, and a clear lack of understanding of the unique circumstances the LTA faced.

“The financial impact of both this fine and the WTA’s fine will have a material impact on the LTA’s ability to develop and host tennis in this country.

“For example, we had intended to host a number of ATP Challenger level events to give more opportunities to lower-ranked players in the first quarter of 2023 and will now not be able to do this, particularly given the possibility of further fines.

“We will carefully consider our response and we await the outcome of our appeal against the WTA’s decision and sanction.”

In a statement, the culture secretary, Michelle Donelan, added: “Over the past year, the vast majority of the international sporting community have stood shoulder to shoulder in condemning Putin’s unprovoked and barbaric actions in Ukraine.

“The UK has taken a world-leading role to build this international response. We are clear that sport cannot be used to legitimise this deadly invasion, and that athletes representing the Russian or Belarusian states should be banned from competing in other countries.

“Despite widespread condemnation, the international tennis tours are determined to be outcasts in this, with investment in the growth of our domestic game hampered as a result.

74,"Manchester United have moved on from Cristiano Ronaldo, insists Erik ten Hag","Erik ten Hag insists Manchester United have moved on from Cristiano Ronaldo’s messy departure from the club last month.

Ten Hag was not willing to discuss the saga in depth when asked by the club’s in-house TV channel, MUTV, in an interview that was aired on Wednesday. Rather, the Dutchman insisted his focus was on the future as he looks to continue the rebuilding job at Old Trafford that he began when he arrived in the summer.

United terminated Ronaldo’s contract after being rocked by an extraordinary series of complaints by him in a TV interview. Ten Hag came in for particular criticism from the 37-year-old forward, who accused the Dutchman of not respecting him. Asked how he had managed the situation, Ten Hag told MUTV: “He’s gone and it’s the past. We are now looking forward and we’re looking to the future.”

United face Burnley in a Carabao Cup last-16 tie on 21 December before hosting Nottingham Forest in the Premier League six days later. Ten Hag is confident his squad will hit the ground running after breaking for the World Cup and said: “We had a plan, we have prepared the players with what the plan is, so there can’t be any confusion about what the programme is.

75,RFU sends Jones packing but English rugby’s problems won’t go with him,"Eight minutes to play and England are 14 points down against New Zealand. Will Stuart has just scored in the corner and Marcus Smith is standing over the conversion, on the 22, five metres in from the right touchline. It should be Owen Farrell’s kick.

Farrell, who has made every shot at goal so far in the autumn, 15 out of 15 in 200 minutes of Test rugby, is on the pitch, but struggling with a dead leg. So it falls to Smith. He strides up, leans back a touch too much as he swings his boot through and the ball flies wide, passing a couple of feet outside the right upright.

No one really noticed it in all the excitement of those final minutes, but that missed kick ended up the difference. Not that the draw was Smith’s fault, England wouldn’t have scored the three tries they needed to get back into the match without him. But England were a point away, which means, unless you believe the Rugby Football Union would have been brave enough to sack Eddie Jones after his team had beaten New Zealand, they were a gust of wind away from reaching a different decision.

A fortnight earlier, England were two points off beating Argentina. But for a wayward kick here and a wasteful penalty there England would have won three out of four this autumn.

England would still have played badly for long stretches of those same matches, would still have been battered against South Africa in the final game of the autumn, and beaten by Scotland, Ireland, and France in the Six Nations earlier in the year, but it is fair to ask if Jones would have been able to weather the end-of-series review that cost him his job on Tuesday if his team had picked up those three points against New Zealand and Argentina. Which is a desperately thin margin for any coach, let alone one with his track record.

Jones wasn’t let go just because of what happened in those two matches, he has made a series of escalating mistakes, the main one, as he said, that he let his focus drift too far ahead from the next game. He would have got away with rest of it, the flibbertigibbet selections, his ruthless way with his players and assistant coaches, his persistence with an attacking system that wasn’t really working, if the team had been winning in the meantime. But Jones was more caught up worrying about the next World Cup than whether they were ready for their next Test.

His insistence that everything would come good when the team got to France turned the future into a question of faith and the way the team had been playing meant there were too few people left willing to believe. It didn’t help that his ornery manner, and martinet bearing, meant he had made so many enemies along the way. By the end his own boss, the RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney, was one of them. You could hear Jones’s contempt when he told the press that Sweeney will make his decisions “based on what you guys write” after the loss to South Africa.

Sweeney has heard worse, not least at the recent hearings by the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, when he was accused by MPs of being “asleep on the job” and “failure on an epic scale” before being told he ought to “looking at his own position”. Apparently he decided to look at someone else’s instead. Really, the question isn’t how much confidence English rugby had in Jones so much as in the men who decided to sack him, 10 months out from a tournament for which he has spent the past three years preparing. Because wherever you come down on the coach, there’s no questioning what he has previously achieved in his job.

The RFU, on the other hand, seems oblivious to England’s history. This is a team who, before Jones took over, had not won a grand slam in 13 years, embarrassed themselves with their behaviour off the field in 2011 when they were beaten in the quarter-finals, and who were bundled out of their own tournament after being trounced by Australia in the pool stages in 2015. Jones’s England just about won as many matches as Brian Ashton’s, Martin Johnson’s and Stuart Lancaster’s did between them. Throw in Andy Robinson’s lot, too, and you find that under the four head coaches before Jones took over England won just over half the games they played.

How do you feel about Jones’s 73% now?

It figures that if you were going to sack the most successful coach you’ve had you wouldn’t do it unless you had a clear idea the man you were bringing in to replace him was going to be an improvement. Just like Wales did by firing Wayne Pivac and hiring Warren Gatland. So what is the RFU’s grand plan, exactly? Let’s check our notes. Oh yes, Jones’s own assistant, Richard Cockerill, is taking over while they work it out. There’s an expectation they will bring in Steve Borthwick from Leicester. Borthwick, who spent years working as Jones’s right-hand man and whose sum achievements without him are the Premiership title he won last season.

English rugby’s problems won’t end with Jones going. Anything but. Long after he has gone, and his replacement’s honeymoon is over, they might find that, if anything, Jones has spent years helping cover them up.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/dec/07/rfu-eddie-jones-packing-english-rugby-problems-wont-go-with-him,2022-12-07T00:00:00
76,Environmental leaders urge Democrats to drop deregulation bill,"Joe Biden and the Democratic party’s climate credentials will be severely undermined if controversial legislation to fast-track energy projects is latched on to a must-pass defense bill, environmental leaders have warned.

Progressive lawmakers and hundreds of climate, public health and youth groups are urging the Democratic leadership to stop the latest attempt by Joe Manchin, the West Virginia fossil-fuel-friendly senator, to force through legislation that would weaken environmental protections and expedite permits and construction of pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure while restricting public input.

According to the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, Biden supports including Manchin’s deregulation bill in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), an annual appropriations bill that will be voted on later this week. The final text of the proposed bill has not yet been published, but if pushed through as an appendage, it would lead to a sweeping decline in environmental protections and public participation without having been debated or scrutinized in committee hearings.

On Tuesday, more than 750 organizations sent a letter to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and congressional leadership opposing what they call a “cruel and direct attack on environmental justice communities”. If Pelosi permits the attachment of the dirty deal to the NDAA, it will be one of her final acts as speaker and threatens her credibility on climate, the groups said.

Manchin, who receives more campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry than any other lawmaker, also wants to limit legal challenges to new energy projects including the 303-mile Mountain Valley gas pipeline across the Appalachian mountains that has been stalled by concerned communities and environmental groups in West Virginia and Virginia.

He and other proponents have said that fast-track permitting is needed for a rapid transition to renewables and in order to modernize the country’s outdated power transmission systems.

But Jeff Merkley, the Democratic senator representing Oregon, said Manchin’s deal was a dirty one, and had nothing to do with renewables. “This [bill] will give a whole lot more impetus to fossil fuels and run over the top of ordinary people raising concerns, that’s why it’s a dirty deal. This is a real travesty in terms of legislative deliberation, and in terms of environmental justice.”

Rashida Tlaib, the Democratic congresswoman from Michigan, called on her colleagues to stand up against the fossil fuel industry and the undemocratic manner in which leadership was trying to push through the bill without scrutiny. “It’s outrageous enough that Congress wants to spend another $847bn on our military-industrial complex, the largest annual military budget in history; we cannot allow them to then ram through Manchin’s dirty deal in the process.”

Tlaib urged her colleagues to also vote no. “We cannot again remain silent while the fossil fuel industry continues to pollute our neighborhoods and sacrifice the health of our residents for their own endless greed,” she said.

Manchin’s bill, described by environmentalists as a “fossil fuel wishlist”, was first attached as a side deal to Biden’s historic climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, but was eventually thwarted after widespread opposition from progressive Democrats and civil society groups.

The latest effort has been condemned as a sneaky attempt to hijack defense appropriations. The NDAA is considered a must-pass bill because it authorizes pay increases and compensation for harmed troops, as well as establishing the following year’s personnel, arms purchasing and geopolitical policies.

Biden will not want another public battle with his own party, especially on climate action given that he is the self-proclaimed climate president, but opposition appears to be mounting and the results of a whip count will probably be out on Wednesday. If all Republicans vote against the policy, the House leadership can only afford to lose a handful of Democratic votes, according to Tlaib.

On Twitter Ilhan Omar, one of the most progressive members of Congress, said she would be voting against the NDAA if Manchin’s side deal was attached.

The fossil fuel industry is trying to sneak in a provision into the defense spending bill to make it easier to build pipelines, mines, and other dirty fossil fuel projects.



This is unacceptable and it’s why I’ll be voting NO on the rule to stop it. — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) December 6, 2022

As House leaders try to secure the votes, environmental and climate justice groups are warning Democrats that frontline communities would not forget, and would hold them accountable in 2024 if the deregulation bill was pushed through.

“To think that this is happening at the hands of Democrats, and their very last action of power is going to be to hurt our communities and strip our voice is really hurtful. I feel betrayed,” said Maria Lopez Nunez, deputy director of the New Jersey-based Ironbound Community Corporation who last week was appointed to the White House environmental justice advisory council.

“This is not how democracy works, and in our community we’re paying attention. So for any Democrat that’s listening, if you’re playing along to this charade, our community will call you out and we will hold you accountable. That goes for Democrats and Republicans.”

In the context of crop failures and food insecurity, due to extreme weather and dwindling diversity, as well as rising food prices exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine and the tight grip of corporate monopolies – Cop27 included the first ever day dedicated to food and climate.

Scientists are clear that the interconnected climate, environmental and food crises require bold transformative action to drastically reduce greenhouse gases and improve resilience. Food systems produce a third of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Cattle ranching is the main driver of Amazon rainforest loss, while industrialized food production is the biggest threat to 86% of the world’s species at risk of extinction.

But at Cop27, as in the debate more broadly, corporate interests dominated. Campaigners and NGOs say the food industry’s fingerprints were all over the solutions being touted, including an array of technologies and incentives that they say will do little to cut big food’s huge climate footprint, reduce diet-related diseases or increase food security and climate resilience in the long term.

“From treating cow burps to robotic weeders, none of the false solutions on offer at Cop27 come close to stopping the industrial food production from being an engine of planetary destruction,” said Raj Patel, food justice scholar and author of Stuffed and Starved. “Agribusiness and governments offered a series of patented patches designed not to transform the food system, but to keep it the same.”

There’s a lot still to unpick from Cop27, but here are some of the food “solutions” that experts told the Guardian they are most alarmed about:

1 The rise of ‘climate-smart agriculture’

The phrase “climate smart” – the mother of all buzzwords – has made its way into climate plans and policymaking, adopted by corporations, governments and multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank and FAO.

Billions of dollars are going into research on so-called climate-smart tech solutions such as robotics, AI, net zero dairy, cultivated meat and precision farming, including drones, GPS and drip-irrigation technologies. While proponents say these will increase productivity, help farmers adapt to the climate crisis, and cut emissions, critics say that the phrase “climate smart” has become an all-encompassing cover for rebranding harmful farm practices.

A key proponent of climate-smart agriculture is the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate initiative (Aim4C), a joint initiative spearheaded by the US and the UAE, which has promised $4bn in agricultural innovation to reduce emissions. It is supported by 40 countries and some of the world’s largest food companies including PepsiCo, the meat giant JBS and CropLife, an association of agrochemical companies. More than two-thirds of its partners are in the US or Europe, according to a DeSmog analysis, with not a single group representing Indigenous communities listed among its knowledge partners.

Aim4C has no clear plans to significantly slow or reduce activities such as industrial meat production and fertilizer use, which climate scientists say are fundamental to curbing global heating.

“AIM’s agritech solutions are not a strategy for 21st-century ecological change that benefits all of humanity and the web of life. Rather, this is more business as usual” said a spokesperson for the International Coalition on Climate and Agriculture, an alliance of activists and civil leaders.

2 Tech fixes for food’s giant methane problem

Methane is a short-lived but powerful heat-trapping gas that accounts for about a third of the rise in global temperature since the pre-industrial era. Livestock – through cattle burps, manure and the cultivation of feed crops – is responsible for nearly a third of global anthropogenic methane emissions, which is why scientists are clear that reducing meat and dairy consumption in the global north is essential to curbing global heating to 1.5C.

But the focus at Cop27 was not on changing human diets but rather cows’ diets – to make their burps less gassy.

There was much excitement from JBS, Nestlé, the world’s largest food and drinks company, and the meat and dairy trade groups about the boom in methane-reducing feed additives made from ingredients such as seaweed, ozone, enzyme inhibitors, green tea and garlic.

But the long-term risks and benefits of these emerging products remain unclear, and those currently on the market are only affordable to industrial cattle farmers and food companies that are invested in growing meat and dairy consumption, not reducing it.

“At best, these technologies provide a cover for the large meat and dairy corporations to continue overproducing on polluting factory farms,” said Amanda Starbuck, research director at Food and Water Watch.

3 Increasing access to fossil fuel-based fertilizers as the answer to food insecurity

The global food system is a heavy user of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, produced in an energy-intensive process reliant on fossil fuels. They are credited with helping to increase yields and reduce hunger, but their expansion has come at a huge cost to the environment, climate and human and animal health.

Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are responsible for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2022 study, which found that reducing their use “offers large mitigation potential” in addition to other health, environmental and economic benefits.

Yet curtailing synthetic fertilizers was not on the agenda at Cop27, rather the focus of industry reps and European and US officials was on fertilizer access and “efficiency” – helping farmers use increasingly costly nitrogen inputs in smarter ways.

The US, EU, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands announced $109m of public funds (plus $26m in private investment) to expand fertilizer access and efficiency to combat food insecurity.

But according to the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri: “Chemical fertilizers do not ensure food security. Their pervasive use sometimes increases crop production in the short term, but it creates a longer-term dependency on corporations and trade … the ultimate goal must be to wean them off this dependency as soon as possible.”

Branding fertilizer efficiency as climate action is further evidence of the industry controlling the narrative, said Lili Fuhr, deputy director for climate and energy at the Centre for Environmental Integrity. “Synthetic fertilizers are just fossil fuels in another form. Fertilizer companies know they will soon be under scrutiny and are trying to divert attention from production to more efficient use by the farmers.”

The fertilizer industry, which will benefit directly from the new taxpayer funded subsidies, is already booming: nine of the largest companies are expected to make $57bn profits in 2022 – up more than fourfold from 2020.

4 Industrial agriculture as the only way to feed a growing population

The industrial food sector pitches itself as the only way to feed a growing population. Yet small farmers (with less than two hectares) produce over a third of the world’s food – despite having access to only 12% of agricultural land. Much of the world’s population is either undernourished or overweight, suggesting that we are not producing or eating well.

Still, the momentum and the money seem to be skewed in favor of industrial agriculture, allowing it to continue to grow and emit. Almost 90% of the $540bn in global food subsidies, which play a big role in deciding what food is produced and what we eat, have been deemed “harmful” to the planet – by damaging health, the climate and nature as well as excluding smallholder farmers.

“Subsidies are a major change agent. They make it hard for farmers to make changes, and stop consumer-driven market changes from naturally taking place. This is not a level playing field,” said Stephanie Haszczyn from the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (Fairr) initiative.

Lower-impact forms of farming often receive little to no subsidy assistance. Proponents like La Via Campesina argue that agroecology – a form of farming steeped in Indigenous and ancestral knowledge that works with nature and local conditions to produce food sustainably, protecting biodiversity and soil quality – offers a viable greener, healthier and fairer alternative to big ag.

But neither subsidies nor agroecology were on the agenda at Cop27. “It was very disturbing to see a large contingent of corporate lobbyists influencing the process while small-scale farmers have been shut out and drowned out,” said Million Belay, an Ipes-Food expert and general coordinator of the Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa, a large grassroots movement. “Farmers demanded recognition for diverse, resilient farming, agroecology and climate finance, but they left with very little.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/07/false-food-solutions-experts-climate-cop27,2022-12-07T00:00:00
78,Sturgeon told Scotland’s climate targets are ‘in danger of being meaningless’,"Nicola Sturgeon has been warned Scotland’s highly ambitious climate targets are “in danger of being meaningless” because her government still has no clear plan to meet them.

The UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an official advisory body, said the Scottish government would almost certainly miss its world-leading carbon reduction targets for 2030 by a substantial margin, despite Sturgeon’s repeated promises of radical action on the climate.

In its annual report on Scotland’s climate strategy, the CCC said there were “glaring gaps” between its ambitions to cut emissions by 75% by 2030 and its success in meeting them. It was failing on farming, building emissions, recycling, peatland restoration and on cutting car use.

Lord Deben, the CCC’s chair, indicated growing irritation with the devolved government’s faltering progress, which has been the subject of repeated warnings from the committee.

“In 2019, the Scottish parliament committed the country to some of the most stretching climate goals in the world, but they are increasingly at risk without real progress towards the milestones that Scottish ministers have previously laid out,” Deben said.

“One year ago, I called for more clarity and transparency on Scottish climate policy and delivery. That plea remains unanswered.”

After the CCC’s criticisms last year – days after Sturgeon reiterated her pledges to be a world leader on climate at the Cop26 meeting in Glasgow – Scotland’s net zero secretary, Michael Matheson, said ministers were “resolutely focused” on delivering its promises. Sturgeon also brought the Scottish Green party into government last year and made both its co-leaders ministers, with a pledge to prioritise the climate.

The CCC’s latest report repeats many of last year’s criticisms but this time warns the first minister there is an “urgent need” for a dramatically accelerated and detailed strategy to get closer to meeting the 2030 targets.

Hitting that target was now “extremely challenging”. Emissions only dropped in 2020 because of the Covid crisis; as things stand, Scotland’s emissions would probably fall by 65% to 67%, leaving the country up to 8 megatonnes of CO 2 -equivalent short of its legally binding 75% target.

It also reported that if the climate impacts of Scotland’s consumption of imported goods and energy was included, the rates were 22% higher a head in Scotland than the UK average, at 13 tCO 2 e a person in 2018.

It found that:

Despite pledging to stop the sales of all petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030, sales of electric cars in Scotland had fallen behind England.

Scotland’s plans to rapidly decarbonise heating in buildings “were still wholly inadequate” despite recent funding increases.

Scottish ministers were failing to tackle high levels of meat and dairy consumption, key causes of CO 2 emissions from farming.

Scotland was meeting only half its target to restore 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) of peatland a year.

Scottish ministers were failing to work collaboratively with other UK governments on shared climate strategies.

Colin Smyth, Scottish Labour’s net zero spokesperson, said the report left the Scottish government’s “empty rhetoric in tatters. On the three biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions – transport, heat in buildings, and land use – the report card on the Green SNP government is a resounding fail, fail, fail.”

Matheson said the CCC’s report was “a timely reminder of the scale of the challenge faced by government, industry and civil society”, and said it would influence the government’s forthcoming climate strategy.

He insisted the government knew it had to dramatically step up its action. It was spending £1.8bn on decarbonising buildings, on renewables and on free buses for under-22s. “We are now entering the most challenging part of the journey to date, with a need to halve our emissions again within the next eight years,” he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/07/sturgeon-told-scotlands-climate-targets-are-in-danger-of-being-meaningless,2022-12-07T00:00:00
79,"Humanity has become ‘weapon of mass extinction’, UN head tells Cop15 launch","Humanity has become a weapon of mass extinction and governments must end the “orgy of destruction”, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said at the beginning of the biodiversity Cop15.

“We are out of harmony with nature. In fact, we are playing an entirely different song. Around the world, for hundreds of years, we have conducted a cacophony of chaos, played with instruments of destruction. Deforestation and desertification are creating wastelands of once-thriving ecosystems,” he said.

“Our land, water and air are poisoned by chemicals and pesticides, and choked with plastics … The most important lesson we impart to children is to take responsibility for their actions. What example are we setting when we ourselves are failing this basic test?

“The deluded dreams of billionaires aside, there is no Planet B,” Guterres told the opening ceremony of the conference in Montreal, Canada, where governments will begin formal negotiations for this decade’s UN biodiversity targets on Wednesday.

At the ceremony, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, urged countries to agree a target to conserve 30% of Earth for nature in the final agreement.

“We have not chosen that 30% number at random. It is the critical threshold according to the greatest scientists to avoid the risk of extinction and also to ensure our food and economic security. Thirty percent, that is quite feasible,” he said in a speech that was interrupted by protesters holding up a sign about the murder of Indigenous peoples.

Trudeau’s speech echoed the comments of Canada’s environment minister, Steven Guilbeault, a former environmental activist, who said the 30% aim would be equivalent to the 1.5C climate target, although this is strongly disputed by some scientists and activists.

The target, known as “30x30”, is the most high-profile proposal under consideration by governments for this decade’s agreement to protect biodiversity. Led by the UK, Costa Rica and France, it has the backing of a coalition of more than 100 countries but faces significant concerns from some Indigenous peoples and human rights campaigners, who warn it could legitimise further land grabs and violence against communities shown to best protect nature.

“We’re a big country with big ambitions,” said Guilbeault. “We’ve committed as a country to protect 30% of land and waters by 2030. We’re working in full partnership with Indigenous peoples, as well as provinces and territories.

“One might argue, and I guess I am, that our 1.5 degrees is protecting 30% of lands and oceans by 2030. It is the biodiversity equivalent of the 1.5 degrees on climate change. And I think that’s one of our collective goals [for this summit].”

Guilbeault made the comments at the opening press conference of the biodiversity summit today, where he appeared alongside the Cop15 president and China’s environment minister, Huang Runqiu; the UN’s biodiversity head, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema; and Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN environment programme.

Mrema and Andersen said the summit could have big consequences for tackling emissions from land, the second-largest human source of greenhouse gases after burning fossil fuels.

“If we look at the recent disasters – floods, drought, heatwaves, wildfires – yes, we always say it’s because of climate change,” said Mrema. “But where are these disasters that happen? They all happen in ecosystems. It is clear that unless we protect and restore biodiversity, climate warming will continue to rise. And we may fail to reach the 1.5 degrees.”

Ahead of formal negotiations for the agreement at Cop15, which begin tomorrow, talks received a significant boost from the EU as the bloc agreed a ban on all products judged to have contributed to deforestation. The world’s second-largest importer of agricultural product made the rules, which will affect the trade in cattle, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, rubber, soya and wood products, all linked to the loss of tropical forests.

“This legislation is a gamechanger for the world’s forests,” said the Mighty Earth CEO Glenn Hurowitz. “For the first time, European governments are telling companies selling agricultural goods, ‘If you or your suppliers destroy forests, you can’t sell your products here.’ With this law, Europe is putting real action for wildlife on the table.”

However, Hurowitz cautioned that there were gaps in the legislation, including a failure to protect Indigenous rights and other important non-forest ecosystems such as peatlands.

Talks in Canada are scheduled to conclude on 19 December but are likely to overrun, with significant divisions between governments already evident at pre-Cop negotiations, which took place over the weekend.

At the opening press conference on Tuesday, Huang said China took its role in helping countries forge a final agreement seriously, noting that it had been a hard decision to move the talks from Kunming, China, due to the pandemic.

81,"‘Join the club’: Stephen King, Margaret Atwood and more reassure debut author after lonely book launch","When debut author Chelsea Banning vented on Twitter about no one showing up at her book signing, she didn’t expect that some of the world’s most famous authors, including Stephen King, Margaret Atwood and Neil Gaiman, would respond with tales of their own nightmare public appearances.

“At my first Salem’s Lot signing, I had one customer. A fat kid who said, ‘Hey bud, do you know where there’s some Nazi books?’” King wrote to her.

“Terry Pratchett and I did a signing in Manhattan for Good Omens that nobody came to at all. So you are two up on us,” Gaiman wrote.

“Join the club,” Atwood wrote. “I did a signing to which nobody came, except a guy who wanted to buy some Scotch tape and thought I was the help.”

Banning had arrived at Pretty Good Books in Ashtabula, Ohio, on the weekend for the event to launch her debut novel, Of Crowns and Legends. She was hoping that most of the 37 people who had RSVPed would show – but only two people turned up. They were both her friends.

“Kind of upset, honestly,” she tweeted afterwards, “and a little embarrassed.”

Only 2 people came to my author signing yesterday, so I was pretty bummed about it. Especially as 37 people responded ""going"" to the event. Kind of upset, honestly, and a little embarrassed. — Chelsea Banning Author (@chelseabwrites) December 4, 2022

Speaking to the Guardian a few days later, Banning said: “I was pretty bummed, honestly. I was happy to see the two that did, as they are my friends, and we had a good time chatting for a bit, but it was disheartening after a while and realising no one else was coming.”

But within hours of posting her tweet, bestselling authors were lining up to share similar stories.

“I have sat lonely at a signing table many times only to have someone approach … and ask me where the bathroom is,” Jodi Picoult wrote.

“Once sat out front of mall bookshop for a signing,” bestselling crime author Linwood Barclay wrote. “No one stopped, until the very end, when an old guy paused, looked at me, looked at the books, looked at me, approached and asked, ‘Do they sell flags here?’”

“I did a book reading where only my husband’s cousin showed up. One person. I’ll never forget that reading,” Pachinko author Min Jin Lee wrote.

“Ooh, boy, too many to share. The one where the bookshop staff kindly pretended to be customers so I wouldn’t feel too bad, that stays with me,” One Day author David Nicholls wrote. “I should also add – don’t be downhearted, it’s a kind of rite of passage that happens to everyone, and congratulations on the book!”

“I was once invited to a crime writers’ festival. Colin Dexter was on at the same time. Only one person showed up for me. We chatted for a while and I told him how glad I was that he’d come,” wrote Jonathan Coe. “He said, ‘Actually I’m Ian Rankin and I was supposed to be introducing you.’”

The thread began to spread even wider than names in literature. “That is the beginning,” actor Henry Winkler wrote. “Then word gets out and they come!”

“YO,” rapper Flavor Flav wrote to her. “Here to hype up ya next signing!”

The warm response moved Banning to tears and completely changed how she feels about the lonely signing. “I feel elated!” she said. “And excited and definitely reassured. I’m not even upset about no one coming – I heard back from a lot of them, and they or their families ended up getting sick.”

She has since had almost 500 orders placed for digital copies of her book, and it has shot up Amazon’s charts.

82,Creepy behavior or pop performance? 1975’s Matty Healy reignites debate about onstage kissing,"The 1975’s tour has been a spectacle of manufactured chaos, most of it courtesy of the band’s frontman, Matty Healy. The sets have delivered a feast of made-for-TikTok moments. The singer has subjected fans to everything from onstage push-ups to yelling at security through an auto-tuned microphone. He’s even risked a tapeworm by eating raw meat on stage. But the biggest buzz comes from his seemingly most-beloved trick: kissing fans. (One hopes he does this before consuming the ribeye.)

As clips posted on Twitter and TikTok show, Healy has invited men and women to smooch. In avoidance of rock music’s dismal history of consent, he has made a point of asking fans if they’d like to “snog” before going in for the kiss, with Isabella, a 24-year-old bartender from Dallas, tweeting “he ASKED before he kissed me” and adding in an interview that Healy said “we don’t have to snog if you don’t want to” to her before she fully consented to the kiss. Austin, from San Diego, wrote on Twitter that his make-out was “an insane experience” that “made [him] feel something [he] couldn’t fully put into words”.

Kissing fans on stage isn’t exactly new territory for pop stars. Elvis Presley’s 70s performances found the crooner kissing just about every woman in the room when he performed Love Me Tender. Diamond Dogs-era David Bowie made it a part of his shtick. Bono has been cozying up to fans at arena tours for years. It’s not even the first time for Healy: fans said he did the same during a 2014 tour, and again at a 2019 Dubai show to protest against the country’s anti-LGBTQ+ stance.

“Pulling a fan out of the audience to kiss them enacts a kind of fantasy, and it’s a pretty time-worn trope,” said Jack Hamilton, an associate professor of cultural studies at the University of Virginia and author of Just Around Midnight: Rock and Roll and the Racial Imagination. “If you think about the crooner tradition or the singing of love songs, it’s nothing new for people to have crushes on stars. Kissing someone on stage is the literal fulfillment of that fantasy.”

But the fulfillment of fantasy relies on consent. In 2019, footage from 2010 surfaced showing Drake kissing and groping a 17-year-old girl (when the rapper learned her age, he sent her back, and admonished her: “Why do you look like that?”).

This year, Enrique Iglesias posted a video showing him kissing and fondling a woman at a meet-and-greet; some fans bashed the singer for his behavior, noting that he’s been in a partnership with the tennis player Anna Kournikova since 2001.

Healy’s make-outs occur in full view of fans, who post their footage to social media. “It seems like a relatively safe space that’s documented, part of the performance and part of the act,” said Theo Cateforis, an associate professor of music history at Syracuse University. “The creepy behavior [from musicians] tends to be private and out of the public’s view.”

Eva Walker, who plays in the band the Black Tones and DJs for the alternative Seattle radio station KEXP, says her two rules for onstage antics are: “Don’t hurt anyone, and ask first.” She remembers a show she played in her early 20s, when a woman came up after her and asked for a kiss. When she obliged, the woman’s girlfriend ran over, angry. “I thought, ‘Oh, no,’ and then I asked, ‘Would you like a kiss too?’ And her mood changed, she was so happy and said ‘Oh yeah.’ So I kissed the girlfriend and everyone lived happily ever after.”

Healy’s behavior is nothing new to these artists. “As long as there’s consent, it can be entertaining,” Walker said. “It seems like if there is an ethical rockstar way to be sleazy on stage, [Healy] found it. Both parties seemed happy. I hope the days are over of the damsel in distress, bend her down and kiss her thing, because that’s how you get punched in the face.”

JNA, a Seattle-based disco artist, says the audience doesn’t need to know whether she has previous with the person she kisses on stage. “It’s one of those rock’n’roll tricks that’s a tale as old as time,” she says. When she performs, she often asks her husband to stand near the stage. “I tell him, ‘I need you to be right here, because I’m not going to touch anybody else, but I’ll be sexy with you and no one in the crowd knows you’re my husband. But when I was younger, I was definitely front and center, ready for someone to pull me onstage. That’s why we go to shows when we’re young.”

No matter how ideas about consent and boundaries have evolved, the prototypical pop star still holds a particular place in the collective imagination. “There is still a pretty resilient set of assumptions about how pop stars have license to behave in ways that the rest of us don’t,” said Steve Waksman, associate professor of music and American studies at Smith College. “They are allowed to act out things that we aren’t allowed to do ourselves.”

In a way, Healy’s kisses can seem less like a spontaneous transgression and more of a carefully planned piece of choreography – especially when the same script is repeated night after night.

“Kissing a single fan in the context of an arena show allows for a moment of intimacy that everyone can share,” Waksman said. “It’s a way to break the fourth wall, and even if it’s cheesy, pop is a realm of these types of grand gestures.”",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/06/the-1975-matty-healy-kissing-fans,2022-12-06T00:00:00
83,"Slashers, demons and head exploders: why horror revels in modern architecture","The Ikon Gallery in Birmingham is an old Victorian school that was turned inside out and filled with new modernist interiors in the late 1990s. It looks to the untrained eye like a place of dusty classrooms and tiled corridors, but inside you’ll find glass stairwells and white cube gallery spaces. Around you, nearly everything is modern. Ikon stands in one of the first New Labour urban regeneration showpieces – Brindleyplace, all chain cafes, pristine lawns and squares, and canalside office blocks. It is privately secured and patrolled, managed apart from the rest of the city. Nothing is allowed to go wrong; nothing is quite what it seems; nothing is real. It’s an appropriately uneasy place for Horror in the Modernist Block, a show aiming to explore the perhaps obscure links between modern architecture and horror.

Horror is generally about the irrational. It is a matter of things that do not exist – ghosts, vampires, zombies – and about how the brain manufactures terrors for itself in situations where you’re usually entirely safe. It’s also, often, about the past: the revenants and spectres left over from an earlier, apparently less enlightened age. Accordingly, a “haunted house” is usually not cubic and made of steel and concrete. But terror has certainly happened in modern buildings. In fact, the terms used to be all-but-synonymous for tabloid headline writers who, from the 70s to 90s, filled their pages with stories about ghastly scenes of murder and social dysfunction in high-rise social housing estates, and branded London’s Trellick Tower the Tower of Terror (flats there now sell for more than £1m).

But merely being frightened by things is not quite the same as horror, and there was usually nothing particularly supernatural about tabloid crime stories set in “sink estates” – as if the architecture does not lend itself to the mindset of real horror. This is not coincidental. The reason why a “haunted house” tends to be old and gothic isn’t just the fact that its floorboards might have a satisfyingly eerie creek, but because there is so much unseen in a Victorian house. Originally, every surface will have been covered in doilies, rugs, throws and carpets, and everything from table legs to dinner services will have been richly ornamented; moreover, there were places you weren’t meant to see, from the servants’ quarters below to half-forgotten attics within steep pitched roofs.

In the 1920s, all that was suddenly swept away, for a kind of house that would be a rational “machine for living in”, with no past, and a present without dust, dirt or dark corners. The sentimentality, superstitious religiosity and brutal inequality of the 19th-century city would be swept away in favour of logical, egalitarian, clear-eyed cities. Walter Benjamin praised this new modernist architecture – the right-angled, glassy, clean modernist houses of Le Corbusier or Mies van der Rohe – for constructing places where you could not leave traces. That is, these were houses without ghosts.

Horror in the Modernist Block showcases artists examining the ways in which these buildings can be eerie and alienating. For instance, in Kihlberg and Henry’s film Slow Violence or artist NT’s film BRUTAL, Birmingham’s high-rise estates and new luxury living enclaves are looming and sinister; Firenze Lai’s paintings stress the confining, claustrophobic nature of Hong Kong’s high-rise housing; Ho Tzu Nyen’s video The Cloud of Unknowing stages the ghostly invasion of a Singapore public housing estate and the demonic possession of its residents on the eve of its demolition; and in Maria Taniguchi’s Mies 421, the opulent marble and chrome volumes of Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Pavilion are rendered depopulated and sinister. Arguably, all of these have their roots in the way that some horror film directors, not satisfied with the tired tropes of gothic mansions, have found horror in concrete.

Probably the first horror films to explore modernist spaces as the scenes of appalling crimes were the Italian giallo slashers of the 1970s and early 1980s. Made during the political chaos of the “Years of Lead”, these films frequently took place in the high-modernist interiors of executive apartment blocks or private houses in the rich cities of northern Italy. The lurid reds and oranges of Verner Panton furniture, and the sharp edges of glass coffee tables, became a new vocabulary of horror, places where the human body was sliced up by the hard lines of modern design.

In giallo films, violence is treated with the same fastidious attention to detail as the layout of a Bauhaus home – something that makes them perfect Instagram fodder. The most dramatic example of giallo modernism comes in Dario Argento’s 1982 film Tenebrae, which mostly takes place in a remarkably unnerving brutalist house: the Villa Ronconi in the suburbs of Rome, designed by Saverio Busiri Vici in the early 70s. Its concrete grid is organised in such a complex fashion that inside and outside are completely scrambled, an apt setting for this story of a media-inspired serial killer.

The great director of modernist horror is David Cronenberg. His early features consistently used the brutalist buildings of his native Canada as the offices for sinister laboratories and corporations undertaking various appalling experiments. In Shivers, a parasitic STD is let loose on the residents of Nun’s Island, an impeccably rational, Mies van der Rohe-designed steel and glass grid of luxury flats in Montreal; in The Brood, experiments that will lead to a woman producing murderous mutant children take place in the secluded, forested Somafree Institute of Psychoplasmics (filmed at the Kortright Centre for Conservation, outside Toronto); and in Scanners, psychic adolescents are trained to explode their enemies’ heads at the offices of ConSec, which is actually the Futur Electronique Building on the outskirts of Montreal, an enigmatic brutalist block surrounded by nothing.

For Cronenberg, a peculiar if orthodox Freudian, these modernist spaces are all attempts to make rational creatures out of human beings whose minds and bodies are ungovernable and terrifying. His scientists’ attempts to create logic only release chaos.

Any depiction of horror in the modernist block, however, has to reckon with Candyman, Bernard Rose’s audacious horror classic on race and class in Chicago through the tale of a mythical, supernatural killer. Candyman has surely launched a thousand PhD theses – appropriately, for a film about academics – but at the heart of it is a return of the repressed in two modernist housing estates.

Graduate student Helen Lyle lives in a gorgeous high-rise flat in Lincoln Village (this is in fact Carl Sandburg Village, which, like its fictional equivalent, is a 1960s social housing project that was privatised and turned into condominiums). She becomes obsessed with the urban legend of the Candyman: the murderous ghost of Daniel Robitaille, a black painter who was tortured and lynched for forming a relationship with a white woman in the 1890s. He was killed, we are told, on the future site of Cabrini-Green Homes, an estate of red-brick and concrete grids just outside the city centre that was by then the most notorious modernist failure in the US (opened in 1957, the buildings were demolished in the 00s, and replaced with private housing). One of these high-rise estates, we are shown, can be viewed from the windows of the other.

Long before brutalist buildings became the objects of niche tourism, Helen goes on queasily voyeuristic excursions to Cabrini-Green to document the horrifically dilapidated towers, and their devastated surroundings – startlingly close to the shiny Miesian glass skyscrapers of the city centre – to take photographs and collect stories. Finding herself in what residents claim is the home of the Candyman, she is in an appalling refraction of her own spacious modernist condo, coated in graffiti, riddled with vermin, with its glass windows obscured by chicken wire. Outside Lincoln Village are tree-lined paths, benches and elegant 60s light-fittings, all covetable by today’s modernism enthusiasts; outside Cabrini-Green are parking lots, freeways and a towering pile of waste. They’re the same place, subjected to a radically different fate.

Unlike the accounts of modernist housing that see it as something intrinsically alienating and sinister, Candyman’s satire is not aimed at the buildings; as the contrast shows, they can be whatever we want them to be. Rather, it is a ferocious attack on the ways in which architecture is wrapped up in the US’s monstrous inequalities of race and class. The legacies of slavery and what is not so much a legacy as a present of stark segregation continue to haunt the modernist blocks because their horrors have never actually ended. The two high-rise estates in the film are a perfect synecdoche for a system that can make a utopia and dystopia out of exactly the same design, depending on what class or race the residents were born into.

Here is the true irrationality, and the Candyman is an avenging, silky-voiced angel floating across both sides of the tracks. On the other side of the office blocks of Brindleyplace, visible from the Ikon Gallery, are the high-rise estates of Ladywood, one of the poorest places in the UK. Just like Helen Lyle, you can stare from the windows of one towards the other. As the Candyman trills to her: “I am the writing on the wall.”

Horror in the Modernist Block is at Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, until 1 May.

84,‘Someone will get whipped – the white men’: the amazing period drama that rewrites stories of slavery,"‘I will not confess to something I don’t believe I have done.” Frannie Langton is a maid who has been charged with the murders of her masters after waking up in a dress soaked in blood. She can’t piece together what really happened, but she swears innocence. “I’m fed up of people like you deciding who I am or what I am as soon as you take one look at me,” she growls at her legal brief, who, like everybody else, assumes she did it. And with that, The Confessions of Frannie Langton promises one hell of a gutsy story.

Set in the 19th century, the programme stars Karla-Simone Spence as Frannie, who grew up on a plantation in Jamaica, then was brought to England and given to Marguerite (Sophie Cookson) and George Benham (Stephen Campbell Moore). “No doubt you’re thinking this will just be another one of those slave histories all sugared over with misery and despair,” she narrates. “It won’t be.” Indeed, this is a story about love; an unexpected and illicit affair with Marguerite (or “Madam”, as Frannie calls her).

Could Frannie really have killed her lover? Then again, who would believe a queer Black woman with an opium addiction? Over four episodes of flashbacks, twists, turns and cliffhangers, the truth will out. Hopefully.

Sara Collins, author of the award-winning novel that provided the source story, usually hates it when books are turned into TV. “They don’t tend to work,” she says from her home. “I’ve never loved an adaptation as much as the book.” That’s a fair enough opinion but it prompts the question: why did she say yes to adapting her own debut novel? “I fought myself about whether to do it,” she says. “But it would have been ridiculous to turn it down.” She has since taken quite the U-turn: “I want people to say: ‘Holy shit, that was good.’”

The success of the book and turnaround of the adaptation was rapid: after being published in 2019, The Confessions of Frannie Langton won the Costa first novel award months later, then was optioned the following year. Spence says she didn’t even get a chance to read it until the third round of auditions – and it made her sob. “Frannie is just fighting to tell her story,” she says.

Collins had never written a screenplay before, so she “tackled it like a lawyer” – probably because that was her profession. “I had to persuade myself I knew what I was doing,” she says. “I created a lot of colour-coded files. It felt a lot like going to court.”

Such a methodical approach makes sense; there’s a lot going on in this story. It’s a whodunnit period drama that encompasses slavery, queer romance, race and addiction. Collins, though, rejects such labels: “I don’t see it as an LGBT novel and I don’t see it as a Black novel … it’s just a story about human beings.” The relationship between Frannie and Marguerite, she says, was the only thing that made sense. “When you think about who else was around – incredibly odious men … If I were in that household, Madam would have been the only option for me!”

Still, the fact is that stories with Black female leads are rare in period drama. With gothic romance classics such as Rebecca, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights being big influences, Collins wanted to put a Black woman centre stage. The era she chose was specifically between 1807 – the UK’s abolition of the international slave trade – and 1833, the emancipation, which gradually set all enslaved people free. “That was a good chance to put our memory of the empire on trial,” says Collins.

As Frannie’s tale unravels, we discover that she learned to read while growing up on the Jamaican plantation and was educated by her master, the irksome John Langton (Steven Mackintosh), who enlisted her help with his horrific “scientific research”. Although Frannie was a slave, Spence says she “had certain freedoms in terms of having more of a say in things – she felt she was higher stationed than everyone else.” So when Langton takes her to London, the reality of her captivity hits, especially when she hears of other Black people who have lived under their roof. “You people think you can come here and snatch the bread from an Englishman’s mouth!” shouts the housekeeper, who quickly puts Frannie to work.

The relationship with Marguerite, which fires up over a shared love of literature, is doomed from the off. She, too, is an oppressed woman married to an ogre out of convenience and unable to express her true intellect and talents. But, as Collins puts it, she has “an incredible privilege she’s not aware of. She’s so consumed with self-pity that she’s incapable of understanding another person’s pain.”

If it sounds bleak, that’s because it is. There is one woman in Frannie’s life, however, whose loyalty never falters and who is sure to become a fan favourite: her friend Sal (Amarah-Jae St Aubyn), who runs a nearby brothel. “Being with Sal is the only time Frannie can be vulnerable,” says Spence, who adores the “big sister” character.

For Collins, Sal was a way of exploring the number of Black women who were famously independent and self-sufficient sex workers in the 19th century. “It subverts what we expect,” says Collins, “a Black woman in financial and emotional control. It’s a playful wink to what you expect from a slavery story: someone is going to get whipped but you don’t realise it’s going to be the white men.”

Ultimately, though, this is a great gothic romance. “It’s a love story as dark and twisted as the murders that happen at the end,” says Collins, who happily likens it to a “juicier” Jane Eyre (“if Jane had shagged the woman in the attic … ”). Spence sums it up with Frannie’s own words to Madam: “Men write so that they can separate themselves from history – but women write to join it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/07/someone-will-get-whipped-the-white-men-the-amazing-period-drama-that-rewrites-stories-of-slavery,2022-12-07T00:00:00
85,Infinite lives: the company saving old arcade machines,"On a rural industrial estate five miles outside Honiton, under the flight path of a nearby aerodrome, sits a rather nondescript warehouse. Only one feature marks it out: in front is a graveyard of stripped arcade cabinets, slowly rotting in the cold and damp.

I am here to visit Play Leisure, a company that restores and sells old arcade games. It has a compelling TikTok account where it shares new discoveries – a recent post showed off a Deadstorm Pirates machine with its enormous sit-in cabinet and giant cinematic display. I’ve dragged my friend and fellow arcade fanatic Joao Sanches along, and now I’m feeling nervous and responsible because, walking up to the unmarked entrance, I’ve no idea if they will have anything interesting in stock after our 90-minute drive.

But peering inside, I spot it immediately, sat there in the cramped reception area amid piles of cardboard boxes: a pristine 1992 Street Fighter II machine, the backboard sporting a wild illustration of Ryu kicking Ken, each special feature on the playfield named after famous Street Fighter attacks. I almost gasp.

Matt Conridge, the owner of Play Leisure, has always been interested in arcade machines. “Like a lot of us in our 30s and 40s, it comes from back when I was a kid,” he explains as he comes to greet us. “I used to visit arcades at seaside resorts – places like Dawlish and Lynmouth.”

‘It comes from back when I was a kid’ … Matt Conridge, the owner of Play Leisure. Photograph: Joao Diniz Sanches

Three years ago, Conridge was running a video game bar in Bideford, north Devon, when Covid hit. Facing disaster, he decided to close up and use his contacts in the arcade scene to pivot into a new project: restoration. He rented a warehouse, employed a small team of specialist engineers and started buying up all the old coin-ops he could get his hands on. The plan was to repair them and sell them on to private collectors and retro theme bars, after the pandemic.

“Back then, we were only buying small quantities so it usually came from collectors. Now we take them on an industrial scale,” says Conridge. “At the moment, with what’s happening in the economy, arcades are cutting costs, getting rid of some of the lower performing machines that cost them more to run than they make in revenue. We get clearances from arcades, play centres, trampoline parks … ”

Another problem is that older coin-ops require specialist engineers to maintain them. “A lot of the people who used to build and service these machines have retired,” says Conridge. “That knowledge is dying.”

Matt takes us through to the main warehouse space, where we’re momentarily stunned again. Crammed into a space about the size of a tennis court are 200-odd arcade machines from throughout gaming history. The first thing I spot is the twin cabinet version of Sega’s brilliant 1995 racing game Manx TT Super Bike, which allowed players to sit on reproduction motorcycles and compete against each other along narrow country lanes. Nearby there’s Konami’s thrilling Silent Scope 2: Fatal Judgement, complete with its authentic sniper rifle controller, and further back in this electronic labyrinth is a twin cab of Final Furlong, the crazy Namco horse racing game that you control by sitting on a plastic horse and jumping up and down.

I’m taken back to the first time I visited Japan in 2000 to attend the Tokyo Game Show. I walked into an arcade in Akihabara and saw salarymen on their lunch hour, dozens of them in rows playing this game, grimacing with effort in the darkness.

The machines arrive in huge shipping containers and Conridge is never quite sure what games he’ll find or what condition they will be in. “The problem is, arcade operators don’t generate any more money by keeping machine internals clean,” he says. “If you open it up and start cleaning the inside you may end up causing issues. We’ve opened them and found coins, tools … We found a porno mag in the back of a machine once. We’ve just got one from Blackpool, a crane machine that dispensed sweets – it’s been left for a few years and the sweets have fallen inside and rotted, then the flies got in there … ugh.”

Will they clean that? “No,” laughs Conridge. “We’ll sell it off and let someone else deal with it.”

Conridge is however, conscientious about whom he sells brittle older machines to. “There are some retro machines that we advise people not to buy unless they’re technically minded,” he says. “There’s a pinball machine, a 1966 electromechanical model we’re just about to put on sale, and we’ll refuse to sell that to nine out of 10 people who contact us because we know it won’t be suitable for them. These machines are like classic cars: they are specialist pieces of equipment and need constant care. If I sell it to someone who just wants a working machine, they’ll be fed up after five minutes – we’ve got to choose the right customer for it. Someone who is able to tinker.”

It’s not just ancient pinball machines that are problematic. The big video arcade games of the 1990s – the technical peak of the industry – often used proprietary hardware that is simply impossible to replace or reproduce. “The Sega Model arcade boards used custom Lockheed Martin chips, which you just can’t source. We have to decide whether to harvest parts from less interesting games and use them to resupply classics like Sega Rally.” Around the outskirts of the warehouse space, there are shelves groaning under the weight of esoteric parts, haphazardly piled or collected in boxes.

Adding to the value of these machines now is the fact that arcades historically dumped old units when they stopped being profitable. “Ten to 15 years ago companies just didn’t foresee that there would be any interest from collectors,” says Conridge. “We just sold an Addams Family pinball machine for £10,000 – that would have been chucked in a skip 15 years ago. People didn’t expect anyone would want them.”

This was especially true of larger speciality machines, such as rhythm action games, with their bulky floor pads and complicated controllers, and driving games with their realistic race car cabinets. Not only did they take up valuable floor space, they were expensive to maintain. Their growing rarity represents an interesting challenge for Play Leisure, because games like Dance Mania and Guitar Hero are exactly the sorts of machines that the new era of retro gaming bars – such as the NQ64 chain, which has just taken on £2m of funding – are looking for: not only are they fun to play in a bar environment, they’re fun to watch, too. “Dance Mania is now a £3k machine,” Conridge says.

When cabinets arrive, their condition is assessed. For Conridge there is a delicate balance between restoration and preservation. He shows me a Point Blank machine that’s just come in: Namco’s entertaining light gun shooter, which was also popular on the PlayStation, is a currently a hit with buyers. He will aim to repair these machines whatever state they arrive in – even though the guns themselves, with their delicate recoil mechanic, are often busted beyond repair (“they get really smashed by kids in the arcade”).

On this cabinet, the lavishly illustrated decals on the sides are peeling off: do they change the artwork for a modern reproduction? “If we do, it will look better but it won’t be original,” says Conridge. “It’s a challenge. We don’t tend to sell perfect-looking machines. When we went into arcades as children, the machines would have cigarette burns – that’s how you remember them. There’s a certain charm to that.

‘I almost gasp’ … classic arcade game Street Fighter II. Photograph: Joao Diniz Sanches

Some arcade cabinets are not economically viable to repair, but that doesn’t mean they’re unsellable. “We sell quite a lot of project machines,” he says. “For a collector working in their garage, that’s fine. We had a Star Wars 1982 Atari machine come in about 14 months ago. We put it on TikTok and Facebook – someone rang and they were desperate for it. It was nice to save this original machine from being scrapped.”

If they can’t be repaired, they’re stripped for parts: circuit boards, cathode ray monitors, joysticks, motors. Almost none of these are manufactured any more, so they’re all saved. Even completely stripped cabinets can have value: people often use them as a shell for their own arcade machines, using a PC and LED monitor. “Our customers can be really creative,” says Conridge. “We have people turning them into cocktail cabinets, stands for DVD players and games consoles. It’s nice because they’re not ending up in a landfill site – they’re getting another life.”

Conridge reckons half his machines go to retro bars and modern arcades. The rest are bought by private collectors. There’s a highly active arcade-collecting community, based around Discord servers and forums such as UKVAC, and Covid brought in a lot of new customers who started building gaming dens in the midst of lockdown.

Besides retro pinball tables and 1990s hits, the big sellers are attached to film or TV licences. Play Leisure has sold three Star Wars Battle Pods, really big immersive machines, for £10,000 each. An Aerosmith-branded arcade game named Revolution X will sell for £1,500, an X-Files pinball table for £3,500. There’s an odd market too for old coin-pushing machines, mostly thanks to the TV quiz show Tipping Point and the growing popularity of TikTok accounts that specialise in coin-pushing live streams.

Joao and I spend the whole day here, snaking between the machines, peering into their exposed innards. We photograph everything. A long time ago we worked together on the video game magazine Edge, often reporting on arcade shows – these machines, which are now antiques, were the newest, hottest tech when we started our careers.

And before that, as a kid, I hung out in arcades in the 1980s. Donkey Kong, Defender, Space Harrier, Out Run; a pocket full of 10 pence coins, a whole day to waste. It is bittersweet to see the machines here, their CRT monitors cracked or missing, light gun holsters worn and split.

It is good that these things are being saved. To many of us, these are more than just disposable commercial products: they are works of art containing within them the experiences of thousands of players, my own included.",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/dec/07/infinite-lives-the-company-saving-old-arcade-machines,2022-12-07T00:00:00
86,Top 10 polar photobooks,"As a former biologist turned natural history film-maker, I’ve been lucky enough to visit the polar regions – both the Arctic and Antarctic – on quite a number of occasions. From an initial science cruise with the British Antarctic survey to months in the Canadian Arctic filming marine animals and local people for the first Frozen Planet, and a remarkable expedition to Zavodovski Island, the largest penguin colony in the world, these visits have been extraordinary experiences. Far from being remote and hostile, these are places that get under your skin, that leave you breathless with the beauty of our planet, warmed by the welcome of local communities, and touched by the naive curiosity of some of its most characterful animals.

In finding stories for television from such remote lands, we often rely on the images captured by photographers and scientists working in these extremes. Their first-hand knowledge informs us of new science and what we may find if we take a film trip there.

For Frozen Planet II we’ve filmed across the whole of Earth’s frozen lands – not just the polar regions, but the high mountains, cold steppe regions and even cold deserts that pepper all seven continents of the world. The book that accompanies the series draws on some of the remarkable imagery – not just that captured while filming the series, but from some of the incredible photographers we spoke to and worked with along the way. When I return from my travels I love to delve into my own shelves of books from these icy lands. These are some of my favourites:

Svalbard Norway, pictured in Born to Ice by Paul Nicklen. Photograph: Paul Nicklen

1. Born to Ice by Paul Nicklen

One of the best-known photographers of the polar world, Nicklen grew up in the Canadian Arctic before becoming a National Geographic photographer and his images from decades of visits to both poles – along with his personal story – provide a fabulous body of imagery for some armchair polar exploring. Beyond its photographic merit, and the clear love it shows for the landscape and wildlife, you can feel Nicklen’s passion to protect these fragile lands.

2. Under Antarctic Ice by Norbert Wu

Beneath Antarctica’s Ross Sea is a truly otherworldly landscape where giant amphipods, vibrantly colourful sea stars and sea spiders the size of dining plates wander the seabed of an ice-covered world. Wu was one of the first photographers who gained access to this incredible location by working with the US National Science Foundation. His images were the first I had ever seen of this rich yet alien landscape – its colour and strangeness in total contrast to the seemingly desolate white wilderness of the continent beyond.

Exquisite … an image from Adélie, Terre & Mer by Laurent Ballesta and Vincent Munier Photograph: Laurent Ballesta

3. Adélie, Terre & Mer by Laurent Ballesta and Vincent Munier

This incredible two-volume, large-format photo collection showcases the work of French nature photographers Ballesta and Munier, who explored on and under the pack ice of the Adélie coast in Antarctica. The result is a beautiful showcase that captures the almost monochrome landscape. Munier’s volume explores the pack ice and bird colonies, often placing his subjects like silhouettes in the vastness of their snowbound landscapes, while Ballesta explores the underwater ice edge and its emperor penguins, Weddell seals and towering icebergs. It’s an exquisite double-act.

4. Penguin: A Story of Survival by Stefan Christmann

More than just a collection of beautiful photographs, Christmann tells one of the most remarkable stories of the animal kingdom – that of the emperor penguin who raises his chicks through the most hostile winter on Earth. Christmann built the body of work for this volume while overwintering at the German research base at Atka Bay. The neighbouring emperor colony, 10,000 strong, was the focus for one of the BBC Natural History Unit Dynasties films, which Christmann helped film. The images of the chicks and the huddle are particularly beautiful, along with his stories of life and survival at the end of the world.

5. Arctic Pearl by Sergey Gorshkov

Wrangel Island is a unique place. Lying 400 miles off the north coast of Russia, this Arctic Island of black beaches and vertiginous cliffs is one of the most unusual, primordial islands on Earth and, in late summer, home to one of the largest populations of polar bears on the planet. Gorshkov is probably the best-known Russian nature photographer, for his award-winning images of Siberian tigers. Over many years, he’s undertaken an ambitious photographic journey across the whole of Russia’s polar region, which he documents through a series of books – this volume being my favourite. It’s an island that is hard to visit, but Gorshkov’s images take us there.

Captivating … a spread from Genesis by Sebastião Salgado. Photograph: Sebastiao Salgado/Taschen

6. Genesis by Sebastião Salgado

While the breadth of this book is more than just polar, Salgado includes imagery from some of the least known and remarkable corners of Antarctica in this study of landscapes untouched by humankind. Few people have heard of the South Sandwich Islands , yet here is “penguin heaven” – one of the largest colonies of chinstrap penguins in the world, who reside on an active volcano, battered on all sides by the terrible force of the Southern Ocean. Salgado’s black and white images are captivating.

7. Antarctic Oasis by Tim and Pauline Carr

Anyone who’s visited South Georgia has probably heard the story of the Carrs who, after 25 years of cruising the world’s oceans, decided to live for five years as the only permanent residents on this wildlife-festooned sub-Antarctic island. This book is a collection of photographs from every season and as they sailed, mountaineered, skied and explored, getting to know its extraordinary colonies of penguins, albatrosses and seals. It’s an insight into their incredible adventure – one most of us could only ever dream of.

8. Arctica: The Vanishing North by Sebastian Copeland

It would be impossible to construct a list like this without including some of the books that dwell on the fragility of our icy landscapes. Copeland has specialised in this across his various books. In this large volume, Copeland immerses us in spectacular scenery from across the Arctic in rich detail, using images that often fold out to spread across three sheets – allowing you to focus on his almost painterly attention to detail. A poignant postcard from the edge.

9. The Last Ocean by John Weller

This beautiful collection of images focuses on Antarctic’s Ross Sea, said to be the last intact marine ecosystem left on the planet. A stunning glimpse of the incredible oceanic landscape – from choppy seas to slabs of floating sea ice – and its charismatic inhabitants, including Adélie penguins, killer whales and Weddell seals.

10. Ice: Portraits of Vanishing Glaciers by James Balog

This book, published in 2012, was the first big photographic project to document the impact of climate change on glaciers. Commissioned by the Extreme Ice Survey, these images are drawn from a body of work taken by a network of glacier-watching cameras positioned from Greenland to the Himalayas. The images invite you to dwell on the ephemeral beauty of these icy landscapes. The cover of the book poignantly says “see it now, because what’s shown in this book will never be seen again in the history of civilisation”. Sadly correct, several of these glaciers are places we revisited in filming Frozen Planet II to find ice conditions quite changed in just a decade.

87,"Budget, borrow and ask the butcher: a first timer’s guide to hosting Christmas","I’m hosting our family’s Christmas for the first time this year. With less than three weeks to the day, I’m making a list, and checking it twice.

What should we cook? How do we put a tree up? Do we continue traditions or seize the opportunity to make our own? And, maybe most importantly, what isn’t even on the radar?

After a couple of years of touch-and-go Christmases, I know I’m not alone in these predicaments. So I’ve enlisted the help of a few experts to guide us through it.

The plan: ‘Sometimes pillow cases go missing’

Darcie Naughton hosted her first Christmas last year in Melbourne after Covid prevented a trip back to her native Western Australia. Eight adults and her two-year-old gathered in her two-bedroom apartment, while she was 30 weeks pregnant. “Getting the house properly clean” ahead of time helped, and she reassuringly adds that hosting was less stressful than “having to travel somewhere for lunch with a baby who sleeps over lunchtime”.

“At home we just popped her down for her normal nap before everyone arrived.”

As the owner of a design and decorating studio, Emma Blomfield is in charge of planning parts of Christmas every year – no matter who is hosting. She proposes making an achievable list of chores that can be chipped away at over the next few weeks, such as hanging art or finally replacing that lightbulb, checking bedding sets (“sometimes pillow cases go missing”) and inspecting serving ware for holes, chips and cracks.

Check you have a full set of cutlery and, if not, try to borrow before you buy. Chairs, tables, crockery and glassware can all be rented and returned too, if you can’t source them for free.

As for the meal, Angela Metri, founder of produce box the Spread Method, recommends first deciding whether you’re actually a planner, or just someone who would “like to be a planner”.

If planning eases (rather than exacerbating) stress, start contacting local producers, such as butchers and fishmongers, now and map out a menu. Blomfield notes this step will also allow you to ensure you have appropriate serving ware.

But if you thrive in last minute-ness, Metri suggests heading to a farmer’s market a few days before 25 December and asking vendors for their recommendations. “It’s the most personalised help you could receive and you don’t need to plan much. The produce is really fresh to boot.”

The decorations: ‘Start from the back then zigzag out’

Alana Arena’s Dancer and Dasher create opulent, ostentatious, OTT trees for celebrities. For her clients, “sparse trees are just not a thing”.

“The tree goes up straight after Halloween” in Arena’s house, but there’s no need to worry if you’ve left it a little later this year.

Don’t own a tree or decorations? See what you can borrow from nearby family and friends before you go shopping. This will save money and storage space come 26 December.

If buying a new tree, Arena suggests choosing a fake one – “real trees should stay in the ground”. If you want it to heave with lights, tinsel and ornaments, find one with “sturdy, thick tendrils” as they’re perfect for decorating.

When setting up the tree, prioritise a spot with power access, in view of the living room or dining table. While Arena says pre-lit trees “save so much time”, if you’re lighting it yourself she suggests going from side-to-side to “hide the cords more easily”.

“I start from the back of the branch then zigzag it to the front,” she says. “I also leave more lights through the interior … so it glows from the centre out.”

Once your tree is lit, start with the largest and most special decorations, giving them prime position, followed by the tree topper, then the rest from largest to smallest.

As for the table setting, if you need to hit up an op shop for more serving ware, Blomfield suggests sticking with a theme. Crockery and cutlery doesn’t need to belong to the same set as long as there is “consistency in terms of colour or shape”.

To decorate, Blomfield searches for flowers, branches and Christmas bush cuttings to create a big bouquet, or stretch along the table “in little bud vases”. Arena adds that extra tree decorations work scattered along the table, or as gifts atop each napkin. Blomfield suggests tying or folding napkins – whether paper or linen – and resting them on a plate with a handwritten name card “on a beautiful piece of paper”.

The guests: little touches go a long way

Whether you have people staying over in a spare room, on a blow-up mattress, or on the couch, Blomfield says small touches make a big difference: nice linen, a side table with a phone charger and a glass of water, maybe even a pair of earplugs and a sleeping mask, or a chocolate on the pillow. Extra special, hotel-like touches – say slippers or a robe – can double as gifts.

And if children are attending, focus on creating a bit of magic. It could involve making a Santa sack together, or leaving cookies out. “My aunt and uncle once went and stamped out little hoof prints in the dirt outside and they found an old antler,” Blomfield says. “We thought that Rudolph had left his antler behind.”

The meal: ‘We all know people who love the soggy chip’

When preparing any special meal, “you have to choose the thing you’re happy to spend: time, money or effort”, Metri says.

If you “don’t mind effort but need to keep costs low, then be prepared to spend time and effort to make a thoughtful plan”, including what you’ll buy, where you’ll buy it and how you’ll allocate your budget. But if you “hate cooking, spend on high-quality ready made foods”.

Think about what your loved ones enjoy eating and choose a showstopper (a splurge to budget everything else around), something to pass around (potatoes, vegetables), something colourful (a salad) and something fun (like a “really good bread to mop up sauces” – she suggests a tearable option like fougasse).

Your showstopper should “trigger a sense of festivity and celebration … Don’t feel pressured to cook a whole turkey if that doesn’t actually feel very celebratory,” Metri says. “Jewelled rice might be festive in one home yet never seen in another.”

If you are going to brave a well-worn family recipe, surrender expectations: “Different ingredients, equipment, timing and cooking experience … guarantee different results,” Metri says.

Naughton chose not to worry about traditions. She bought “fresh veggies and seafood at the markets” and served homemade focaccia, oysters, prawns, ham and “heaps of really great salads”.

Importantly, don’t sweat the small stuff. “Hosting is one of the most beautiful ways to say I love you. Even if your dishes don’t turn out perfectly, trust me, your guests will appreciate the effort,” Metri says.

“We all know people … who love the slightly soggy chip.”

88,How to make nut roast – recipe,"The butt of a thousand tired jokes at the expense of the ‘knit-your-own-lentil brigade’, nut roast may not be quite as fashionable a plant-based centrepiece as a whole cauliflower or a swede steak, but, packed full of luxurious nuts, savoury mushrooms and soft, sweet roast root veg, it’s a cliche well worth reviving.

Prep 25 min

Cook 1 hr 15 min

Serves 6 (with accompaniments)

2 large parsnips

Salt and black pepper

Oil, to grease

1 savoy cabbage, 6-8 outer leaves only

1 red onion

150g chestnut mushrooms

100g peeled and cooked chestnuts

150g hazelnuts

40g butter, or 2½ tbsp oil

40g cranberries

100g brown breadcrumbs

1 small bunch fresh sage, leaves picked

100g stilton (or other vegetarian or vegan-friendly cheese of your choice), optional

½ tsp mixed spice

1 egg, or 2 tbsp Marmite (or similar)

1 Cook and puree the parsnips

Peel the parsnips, cut them into roughly equal chunks, then cook in a large pan of boiling, salted water until tender. Scoop out with a slotted spoon, and put a lid on the pan to keep the water hot for the next step. Drain the parsnips very well, then mash or puree until smooth.

2 Blanch the cabbage

Lightly grease a 21cm x 11cm x 7cm loaf tin with oil, then line it with foil and grease the foil generously, too. Pull off six of the nicest-looking outer leaves from the cabbage, then wash them and trim the bases. Blanch these in the pot of boiling water for two minutes and fill a large bowl or the sink with iced water.

3 Refresh the cabbage

Scoop the cabbage leaves into the iced water, then check you have enough to line the tin, leaving no gaps; if not, blanch and refresh a couple more leaves. Keep the cabbage leaves in the iced water while you make the filling – this will keep them as green as possible, which will make for a more attractive-looking end result.

4 Start on the filling

Peel and finely chop the onion, and finely chop the mushrooms and chestnuts, keeping them all separate for the time being. Heat a dry frying pan on a medium-high heat, then toast the hazelnuts, shaking the pan regularly, until they start to colour; take care not to burn them. Tip the nuts out of the pan and leave to cool.

5 Saute the onion and mushrooms

Turn down the heat to medium, add the butter or oil to the pan, and sweat the onion, stirring from time to time, until soft but not coloured. Add the mushrooms, cook, stirring regularly, until both are soft and the pan is dry, then tip out into a large bowl. Turn off the heat under the pan but don’t wash it up just yet.

6 Finish the filling

Roughly chop the hazelnuts and add these to the mushroom bowl, along with the chopped chestnuts, cranberries and breadcrumbs. Finely chop the sage leaves until you have about about two tablespoons and add that to the bowl as well. If you are using the cheese, crumble that in now, followed by the mashed parsnips and the mixed spice, then stir briefly until everything is evenly distributed.

7 Add the binding agent

Beat the egg, then add that to the filling mix (alternatively, mix the Marmite with 50ml hot water and stir that in instead). Season with salt (if you used Marmite, hold back a little), then check the seasoning by frying a scant teaspoonful of the filling mixture and adjusting as necessary. If you’re cooking the nut roast immediately, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.

8 Build the nut roast

Dry the blanched, refreshed cabbage leaves well, then use them to line the prepared tin, overlapping them to ensure there are no gaps and leaving any excess hanging over the sides. Spoon in the filling mixture, press it down well, then fold any overhanging cabbage leaves over the top. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes. (Alternatively, keep in the fridge for up to 48 hours before cooking.)

9 Finishing touches

Remove the foil from the top, then roast the uncovered loaf for another 15 minutes. Once ready, place a large serving plate over the top of the tin and, holding the tin with oven gloves, turn over so the loaf inverts on to the plate. Carefully peel off the foil, slice and serve.

89,Switzerland’s brilliant new train route: direct from Montreux to Interlaken,"As the train winds up the hillside above Lac Léman’s north shore, leaving Montreux behind, I know exactly where we’re heading because I’ve done this journey before. The bustle of the so-called Swiss Riviera will give way to the tranquil farming country of the Pays d’Enhaut, followed by the upmarket resort of Gstaad, before a gentle descent to Interlaken, between the twin lakes of Thun and Brienz in the Bernese Oberland. This 70-mile route, which crosses the röstigraben (the French-Swiss German language border) and links some of Switzerland’s most famous tourist centres, has existed for more than 100 years. But there’s one big difference today: thanks to a world first in rail technology, I don’t have to change trains halfway through.

The GoldenPass line, as it’s called, opened in stages between 1901 and 1916, the realisation of a decades-old dream to connect Lake Geneva, Gstaad and the Bernese Oberland by rail. But the journey wasn’t seamless. Because of the mountainous terrain, the railway from Montreux to Zweisimmen required metric gauge rails (one-metre wide), while the stretch from Zweisimmen to Interlaken was built with standard gauge (1.435 metres wide). Given no train could travel on both, passengers had to change at Zweisimmen.

Not much of an inconvenience, you might think. Nevertheless, the Swiss relish an engineering challenge, and this was one the Montreux Oberland Bernois railway (MOB) and BLS (the two train companies operating the line) were determined to solve. After decades wrestling with this technological conundrum, in 2008 MOB proposed a solution: a bespoke bogie (the part of a train’s undercarriage that supports the wheels) which can narrow or widen to fit the different widths of the two railways, as well as adjust to their different platform heights.

Developed in Switzerland by Alstom, the resultant technology is unique. Though variable-gauge bogies exist elsewhere, no other can adapt quite as much as this one, making it a world first for Switzerland – a country that just loves a railway-related record. The alpine nation already has the world’s longest and deepest train tunnel (the Gotthard Base Tunnel), the world’s steepest funicular (the Stoosbahn in Schwyz) and Europe’s highest railway station (the Jungfraujoch at 3,454 metres). The world’s most variable bogie may not have quite the same ring, but it’s still a remarkable achievement in train technology.

From 11 December the brand new GoldenPass Express trains, fitted with these bogies, offer passengers a non-stop 3hr 15min journey with no need to cart luggage from platform to platform halfway through. However, that’s not the only reason MOB invested £77m in the project. It also wanted to bring glamour to the line. The new carriages have large two-part windows and table seating in all three classes – second, first and “prestige”. The latter is a step up, literally: the carriage sits 40cm higher than the rest, supposedly immersing passengers more fully in the landscape (though I find the scenery just as glorious from second class), while its heated, reclinable seats can swivel to face the direction of travel. The on-board menu of local products also has added wow factor in first and prestige, including Swiss-made caviar from the Tropenhaus in Frutigen, a fish farm that harnesses thermal water from the mountains.

Lovely though all this is, nothing beats the view. This ultra-modern ride takes us past rural rail stations, traditional wooden chalets and farm buildings, forests daubed with fresh snow, and the 15th-century church of Château d’Oex, whose position on the La Motte rock makes it a photogenic focal point during the hot air balloon festival that takes place here every January. Though the idea of the GoldenPass Express is that you don’t get off, there’s plenty of temptation en route.

We’ve swapped French for Swiss German, the palm trees and vineyards of Montreux for views of the Eiger and Jungfrau

The technological magic happens about two hours in, when we reach Zweisimmen station. As the carriages pass over a special ramp installed on the track, flaps support their weight so the bogies can adjust with the pressure off. It happens in seconds, and so smoothly that it’s unnoticeable, which is entirely the point. Most of the eight-minute stoppage time is taken up by switching the locomotive that drives the train, since the two railways also run on a different electrical voltage.

Then we’re off again, onwards and gently downwards until we emerge from the hills and skirt Lake Thun on the way to Interlaken, where our journey ends. We’ve swapped French for Swiss German, the palm trees and vineyards of Montreux for views of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau (Grindelwald, with its new Eiger Express cable car and onwards connection to the Jungfraujoch, is just half an hour away) and it’s finally time to disembark. However, the GoldenPass line doesn’t actually finish here. From Interlaken, passengers can continue to Lucerne, though with a change of train since part of that stretch of the railway is cogwheel. Might the new trains be adapted accordingly? It’s another technical challenge for the Swiss to solve – and I have no doubt that one day, they will.

90,A moment that changed me: my grandmother was moved into a home – and her history erased,"My grandmother was a keeper of unofficial histories at a time when “the facts” of history were largely undisputed, and guarded by men like my grandfather. He was the editor of the local newspaper, when women’s stories were still often considered the province of gossip and old wives’ tales. And so, even within the family, his stories took precedence.

My grandfather died before I was born. But when I started to hear them, the stories behind the many medals and awards he had won for his newswriting simply didn’t capture my imagination, or a sense of possibility, in the way my grandmother’s stories did.

She told me about growing up performing with her sister on vaudeville stages; her despair, at the age of nine, when her mother refused her the opportunity to travel to Russia to study piano with one of the grandmasters. She brought to life not merely the hopes and dreams of an extremely talented young musician forced from an early age to be a “little earner” for her very poor family, but the hopes and dreams of working-class Peterborough, Ontario, at the beginning of the 20th century.

With a sense of cheekiness and wonder, she regaled us with the history of the infamous Black Donnellys – a marauding family whose mass slaughter by a vigilante mob in 1880s Ontario prompted her mother to illegally change the spelling of their last name, such was the scandal – that even today is part of Canadian folklore.

Perhaps it was the way she always believed the best of people, but, through her eyes, and in her tellings, the survivors of the Great War and the Spanish flu pandemic came alive, in all their spirit and tenacity. As her only grandchild, and one who relished spending time with her, I was frequently treated to “trips down memory lane” – to unofficial histories of our city, its people and our family. I loved them all, and enthusiastically encouraged her to tell me more. I didn’t bother my grandmother with the tumultuousness of my own home life, but I sensed she knew, not just because I was so often dropped on her doorstep, but in the way her stories soothed and grounded me – a young girl who desperately needed to belong, to feel rooted.

She had worked so hard to curate a legacy for herself, to form a bridge between family past and family future

As she entered her mid-80s (she would live to be 98), she feared that her memory was not as whip-sharp as it had always been, and she began writing her stories on white index cards which she attached to her treasured possessions. She had kept a few of the unique string instruments her father had made, for example, and she wrote about cold winter nights when her Irish family would entertain themselves with songs from the old country. It provided some succour for hungry tummies.

After about a year, white index cards, or smaller scraps of paper, peeked out from behind every photo, painting, figurine, and just about every book in her carefully curated library. She may have written these notes for herself, but she also told me they were for those she would leave behind. She knew that everything existed in a context, and she was determined to lay claim to her own story – of how the material things that surrounded her helped to soothe, nourish and define her sense of family legacy, identity and place in the world. And, unbeknown to us, she had another purpose – her sight was failing. She was a proud woman, but she also feared that her children would pack her off to an assisted living facility if they learned of her disability.

And sure enough, they did. My grandmother walked into her coffee table on a Monday morning, injuring her knee, and was rehomed by Tuesday afternoon. By Wednesday morning, a large skip had been rented to clear out her house, and an auctioneer had been fetched for an appraisal of the contents.

I was studying for my master’s degree in Toronto, and decided to come home on the Friday. By the time I walked into her house, it was stripped of its objects and household items. All that remained were the legions of white index cards and pieces of paper, which covered the ground like a blanket of snow.

Bereft of their context, most of the notes made a lot less sense, but I kept many of them anyway. And I discovered that she was particularly evocative about the way literature touched her. “This collection of poetry sustains me in a way that human relationships sometimes don’t. It’s also less demanding. I remember my mother reading it to us as children. Perhaps that’s why I am so soothed by it. P.144 especially. I go back to it regularly.”

All that remained were the legions of white cards, which covered the ground like a blanket of snow

Many of the notes recalled her childhood, or her thoughts and feelings about what was happening in her life when a particular object was given to her, bought or made. She had worked so hard to curate a legacy for herself, to form a bridge between family past and family future. The abrupt rehoming had been bad enough – I couldn’t bear to tell her that her histories had been prised from their objects, because how could her belongings fetch money with her memories still attached to them? It was unspoken between us that she was fully aware of what had happened. While I will always regret not helping my grandmother to acknowledge that loss head-on, I will always be grateful that she didn’t see her emptied home.

Soon after, she and I had gone on a secret mission to try to buy back some of her lost treasures. We had some success. We found her aunt’s tea service and a quilt her mother had made, and reclaimed them. Other things we found, such as her Limoges dinner set, some earrings her husband had given her as an anniversary present, and a first edition of Great Expectations, were too expensive for the budgets of a pensioner and a student.

In the end, they say my grandmother died of old age. And although I know that this is largely true, I can’t help feeling that being ripped from the pages of history – a history she had attempted to write – also played its part. After the move, she slowly shut down and became depressed, emotionally unavailable and uninterested in talking about her past or the things that used to bring her joy. She had often told me that history is taught from the perspective of the winner. Yet most of her stories – which brought working-class people and women to the forefront – challenged this. To see her legacy in tatters at my feet was not only a moment when learning collided with deeply depressing understanding, it was a reminder of how vulnerable elderly people are when it comes to relying on successive generations to treasure what they have to pass down. It transformed the way I think about history – what “counts”, who gets to tell it, and how very many are silenced in the process. Walking into her empty home that day was a moment that changed me, because, surrounded by the blizzard of her unofficial histories, I decided to make a subversive historical change myself: I dropped my last name, and adopted her maiden name as my own. I even made it official.",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/07/a-moment-that-changed-me-my-grandmother-was-moved-into-a-home-and-her-history-erased,2022-12-07T00:00:00
91,"‘No lack of wildness’ - a car-free break on the John Muir Way, Scotland","Pioneering conservationist John Muir was born in Dunbar on the east coast of Scotland in 1838, and his birthplace is now a museum. He moved to the US when he was 11 and went on to create the Sierra Club organisation, which still protects Yosemite and other national parks. “When I was a boy in Scotland, I was fond of all things wild …” he wrote. “Around my native town of Dunbar by the stormy North Sea, there was no lack of wildness, though most of the land lay in smooth cultivation.”

In the John Muir country park near Dunbar, 30 miles east of Edinburgh, there’s a smell of stranded seaweed and crushed pine needles, the insistent peeping of oystercatchers and the rising whistles of mud-probing curlews. A bracken-bordered path, with straggles of harebells and honeysuckle, runs beside the wide Tyne estuary (Scotland also has a River Tyne), through saltmarsh dotted with samphire and sea asters, and past smooth sandy beaches where wagtails hop over the rocks. It leads on along red cliffs towards what Muir called the “craggy ruins of the old Dunbar castle”.

This is the eastern end of the coast-to-coast John Muir Way, a long-distance path launched in 2014, 100 years after Muir died. Its 134-mile course stretches from Helensburgh in the west to Dunbar, and walking some or all of it makes for a great holiday. It’s affordable and sustainable, thanks to great public transport links that make it easy to head back to a cheap base each night. In summer 2021, the John Muir Way also launched a series of day walks and cycle rides.

The need to protect the natural world in the face of climate crisis and ecological catastrophe, grows more urgent every year. Though many of us have never heard of him, Muir influenced today’s green movement and his ideas have never been more vital.

I was walking beside the Firth of Forth when I first saw a signpost for the John Muir Way; a few years later, I’m back in the pretty town of Linlithgow, about halfway along the route, for the start of a week’s gentle, eastward pilgrimage rich in wildlife and history.

Though many of us have never heard of him, Muir influenced today’s green movement

Stained glass casts rainbow-coloured patterns across the stone floor and pillars of Saint Michael’s church in Linlithgow. Over the road, in the town museum (free), there’s a typewriter that belonged to former local MP Tam Dalyell and musket balls that were found near lochside Linlithgow Palace, birthplace of Mary, Queen of Scots. The John Muir Way leads north from the far end of town to the shore of the Firth of Forth, past remnants of the Roman Antonine Wall, a slightly younger, turf-built version of Hadrian’s more famous frontier.

With the glinting water on my left, I eventually shake off the industrial fringes of Bo’ness and walk a total of 10 miles, past silver birches and sea tangle tide marks, to towering Blackness Castle. Bus 49 runs four times each weekday back to Linlithgow, where I’m staying the night. Edinburgh is less than 20 minutes away by train.Through waterside woods next morning, I reach the Hopetoun estate (reopens 7 April 2023), where sheep and deer graze under the oaks. It’s almost a shock to climb the lane and catch sight of a flashing tower on the 2017 Queensferry Crossing, newest of the Forth Bridges. I detour up the long drive of Hopetoun House to eat courgette-and-ginger cake in an old stables, and wander past tapestries, portraits and a magnificent domed central stairway.

The John Muir Way heads on through Queensferry, past the bridges, and finds green routes through Edinburgh: along the wooded Water of Leith, the Union Canal, and the spire-ringed Meadows to emerge in Southside, where a queue is forming outside Bits Bake Shop. I’ve stayed two nights in Edinburgh, covering about 10 miles a day, which leaves time to explore. I buy coffee and a cardamom-pistachio roll to eat at the foot of Salisbury Crags, which are already looming at the end of the road. Climbing is optional on the JMW – you can easily detour up the crags and Arthur’s Seat. The official route, however, follows the former, horse-drawn Innocent Railway, a cycle path that skirts Edinburgh’s volcanic hills past Scotland’s first railway tunnel.

Duddingston Loch, which I’ve only ever seen from the top of Arthur’s Seat, stays stubbornly out of sight behind a high wall. A sign says “Craigmillar Castle ½ mile”, but I press on along a streamside path to reach Newhailes, another Palladian mansion, where I’m booked on an afternoon tour. The short detour to Newhailes passes a ruined summerhouse, cascades and a grotto, once part of the elegant, 18th-century water gardens, built to impress guests. The old curling pool (which used to freeze over in winter) has dried up, and the crumbling main house is a Havishamesque pile, full of golden shell motifs, flowery wreaths of baroque stucco work, distant sea views and rich melancholy.

I watch gannets plummet beak-first into the sun-burnished waves and herons standing guard over the harbour

I’m staying the last three nights in Dunbar’s Dolphin Inn (doubles from £55). Dunbar is easy to access by train from Musselburgh near Newhailes and North Berwick, where I end next day, beyond the wooded grounds of Gosford House and the long sands of Aberlady Bay. (Regular buses allow you to skip one or two roadside miles and leave more time to wander on the beach.) The Dolphin is a fresh, friendly hostel, spotlessly clean, with vintage touches, cheerful murals and a help-yourself continental breakfast. At Hector’s artisan pizzeria, just down the road, the toppings include smoky Sgaia vegan charcuterie from Glasgow and strong, creamy cheeses from Doddington dairy, over the border in Northumberland.

On my last morning I catch bus 120 past Tantallon Castle to North Berwick and start at the Scottish Seabird Centre. Scotland has over 10,000 miles of coastline, more than 60% of the UK’s total, and 45% of all Europe’s breeding seabirds live or visit here, including puffins, guillemots, kittiwakes and cormorants. Despite being hit by avian flu this year, Bass Rock still hosts the world’s largest colony of northern gannets, and the Latin and French words for gannet both derive from the name of this rocky island off the East Lothian coast.

Several hours later, having followed the John Muir Way past a red-roofed watermill near the village of East Linton, and the strange Bridge to Nowhere in Belhaven Bay, I’m finally strolling the clifftop path back towards Dunbar. I watch huge white gannets plummet beak-first into the sun-burnished waves and herons standing guard over the harbour. Edinburgh is half an hour away by train and I’m heading home to Essex via the night train to London. So there’s plenty of time to pop into the Volunteer Arms for a last pint of Belhaven best, a malty beer from Scotland’s oldest working brewery, down the road.

On new Caledonian Sleeper trains launched in 2019, you can leave London late at night and be in Edinburgh for breakfast. Travelling overnight means you can avoid flying, but don’t have to give up daytime hours to travel.

I fall asleep as the rocking train hurtles southwards. John Muir left Dunbar by train in 1849, heading for the US, when the railways were new. By the time he revisited Scotland, nearly half a century later, the east coast line had opened the area to visitors. But he wrote in a letter that the evening waves, breaking on the rocky shore where Muir had played as a boy, still sang “the same old songs they sang to me in my childhood”.

92,"My new partner and I haven’t had sex for two weeks. Last time I tried, they were too tired. Should we split up?","I’m a gay man in my mid-20s. I’ve been seeing someone for almost two months and we’ve slept together a handful of times. Despite hanging out for the past two weeks, though, we haven’t had sex. The other night I tried to initiate and was rejected; they said they were tired. I brought up my frustration and queried whether they actually fancied me. They were shocked that I’d question whether they fancied me and brushed it off. I left that night and received a grovelling apology by text, but that just made me feel worse. I felt as if I was guilting someone into having sex with me, which isn’t exactly sexy. But I also recognise that my wants in the bedroom aren’t being met. I’m not sure if it’s worth carrying on with this relationship, but I really like the person. Are we incompatible?

You don’t yet know each other well at all, so it’s far too early to know about compatibility. Is it not possible that they actually were tired the other night? Fatigue, stress and overwork can greatly affect a person’s sexual desire and arousal. Let’s say you were oversensitive and took it as a rejection – ask yourself if this is a familiar pattern for you. If we are open to it, we can learn more about ourselves with each relationship, each experience, and this process of self-discovery is thankfully lifelong. Perhaps the lesson here is that you are expecting a lot for such a new liaison. Consider what it is you really want and need at this point in your life. If you are simply in the market for great, uncomplicated and brief sexual encounters with people who are always ready, understand that you are bound to be disappointed some percentage of the time. And you may also miss out on the pleasures of true intimacy in a deeper relationship. But you say that you “really like the person”. Let that be your guide. Try to get to know each other better generally. Sex can wax and wane, but likability can be a vital marker for relationship longevity.

93,‘The metaverse will be our slow death!’ Is Facebook losing its $100bn gamble on virtual reality?,"What a difference a year makes. Last October, Facebook supremo Mark Zuckerberg could barely wait to show the world what he was up to. “Today, we’re going to talk about the metaverse,” he enthused in a slick video presentation. “I want to share what we imagine is possible.” Transitioning almost seamlessly from his real self into a computer-generated avatar, Zuckerberg guided us through his vision for the virtual-reality future: playing poker in space with your buddies; sharing cool stuff; having work meetings and birthday parties with people on the other side of the world; customising your avatar (the avatars had no legs, which was weird). Zuckerberg was so all-in on the metaverse, he even rechristened his company Meta.

This month, we saw a more subdued Zuckerberg on display: “I wanna say upfront that I take full responsibility for this decision,” he told employees morosely. “This was ultimately my call and it was one of the hardest calls that I’ve had to make in the 18 years of running the company.” Meta was laying off 11,000 people – 13% of its workforce. Poor third-quarter results had seen Meta’s share price drop by 25%, wiping $80bn off the company’s value. Reality Labs, Meta’s metaverse division, had lost $3.7bn in the past three months, with worse expected to come. It wasn’t all bad news, though: Zuckerberg announced last month that Meta avatars would at last be getting legs.

After decades of spectacular “move fast and break things” growth, Zuckerberg’s empire is now looking a little fragile. Meta’s share price has fallen by more than 70% this year. Moneyspinners Facebook and Instagram are losing market share and Gen Z users to fresher rivals like TikTok and Snapchat. Apple’s changes to data privacy last year also decimated revenues – its introduction of an “ask not to track” option on iPhones has effectively starved Facebook of the lucrative data it uses to target ads.

Meanwhile, Meta has invested a staggering $100bn on metaverse research and development to date, $15bn in the past year alone – with apparently little to show for it. Zuckerberg’s newfound metaverse obsession could be seen as a preemptive virtual land grab for what is generally agreed to be the future of the internet.

It could also represent an attempted second act, for both the 38-year-old and his somewhat tarnished Facebook brand. But the markets seem to be saying “count us out”, and according to reports, just 58% of Meta’s own employees said they understood the company’s metaverse vision. Comments on the latest lay-offs in an anonymous employee survey included, “the metaverse will be our slow death” and “Mark Zuckerberg will single-handedly kill a company with the metaverse”.

If nothing else, Zuckerberg has popularised the term “metaverse”, even if he didn’t invent it, and definitions of what it means vary. Zuckerberg explained it as “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it”. Rather than our current 2D, screen-based internet, in other words, the metaverse will be a 3D virtual space, accessed by either a VR headset or AR (augmented reality) glasses, which superimpose a layer of digital information on top of the visible world.

Matthew Ball, tech investor and author of The Metaverse: How It Will Revolutionise Everything, defines the metaverse as “a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds”, with individual presence and continuity of data. He has to explain it less and less, he says: “A year ago, it was mostly ‘what is the metaverse?’ Questions now are a lot more practical: what will be here? When? For whom? How, and why?”

The “why” is a particularly good question when it comes to Meta. “You’re going to be able to do almost anything you can imagine,” said Zuckerberg in his intro video last year. “Get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create …”

At the time we were just coming out of the pandemic. Remote working, video calling and e-commerce had suddenly become the norm. “Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended,” Zuckerberg said in a recent staff email. “I did, too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.” Post-pandemic, it turned out people still preferred meeting face to face or on a video call to donning a clunky VR headset and dragging your legless avatar into a virtual meeting room.

It has been a similar story on the leisure side. Meta’s Quest VR headsets are the market leader, but most buyers are not using them to flock to Meta’s principal app, Horizon Worlds – which the company describes as “a synchronous social network where creators can build engaging worlds”. Meta set a target of 500,000 Horizon Worlds users by the end of 2022; the current figure is nearer 200,000 – down from 300,000 in February, which suggests many first-time visitors are not returning. It has been criticised for programming bugs, instability, rudimentary graphics and a general sense of boredom.

From my own visits to Horizon Worlds, the 3D motion and audio were fine but the graphics were basic, often garish and textureless: a good two decades behind today’s best video games. The feeling is of a sparsely attended trade fair.

‘A good two decades behind today’s best video games’ … Steve Rose’s avatar on Meta’s Horizon Worlds.

Many of Horizon Worlds’ activities felt more like demonstrations: in a perfunctory wild west town, you can shoot a virtual bottle in a virtual saloon with your virtual pistol (with unsatisfyingly lo-fi results) and ride a hobby horse (literally a virtual horse’s head on a broomstick). At the Marvel superheroes world, you can try on various costumes that enable you to fly or shoot lightning bolts, and that’s about it. There were few people in either the social “hangout” areas or the “games” section, and most of the strangers I encountered seemed to be American children. One had the avatar and voice of a 10-year-old girl.

Not even the people making Horizon Worlds have embraced it. Memos leaked in October appeared to show the Meta vice-president, Vishal Shah, urging staff to use their own products more. “If we don’t love it, how can we expect our users to love it?” Shah wrote. “Everyone in this organisation should make it their mission to fall in love with Horizon Worlds. You can’t do that without using it. Get in there.”

Meanwhile, direct competitors such as VRChat and Rec Room are thriving. “It’s pretty clear they are offering something that Meta doesn’t,” says veteran games designer Raph Koster, namely better avatars, a wider choices of games and, critically, bigger crowds (Rec Room has an estimated three million monthly users). “Next to those, Meta looks relatively sterile and empty. There’s just a lack of sufficient entertainment in there.”

‘Thriving’ … Meta rival VRChat.

Horizon World’s numbers are dwarfed by those of online games (most of which are accessible with and without VR headsets). Fortnite attracts 250 million active players a month. Gaming platform Roblox has more 200 million visitors a month and Minecraft 170 million (two-thirds of whom are under 16 – the exact demographic that is turning away from Facebook and other social media).

“Historically, we’ve seen that game worlds generally don’t have any trouble attracting an audience,” says Koster. This is not a revelation. “Bars with a jukebox or a pool table tend to do better than bars without anything. It doesn’t change because you digitise the experience.”

Unlike Meta, the games industry began with the “why?” It was building complex, sophisticated, popular virtual worlds – proto-metaverses – long before the idea caught Zuckerberg’s eye. As such, it is well positioned for a slice of the metaverse pie. Epic Games, for example, whose Unreal game engine (think of it as the “brain” of the game; the software framework that builds the reality in real time) powers not only its bestselling Fortnite but hundreds of other games and applications, making it attractive to independent metaverse-builders.

In April, Sony and Lego invested $2bn in Epic’s metaverse vision. In January, Microsoft moved to acquire another games giant, Activision Blizzard, makers of World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Call of Duty and Candy Crush, for nearly $70bn (the deal is currently under antitrust review).

Having sprung out of social networks like Facebook, Meta’s model is based on “an attention economy, not a fulfilment economy”, says Herman Narula, head of the British tech company Improbable. Social media prioritises keeping users passively engaged for as long as possible, whereas gaming seeks to provide fulfilling, active experiences.

“There’s a difference between watching an experience and having an experience,” he says. “If you look at games like Fortnite and Minecraft … what matters is presence; how many things can you do? In Minecraft, you can move anything about it, you can modify the laws, you can be creative. So what matters is creating a highly creative environment, which allows the normal self-expression.”

Improbable’s website claims “we are the metaverse technology company”. Among other things (it works with military as well as gaming companies), the company, which Narula co-founded in 2012, is working on connecting various metaverses together, and hosting large numbers of people in virtual worlds. Whereas most multiplayer online games, like Fortnite, never really put more than 100 people together on one server, Improbable has hosted events bringing together 30,000 people in the same virtual space.

Unsurprisingly, Narula is optimistic about the metaverse. In his recent book Virtual Society, he writes: “Like the development of writing, or the advent of the computer age, the dawn of the metaverse will be a grand pivot point in the history of humanity.”

The metaverse was valued at nearly $23bn last year and is expected to grow nearly 40% a year for the rest of the decade. As the Epic co-founder and CEO Tim Sweeney put it last year: “The next three years are going to be critical for all of the metaverse-aspiring companies like Epic, Roblox, Microsoft, Facebook [Meta]. It’s kind of a race to get to a billion users. Whoever brings on a billion users first would be the presumed leader in setting the standards.”

The building blocks of the metaverse are coming together, and Meta is working on many of them: hardware like VR and AR devices, data and network infrastructure, social platforms and interfaces, developer and creator ecosystems – all of which require skilled people (in Meta’s recent 11,000-person cull, Reality Labs was relatively unscathed).

“We are creating a new category that requires significantly and abundantly more resources than it takes to create a single product or collection of products,” says a Meta spokesperson. “It’s misguided to categorise our long-term investment as a loss while we are within our initial phases of development.” So no more “move fast and break things”; now it’s more of a “move slowly and build things” vibe.

From the outset, Zuckerberg said the metaverse would take five to 10 years to arrive, though some, such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, are saying it is here already. Matthew Ball agrees: “We have hundreds of millions interacting in 3D virtual worlds each day,” he says, pointing to the likes of Roblox and Minecraft.

But it goes beyond gaming: “Johns Hopkins University hospital is now performing surgery with XR [as in “extended reality” – VR and AR] devices and game engines, while Vancouver airport runs a 3D simulation [a “digital twin” of the airport, incorporating real-time information which can be used for training, optimisation, future planning, simulation and testing] and similarly Tesla cars are building a live simulation of San Francisco using Unreal. The pieces are more mature than many give credit, but we’ve yet to develop the standards and systems to integrate them in the ways the internet is developed today.”

It is unlikely that Meta, or any other big tech company, will “own” the metaverse, says Ball. “We often misrepresent the control of big tech,” he says, pointing out that the “Big Five” – Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft – together collect less than 10% of digital revenues, “although they exert disproportionate influence over the rest of the internet … It is likely that a similar outcome happens with the metaverse: a handful of vertically and horizontally integrated software and hardware giants amass the substantial share of users, data, revenue, devices, etc, and exert even greater influence. The metaverse is likely to grow big tech’s reach, not shrink it.”

If Meta does succeed in controlling a substantial slice of the metaverse, though, there are further, deeper concerns. The charge sheet against social media in general, and Facebook/Meta in particular, is extensive: disseminating and amplifying online disinformation and hate speech, unseen and undisclosed political influence, its impact on mental health, the collection and misuse of personal data.

“Whatever company owns the metaverse will have better information about crime, better surveillance, better everything than the government will,” says Koster. He points out how much of our lives is already online: our personal records, our résumés, our bank accounts, our friendships, our online movements and behaviours. The metaverse will enable access to even more layers of data: “A lot of the folks who work on the hardware for AR glasses, for example, are concerned about the fact that the glasses can read biometrics off your iris, and that tells them an enormous amount about your medical state, your emotions moment to moment. Virtual worlds are panopticons. The more we digitise the world, that’s the power we’re handing over to whoever runs that metaverse.”

Meta is taking pains to assuage such fears. “The metaverse is a collective project,” says a spokesperson, “and how to responsibly manage the new types of data that companies may collect is exactly the kind of challenge that needs collaboration and discussion. It’s not up to any one company to set the rules on this.”

All are in agreement that regulation is needed, but judging by how well the internet has been governed so far, the outlook is complicated – potentially liberating; potentially downright dystopian.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/07/metaverse-slow-death-facebook-losing-100bn-gamble-virtual-reality-mark-zuckerberg,2022-12-07T00:00:00
94,"Indonesia’s sex ‘morality’ laws are just one part of a broader, chilling crackdown on dissent","Indonesia’s new criminal code limits the right to protest and participate in the public sphere, threatens the freedom of women and LGBTQ people and represents a trend of vague or “rubber” laws that are open to broad interpretation and selective implementation, experts have warned.

With provisions restoring a ban on insulting the president, state institutions and state ideology, as well as extramarital and premarital sex, the code will come into effect within three years, following Indonesia’s 2024 elections. Insults to a sitting president can lead to up to three years in jail.

The code was passed with support from all political parties in Indonesia’s parliament. Legislators hailed the vote as a decades-long effort to replace Dutch colonial laws that remained a deep part of the country’s judicial system.

While the so-called “morality” laws governing sex outside marriage have worrying implications, academics and experts were most concerned by the provisions governing insults to the president, state institutions and national ideology.

“What is being obscured by the discussion of the moralistic aspects is the fact that there is legislation that now that limits significantly the room for protests and criticism,” said Vedi Hadiz, professor of Asian studies and the director of the University of Melbourne’s Asia Institute.

“We’ve seen that development take place over several years now, but this is the clearest signal that there is a consensus that this is the way that Indonesian democracy is going to develop beyond the next elections.”

Ken Setiawan, a senior lecturer in Indonesian Studies at the University of Melbourne, said: “The provisions are generally broadly and vaguely formulated. And that really is a concern, because then it’s open to broad interpretation. It can be applied to anyone.”

“This is a trend in Indonesian lawmaking. In Indonesian we call it pasal karet, which means ‘rubber clauses’.” Setiawan pointed out that the vagueness of the laws means that they can be selectively applied to particular individuals or groups.

“When something is grey, or slippery, or nebulous,” said Eve Warburton, the director of Australia National University’s Indonesia Institute, it makes it difficult to know how an individual’s behaviour will be interpreted or where the boundaries are. “And I think that is precisely the point.”

“Laws that criminalise political dissent or criminalise critiquing heads of state or government don’t have to be used in a systematic way, they can be used in a very ad-hoc, unpredictable way,” Warburton said.

“The effect is the same: it intimidates opponents, it chills dissent, because it increases the risk of being thrown in prison for your political opinions.”

Hadiz, too, believed the laws would be selectively implemented. “I don’t think that you’ll see mass crackdowns on civil society organisations, on the press and so on, but having the fear hover over your head that you can be penalised for what you say, what you do, certainly will constrain the behaviour of a lot of people.”

Benjamin Hegarty an anthropologist at Deakin University who studies gender and sexuality in Indonesia, said: “The laws consolidate several provisions at the regional level and these can be selectively applied to groups, including LGBT groups, in ways that can reduce scope for participation in the public sphere.”

‘Regulating the private sexual lives of its citizens’

Looking at how regional provisions had been applied could provide an insight into what Indonesia may look like in three years’ time when the laws come into effect.

“From what we’ve seen in regional regulations, and I think they’re a good test case of what’s to come, is that there haven’t been sweeping arrests or a focus on any specific group, but you’ve seen a narrowing of public space and the ability to participate in it.”

The new laws mean that sex outside marriage will be punishable by a year in jail and cohabitation by six months. Charges can be based only on police reports lodged by a spouse, parents or children.

Women will be more vulnerable than men to accusations of behaviour that is immoral, said Hadiz, and it was a setback to people of minority sexual orientation, “because according to the law they can’t be married”, and therefore cannot have sex at all.

“If you’re the person whose partner has cheated on them, or whose child is gay, then it in a sense opens the door for you to report them to authorities,” said Hegarty.

“Any law that sets out to regulate morality, and regulate the private sexual lives of its citizens, it inevitably ends up being mostly about women and women’s sexuality, especially in very religious societies,” said Warburton, who added that women’s rights organisations in Indonesia were fearful that the laws could be used to intimidate and scare women wanting to report sexual harassment and assault.

Setiawan pointed out that among the provisions in the code is one prohibiting the promotion of contraception, which raises the risk of unintended pregnancies.

“Unintended pregnancies can affect a range of rights, including by ending a girl’s education and contributing to child marriage, as well as putting women and girls’ lives at risk and other health complications,” according to Human Rights Watch.

“It’s interesting that they put this together with morality laws, as if to say, ‘We are building an Indonesia that is moral and pious and virtuous’,” said Hadiz, “So from that point of view, ‘We also have the kind of morality and virtue that you really shouldn’t doubt that we are above corruption and abuse of power’.”

It was a “very cynical” way to package the laws, he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/indonesias-sex-morality-laws-are-just-one-part-of-a-broader-chilling-crackdown-on-dissent,2022-12-07T00:00:00
95,Share your views on Indonesia’s new laws criminalising sex outside marriage,"Indonesia, the world’s third-largest democracy, has approved legislation that outlaws sex outside marriage as one of several sweeping changes to the country’s criminal code.

The new code, which will apply to Indonesians and visiting foreigners alike and has prompted alarm from human rights campaigners, will also prohibit cohabitation between unmarried couples.

The new legislation will not apply immediately, but the old code will transition to the new one within three years.

We’d like to hear from Indonesians and people planning to visit the country what their views are on the new legislation.

96,Discovered in the deep: the extraordinary sawshark with a weapon-like snout,"Swimming through the ocean are sharks that look as if they have a hedge trimmer fixed to their heads and a dangling moustache part way along it. These are sawsharks and they use their formidable headgear to slash through shoals of fish. The moustache is a sensory device that helps the sharks detect prey.

“Sawsharks are something extraordinary,” says Simon Weigmann from the Elasmobranch Research Laboratory in Hamburg, Germany.

Until recently, scientists knew of eight species of sawshark, including one that has six gill slits in the side of its body. “This is unusual among sharks,” says Weigmann – as most sharks have five gill slits. With the help of fishers in Madagascar and Tanzania, two more species of sixgill sawsharks have come to light.

Q&A What is the Discovered in the deep series? Show The ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths. As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, a new Guardian Seascape series will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth – and how much there is to protect.

Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

Long before western scientists named them, people in fishing communities in south-west Madagascar already knew about metre-long, sixgill sawsharks and called them vae vae. In 2017, a Malagasy fisher gave two of the saw-like snouts (called rostra) to Ruth Leeney, a biologist visiting from London’s Natural History Museum. Realising they were something different, she sent them to Weigmann. He tracked down more preserved specimens that had been sitting on shelves in museums, and realised they belonged to a distinct species of sixgill sawshark.

“Formerly, we thought that we just had one species occurring off South Africa, Mozambique and Madagascar. Now we know Madagascar has a different species,” says Weigmann.

It’s important just to give the species a name, to bring attention to it Simon Weigmann

The name he picked for the scientific literature is Pliotrema kajae – Kaja’s sixgill sawshark – after his young daughter who watched on with great interest while he examined the preserved shark specimens at home. Kaja also means warrior in Frisian, a west-Germanic language, which Weigmann thought was appropriate given sharks’ weapon-like snouts.



A specimen of a third species of sixgill sawshark came to Weigmann after colleagues visited a fish market on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar. He named this one P annae, after Kaya’s cousin Anna.



Something that sets these species apart from previously known sawsharks is that their moustaches (technically known as barbels) lie closer to the tip of their snouts, but Weigmann doesn’t yet know the relevance of this.

Similarly, there’s no obvious explanation for why these sawsharks have six gill slits. Out of the more than 1,000 species of sharks and rays, only a handful have six or seven gill slits.

The three species of sixgill sawsharks live in different parts of the Indian Ocean. The original species, P warreni, lives off South Africa and southern Mozambique, down to about 900 metres. Kajas have been found between 200 and 300 metres underwater off Madagascar and on the submarine Mascarene plateau that stretches between Seychelles and Mauritius. Annas have so far only been found off Zanzibar, in much shallower waters of between 20 and 35 metres.



“It’s important to give the species a name, to bring attention to it,” says Weigmann. The next steps will be to work out just how threatened the species is and whether it needs protecting.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/07/discovered-in-the-deep-the-extraordinary-sawshark-with-a-weapon-like-snout,2022-12-07T00:00:00
97,‘These are not crimes’: women in Argentina facing jail for obstetric emergencies,"One morning in December 2020, La China* was overcome with abdominal cramps. She has polycystic ovary syndrome and has often suffered severe pain and irregular, heavy periods. The condition was a reason why she hadn’t realised she was pregnant until after eight months with her first child, and until after six months with the second.

That morning, in intense pain, the 43-year-old Venezuelan, who lives in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, took some painkillers and went to bed. But she began bleeding profusely. What happened next is disputed.

La China says she gathered up what she thought were large clots of blood on her bedsheets into a bag, which she threw into a bin near her house.

The police, who arrested her a few days later, say she gave birth to a baby at 39 weeks’ gestation, after the body was discovered and reported by someone collecting cardboard for recycling.

It requires extra effort to listen to women and find out what really happened. Why isn’t that effort being made? Natalia Saralegui Ferrante, University of Buenos Aires

La China is now on trial for killing her baby. If convicted, she faces life in prison. “Every time I hear what they’re accusing me of, I think ‘that’s not me’,” she told a panel of three judges last month. “I don’t feel as if I killed anyone. I have a health issue.”

Her story is part of what activists, lawyers, and doctors say is the continued criminalisation of women who suffer obstetric emergencies in Argentina, despite the liberalisation of abortion laws in recent years.

In 2020 the country legalised abortion up to 14 weeks, and later in circumstances such as rape or of health risk to the mother. The government also promised to drop charges against women being prosecuted under earlier abortion laws. A 2020 study found that more than 1,500 women had been accused of or charged for having terminations between 2012 and 2020.

But the new freedoms have not extended to women charged with homicide for undergoing what lawyers and supporters claim are actually miscarriages, stillbirths, or other complications. The same study found at least 37 women had faced charges – either for homicide, or abandonment of a person – for possible obstetric events. The Centre of Legal and Social Studies (CELS) in Buenos Aires said poor, migrant women are more likely to face prosecution.

Natalia Saralegui Ferrante, a law professor at the University of Buenos Aires, says she knows of at least six other women who, like La China, are imprisoned or awaiting trial for obstetric emergencies in Argentina – three of the women are serving life sentences for homicide.

“These seven stories we know about are surely not the only ones,” says Ferrante. “It’s very grave that there are women in jail for acts that are not crimes.”

Human rights groupshave begun travelling around the country, visiting jails and advocates to identify other cases and offer legal support to women.

Society needs to understand that everybody goes through a pregnancy and maternity differently Rosana Fanjul, Libres las Queremos commission

La China’s husband contacted Ferrante after seeing the book she had co-authored about imprisoned women, called Dicen Que Tuve Un Bebé (They Say I Had a Baby). Ferrante says she regularly hears from people seeking help.

“We are talking about women who are being arbitrarily detained in our country because they lived through births and abortions that are outside the conventional narratives,” she says. It requires extra effort to listen to women and find out what really happened. My question is why is that extra effort not being made?”

Soledad Deza, a lawyer in Tucumán province, has been involved in numerous cases where women have been prosecuted for obstetric emergencies, including a 30-year-old who was recently acquitted of murder after spending nine months on remand.

“These stories happen, that’s why we have to raise the alarm about them, and we have to train more feminist lawyers,” she says.

“This keeps happening because the more conservative sectors of society are deeply rooted in the judicial system,” says Rosana Fanjul, a member of the Libres las Queremos commission, part of the campaign for legal abortion. “Society needs to understand that everybody goes through a pregnancy and maternity differently.”

After two years on remand, La China was released from jail last week and placed under house arrest for the rest of the trial, which is expected to end in mid-December.

“I want people to wake up and realise that there are a lot of women who don’t realise that they are pregnant. I’m not the only one,” La China wrote in a letter read out to the court. “We’re innocent.”

98,Tax fraud verdict again exposes illusion of Trump the master businessman,"When sorrows come, Shakespeare observed, they come not single spies, but in battalions. The same goes for former US president Donald Trump’s legal troubles.

The latest trouble for Trump strikes at the heart of his identity as a wealthy businessman who wrote the bestselling book The Art of the Deal. On Tuesday his company was convicted of a 15-year criminal scheme to defraud tax authorities.

“Add tax fraud to the long list of Trump’s accomplishments,” tweeted Adam Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee.

The case centered on charges that the Trump Organization, which operates hotels, golf courses and other assets around the world, paid personal expenses like rent and car leases for top executives without reporting the income, and paid them bonuses as if they were independent contractors.

Trump himself was not charged but prosecutors alleged that he “knew exactly what was going on”. During his closing argument, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass showed jurors a lease Trump signed for a company-paid apartment and a memo Trump initialed authorising a pay cut for another executive who got perks.

“Mr Trump is explicitly sanctioning tax fraud,” Steinglass argued.

In a normal political universe, such a revelation would sink Trump’s hopes of a White House comeback in 2024. But given that he once boasted he could shoot someone in the middle of New York’s Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes, explicitly sanctioning tax fraud might not quite cut it.

Indeed, as comedian Dave Chappelle noted in a recent Saturday Night Live monologue, Trump has turned his ability to bend and break rules into a political virtue. “He said, ‘I know the system is rigged because I use it.’” When Hillary Clinton accused him of not paying taxes, Trump retorted: “That makes me smart.”

In Chappelle’s view, this rare willingness to expose what goes on behind the doors of the rich man’s club endeared Trump to working-class voters in 2016. The implication is that you would do it too, if you could, so good on him.

But six years later, the political landscape is different and the act is looking tired to many, even – increasingly – in his own party. No previous former US president, and no previous presidential candidate, has faced such a mountain of allegations and investigations.

The Trump Organization also separately faces a fraud lawsuit brought by New York state attorney general Letitia James. She wrote on Twitter on Tuesday: “Today’s guilty verdict against the Trump Organization shows that we will hold individuals and organizations accountable when they violate our laws to line their pockets.”

Trump himself is being investigated by the justice department over his handling of sensitive government documents after he left office in January 2021 and his attempts to overturn the November 2020 election, which he lost to Joe Biden.

A prosecutor in Georgia is scrutinising Trump and his allies over an attempt to subvert democracy in that state. Last month the US supreme court cleared the way for the handover of the former president’s tax returns to a congressional committee.

In the attrition of legal trench warfare, these cases may be gradually wearing down Trump’s political resilience, especially combined with three successive elections that suggest he is more of a loser than a winner.

His winning argument in 2016 was that, having cultivated the image of a successful businessman on his reality TV show The Apprentice, he could now bring the same acumen to governing the country. And in a sense, he did: with fraud, deceit and contempt for the rule of law.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/trump-organization-tax-fraud-guilty-verdict-analysis,2022-12-06T00:00:00
99,"‘Sussex, lies and videotape’: papers on the attack over Harry and Meghan documentary","With just days to go until the Duke and Duchess of Sussex release their Netflix series, newspapers are turning a documentary about how the media treated the couple into a story about how the couple are treating the media.

Monday’s release of a second trailer promoting the show has already led to suggestions of misleading editing, with several photos and clips taken out of context in the promotional video for the six-part show entitled Harry and Meghan.

“There’s a leaking but there’s also planting of stories … It’s a dirty game,” says Prince Harry in the trailer, as flashbulbs break over a variety of archive and stock images.

The Sun – one of the publications singled out in the trailer – ran the story on its front page under the headline “Sussex, lies and videotape”. While some of the manipulations are small – a photo of Harry surrounded by paparazzi was cropped from an old picture with his ex Chelsy Davy, rather than with Meghan – some are more unusual. Two pieces of footage showing a scrum of cameras are taken from very different stories. One is from outside a magistrates court in Sussex where cameras were waiting to catch the glamour model Katie Price, another is footage of Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen leaving his New York apartment.

Another shot showing dozens of photographers with long-lens cameras jostling for position was in reality taken outside a Harry Potter film premiere in 2011. It is one of the top results for “paparazzi” on a popular stock image website.

Robert Jobson, the Evening Standard’s royal editor, criticised another dramatic shot of a photographer’s lens peering down on the couple with their newborn child Archie. Jobson insisted it was taken with their approval by an accredited press photographer at Archbishop Tutu’s residence in Cape Town. He tweeted: “Only three people were in the accredited position. H & M [Harry and Meghan] agreed the position. I was there.”

This photograph used by @Netflix and Harry and Meghan to suggest intrusion by the press is a complete travesty. It was taken from a accredited pool at Archbishop Tutu’s residence in Cape Town. Only 3 people were in the accredited position. H & M agreed the position. I was there. pic.twitter.com/nvjznlloLF — Robert Jobson (@theroyaleditor) December 5, 2022

Chris Ship, ITV’s royal editor, backed Jobson: “The filming of Archie at Archbishop Tutu’s residence was highly controlled. And the ITN Productions camera filming the Sussexes’ Africa documentary was there with their permission. It was not a media scrum. They spoke to [ITV news anchor] Tom Bradby inside.”

The issue, in part, is whether this still felt like press intrusion to the couple – even if it was done with the approval of their then aides. Netflix declined to comment on suggestions the footage was misleading.

Because the show is being made for Netflix – rather than a British television channel – it is not bound by the UK’s broadcast standards code. Under British rules, which are overseen by Ofcom, factual programmes “must not materially mislead the audience” or risk being in breach.

Whether using stock images of camera scrums to illustrate press intrusion would count as a material breach of those rules is unclear. But British television executives live in fear of repeating the BBC’s 2007 mistake, when a misleading trailer apparently showed Queen Elizabeth II storming out of a photoshoot with Annie Liebowitz and incident which led to the resignation of BBC One’s then controller, Peter Fincham.

It may not help coverage of the Sussexes that they are suing the majority of British newspaper proprietors on various grounds, having long ago dropped any pretence that they wish to abide by the traditional rules of royal media engagement. Harry is bringing phone-hacking cases against both News UK (which owns the Sun and the Times) and Reach (which owns the Mirror, Express, and Daily Star). He is also one of a number of prominent individuals who are making serious allegations against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday, and MailOnline.

Meghan has already won a separate legal case against the Mail on Sunday after it published a private letter she sent to her father. Only the parent companies of the Guardian, Daily Telegraph and the Financial Times are not publicly known to be involved in legal battles with the couple.

On Tuesday, Harry paused a separate libel battle against the Mail on Sunday. He says a story they ran about funding for his security team is libellous but the Mail’s publisher is contesting the claim on the basis the article expressed an “honest opinion” and did not cause serious reputational harm.

In a sign of the enormous sums that Harry is willing to spend on these legal cases, the court heard the royal has already paid £340,000 in legal fees for this single case and has budgeted up to £1.2m if the case goes to trial. The two sides will continue negotiations to reach a settlement until 20 January next year – by which point all six episodes of Harry and Meghan, setting out their views on the British media, will have been seen by millions.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/06/sussex-lies-and-videotape-papers-on-the-attack-over-harry-and-meghan-documentary,2022-12-06T00:00:00

104,What’s gone wrong with England’s water? – podcast,"More untreated sewage is being pumped into England’s seas and rivers than ever before. Sandra Laville follows the money to find out who is responsible

Becky Malby lives in Ilkley, a town just south of York built around a waterway. It’s an old Victorian spa town once famed for the quality of its waters. Not any more. Now untreated sewage spews into the water where children like to play in summer. It’s becoming a familiar scene in England’s seas and rivers.

To understand how we got here, you need to look back to the privatisation of the water industry in the 1980s. As the environment correspondent Sandra Laville tells Nosheen Iqbal, decades of underinvestment have left England’s waterways at the mercy of storm surges and other environmental factors. Meanwhile, billions of pounds are being paid out to shareholders of the companies responsible, many of which are based offshore and abroad.

As public attention and anger grows, is there an argument for returning water to public ownership? And is there a realistic route to making it happen?

In response to our reporting, water companies said the industry was investing record amounts of private money into the sector. Yorkshire, Southern and Thames said they had not paid dividends for seven, five and five years respectively. Yorkshire said it was not expecting to pay dividends during its five-year business plan period to 2025.

121,Health officials gain guardianship of baby whose parents refused ‘vaccinated blood’ transfusion,"A New Zealand high court judge has ruled in favour of health authorities who sought guardianship of a baby boy after his parents refused to consent to a transfusion of “vaccinated blood” in a life-saving operation.

The landmark decision, delivered on Thursday, is expected to have wide-ranging ramifications and has become a focus of protests for anti-vaxxers who held demonstrations outside the courtroom.

The six-month-old known as Baby W will not survive without urgent surgery for a congenital heart defect. His parents said they were unwilling to proceed unless they were given a guarantee he would only receive blood from unvaccinated donors.

New Zealand’s health authorities and blood service argued that allowing the parents to refuse vaccinated blood would set a dangerous precedent, in which patients could demand to pick and choose where their blood came from.

The high court decision places the boy in the guardianship of his paediatric heart surgeon and cardiologist “for the purpose of consenting to surgery to address the obstruction and all medical issues related to that surgery, including the administration of blood” said Justice Ian Gault in a summary of the judgment.

That guardianship will last from Wednesday until completion of his surgery and post-operative recovery – likely to be January 2023 at the latest. The parents will retain guardianship in all other matters.

In previous interviews the parents said the baby needed surgery “almost immediately” but that they were “extremely concerned with the blood [the doctors] are going to use”.

Vaccines to prevent severe disease and death from Covid-19 have been found to be extremely safe and effective, with millions of people around the world vaccinated.

The judge noted that New Zealand’s blood service had presented evidence from the past six months of a “significant increase in potential blood recipients asking for blood from unvaccinated donors or asking about directed donation. Similar trends have been noted in other countries.”

The case was filed by the Auckland health service Te Whatu Ora. In a statement last week, interim director Dr Mike Shepherd said: “The decision to make an application to the court is always made with the best interests of the child in mind.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/health-officials-gain-guardianship-of-baby-whose-parents-refused-vaccinated-blood-transfusion,2022-12-07T00:00:00

123,"Raphael Warnock wins Georgia runoff, bolstering Democratic Senate majority","The Democratic incumbent, Raphael Warnock, won the Georgia Senate runoff on Tuesday, securing his first full term and delivering a 51st seat to bolster his party’s majority in the chamber.

The Associated Press called the race about three and a half hours after polls closed in Georgia, as Warnock led the Republican candidate, Herschel Walker, by approximately 40,000 votes.

Shortly after that, Warnock took the stage at his campaign’s victory party to thank his supporters. The senior pastor at the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr once preached, Warnock has held one of Georgia’s two Senate seats since winning a special election in 2021. As he began his remarks in Atlanta, supporters chanted: “Six more years!”

Warnock told the crowd: “After a hard-fought campaign – or should I say campaigns – it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy: the people have spoken.”

One of 12 children born to a father who was also a pastor and a mother who once picked cotton, Warnock reflected on the unlikelihood of his path to the Senate. His mother was with him at his victory party, after she had the opportunity to again cast a ballot for her son.

“I am Georgia,” Warnock said. “I am an example and an iteration of its history, of its pain and its promise, of the brutality and the possibility. But because this is America, because we always have a path to make our country greater against unspeakable odds, here we stand together. Thank you, Georgia.”

Joe Biden called Warnock to congratulate him, describing his victory as a defeat of Republican extremism and Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” philosophy.

“Tonight Georgia voters stood up for our democracy, rejected Ultra MAGAism, and most importantly: sent a good man back to the Senate,” the president said on Twitter.

Walker conceded, acknowledging that his campaign had fallen short and expressing gratitude to his team. The Republican explicitly thanked election officials who ensured the runoff was managed effectively, quelling concerns he might refuse to accept the result.

“I don’t want any of you to stop believing in America,” Walker told supporters. “I want you to believe in America and continue to believe in the constitution and believe in our elected officials … Always, always cast your vote no matter whatever is happening.”

Walker’s loss came a month after the national midterm elections, when neither he nor Warnock secured enough support to win outright, thus requiring the runoff. The runoff was just the latest in a series of very close races in Georgia, reflecting the state’s relatively new status as a toss-up after decades of being considered safely Republican.

Nearly 2 million Georgians cast ballots before election day, and those early voters appeared to significantly favor Warnock. Republicans were counting on a strong election day turnout, but Walker’s support on Tuesday was not enough to get him across the line.

The race had been upended several times by controversy surrounding Walker, a former University of Georgia and NFL football player who won the Republican primary after receiving Trump’s endorsement.

Multiple women previously in relationships with Walker accused him of pressuring them to have abortions, despite his staunch anti-abortion views. In the final weeks of the runoff, Walker also faced questions over reports that he received a tax break intended for primary residences on his home in Texas.

Walker’s defeat will probably intensify questions over Trump’s standing in the Republican party. Overall, Trump-endorsed candidates fared poorly in this election season, prompting questions from some of the former president’s critics over whether he has pushed his party to an unpopular extreme.

Walker’s failure will be particularly worrisome for Trump given that Republicans swept other top statewide races in Georgia. Two of those candidates, the incumbent governor, Brian Kemp, and secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, attracted Trump’s ire for pushing back against his efforts to overturn Biden’s 2020 victory, the first time a Democrat took Georgia since 1992.

Before the result was called, the former Republican congressman Will Hurd said on Twitter: “If Walker loses tonight, it will be the sixth time in a row a Democrat beat Trump or a Trump-endorsed statewide candidate in Georgia. It’s time to move on, build the future with conservative principles, and get rid of the crazy bullshit.”

Some rightwing leaders suggested the runoff result raised questions about Trump’s hopes of recapturing the White House, after he announced a third consecutive presidential bid last month.

“Conservatives across the country are tired of losing,” Bob Vander Plaats, president of the group the Family Leader, said on Twitter. “#2024 is key to winning the future again. #ChooseWell.”

The runoff did not determine control of the Senate, as Democrats had already won enough seats to maintain their hold for two years.

But Warnock’s victory does give Democrats a crucial 51st seat, allowing them to abandon their current power-sharing agreement with Republicans. A 51- to 49-seat majority will also provide some wiggle room when it comes to close committee votes and nomination fights. That new dynamic could make the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, less reliant on centrists like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to pass legislation and confirm nominees.

The fortified majority could also help Democrats offer a counterweight to investigations expected to be launched by House Republicans, who took the majority in the lower chamber after the midterms last month. Now that they have a clear majority in the Senate, Democrats will be able to issue subpoenas without Republican support.

“51!” Schumer said in a joyous tweet. He later added: “Senator Warnock’s well-earned victory is a victory for Georgia, and a victory for democracy and against MAGA Republican extremist policies.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/georgia-senate-runoff-polls-closing-raphael-warnock-herschel-walker,2022-12-06T00:00:00
124,Warnock’s win in Georgia is a bad omen for Trump – but there’s no room for complacency,"Sanity strikes again.

Raphael Warnock’s victory over Herschel Walker in the Georgia Senate runoff caps an election season in which the normal, the sensible and the fans of fact regained their voice and gave hope that, after long years in which American democracy was feared to be at death’s door, the patient is rallying.

In simple mathematics, the win gives Democrats 51 seats to Republicans’ 49 in the Senate, speeding up confirmation of Joe Biden’s administrative and judicial nominees and starving the conservative West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin of some of the oxygen he enjoys as the swing vote.

But more philosophically, it serves as another corrective to the notion that all America suddenly went mad on 8 November 2016, the day Donald Trump was elected instead of Hillary Clinton. Looking back, it’s pertinent to recall that Trump lost the popular vote by nearly three million and benefited from a unique cocktail of circumstances that included entrenched misogyny and running against the ultimate establishment politician.

Since then, election after election has demonstrated that Trump’s brand was never what the majority of Americans wanted. Admittedly he improved his vote total in 2020, but he still lost to Joe Biden by seven million. The rout of Trump-endorsed election deniers in last month’s midterms has made even some Republicans understand that the man who despises “losers” is the biggest loser of all.

In a normal political universe, then, Walker’s defeat on Tuesday would be the final nail in Trump’s political coffin. The former American football star was the ultimate Trumpian candidate: a political neophyte famous for something entirely unrelated to politics; braggadocious claims of business acumen; scandals over abusive behaviour towards women and hypocrisy over abortion; weird and wild statements on random topics.

Visiting Georgia while Biden and Trump stayed away, Barack Obama observed: “Since the last time I was here, Mr Walker has been talking about issues that are of great importance to the people of Georgia. Like whether it’s better to be a vampire or a werewolf. This is a debate that I must confess I once had myself. When I was seven. Then I grew up.”

In the Trump era it has become a commonplace that “nothing matters”. Tuesday’s result suggests that some things do matter after all. In particular, candidate quality still matters.

This explains why, even though Republicans won every statewide election in Georgia last month, Biden beat Trump here in 2020 and Democrats won both Senate seats in 2021 thanks to Warnock and Jon Ossoff. (When primaries are thrown in, Warnock has now won six elections in just two years.)

Candidate quality is a two-way street. Walker did not just lose the election. Warnock won it, outworking and outraising his opponent, touting his work on issues such as maternal mortality, highlighting his record in helping propel Biden’s legislative agenda through the Senate and deftly choosing when to ignore Walker and when to put the boot in.

At a rally at a church in Gainesville on Sunday, Warnock asked: “How do you tell your children to tell the truth – and vote for Herschel Walker, who won’t tell you the truth about the basic facts of his life? I’m in church, so that’s all I’m going to say about that.”

Warnock, 53, the first Black senator from Georgia, has now secured a full six-year term and a place among the Democrats’ rising stars. Every candidate needs a story and he has one, telling how his octogenarian mother used her “hands that once picked somebody else’s cotton” to “cast a ballot for her youngest son to be a United States senator”, adding: “Only in America is my story possible.”

He is also a powerful orator, a skill honed as senior minister of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist church, where Martin Luther King Jr used to preach, and joins faith-driven liberals such as Pete Buttigieg and the Rev William Barber in challenging the Christian right’s dominance of the moral agenda. Warnock is fond of saying: “I’m not a senator that used to be a pastor. I’m a pastor who happens to serve in the Senate.”



Even so, after Thursday it is still a case, as EM Forster put it, of two cheers for democracy rather than three. Trump arguably remains the favourite for the Republican nomination in 2024. His party has just regained a majority in the House of Representatives and is teeing up partisan investigations aplenty. In more ordinary times, it would have seemed unthinkable that a candidate such as Walker could come anywhere close to a runoff in the first place.



Which means there is no room for complacency and everything to play for. The next election could spell the rebirth or the death of Trumpism. And nowhere will do more to tip the scales towards hope or despair than Georgia.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/raphael-warnock-wins-herschel-walker-loss-bad-news-trump,2022-12-06T00:00:00
125,Health experts in conundrum over best way to avoid winter ‘tripledemic’,"Dr Jason Newland, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at St Louis children’s hospital, is just waiting for his cold to start. “I can list off about 10 people right now that have had some sort of illness in the past five days,” Newland said.

That’s because the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza seasons started months earlier than usual, amid the continuing spread of Covid-19 and the common cold. The flu hospitalization rate is the highest it’s been in a decade, according to public health officials. Scientists have described the collision of viruses as a “tripledemic”.

“This is an extraordinary event, and it is stressing the health care resources in many parts of the country very, very substantially,” said William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.

Fortunately, despite their concerns, public health officials are not calling for people to socially distance and avoid holiday gatherings, as many of them did earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to increased isolation and sometimes harmed people’s mental health. Instead, they say there are other measures individuals should take to avoid spreading the viruses and becoming severely ill as meeting outdoors becomes harder in the winter.

“I think the vast majority of people can gather and do it safely, and there are tools available to make it safer,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.

The populations that are most at risk from the viruses are babies, young children and older adults, the infectious disease experts said. The unseasonal spike in cases of flu and RSV, likely due to the social distancing and masking employed during the pandemic, have overwhelmed children’s hospitals around the country, according to public health officials.

At the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, there has been an influx of babies and young children with one or more of the viruses who are struggling to breathe and need supplemental oxygen to stay safe and sometimes must be admitted to the hospital, said Dr Rachel Pearson, assistant professor of pediatrics.

In addition to the viruses, pediatric hospitals must also treat adolescents who end up in the emergency room because of self-inflicted injuries, and the numbers have increased significantly over the last decade, according to the New York Times.

That volume of pediatric patients due to viruses and self-harm has forced healthcare providers to get creative with space at the hospital, Pearson said.

“Usually when you get admitted, you go upstairs from the ER to a regular hospital room, but if all the regular hospital rooms are full, then the kid will stay” in the emergency room under the care of hospitalists such as Pearson and her team, who would normally see them elsewhere, she said. “Every hospitalist I’ve talked to anywhere is dealing with” pediatric bed shortages.

As for adults over age 65, Nuzzo is concerned because of the low uptake of the second Covid-19 vaccine booster. Only about one-third of that population has received the most recent booster, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“It’s surprisingly low for that age group, despite the fact that that age group has typically had high vaccination coverage,” Nuzzo said.

And getting the latest Covid-19 vaccine booster and the flu vaccine is one of the best ways people can protect themselves from the viruses, the experts said.

“Neither of these vaccines is perfect,” Schaffner said. “Both of them are very good. They do their best in preventing the complications, the most serious aspects of these illnesses, so they are clearly of value to the individual. Both of them also, to a degree, diminish transmission, so they contribute to the general health of families and communities.”

Still, public health officials are not urging people to socially distance to avoid overwhelming hospitals as they often were during Covid-19 surges.

But to gather more safely, they recommend that people use rapid Covid-19 tests.

“In addition to obliging everybody to be vaccinated who attends, ask people to take a rapid test the morning of the get-together and say, ‘If you’re negative, come celebrate. If you’re not, we’ll contact you on FaceTime,’” Schaffner suggested.

The idea of staying home when sick also, of course, applies to flu and RSV.

“If the grandchildren become snotty-nosed kids – that is they get sick with a respiratory infection – that’s not the time to visit grandma,” Schaffner said. “If you do become ill, please do not go to work, school, the gym, religious services or other communal gatherings because you will be a dreaded spreader.”

The infectious disease experts also recommended that people frequently wash their hands. Unlike Covid-19, RSV lives on surfaces.

Masking can also be a helpful tool. But Nuzzo recognizes that a lot of people don’t want to mask around their families any more.

On a ferry ride to a Thanksgiving gathering, Nuzzo sat indoors because it was cold and wore a mask because it was crowded. But once there, she and her family did not wear masks.

Masking “adds safety for sure. As does opening the windows, as does testing, as does having air filtration devices running, as does gathering outdoors instead of indoors”, Nuzzo said. “Those things all still help, but I think people are making decisions differently about whether that feels worth it to them.”

Fortunately, there are indications that the RSV season could soon reach its peak and begin falling, according to the infectious disease experts. And for Covid-19, there is less vulnerability because of the number of people who have been vaccinated against it and contracted the virus, Nuzzo said.

“If people want to be as safe as possible, wear masks,” Newland said. “We know that will protect people. And so I really think we have to come to individual decisions and choices and then respect one another.”

If someone says, ‘I have some high-risk people in my home, I would prefer that you wear a mask,’ then that’s what we should be doing,” Newland added.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/07/rsv-covid-19-flu-tripledemic-social-distancing-masks,2022-12-07T00:00:00
126,US supreme court hears case that could radically reshape elections,"The US supreme court is hearing arguments on Wednesday in a case with the potential to fundamentally reshape elections for Congress and the presidency.

The justices are mulling over the power of state courts to strike down congressional districts drawn by the legislature because they violate state constitutions.

Republicans from North Carolina who are bringing the case argue that a provision of the US constitution known as the elections clause gives state lawmakers virtually total control over the “times, places and manner” of congressional elections, including redistricting, and cuts state courts out of the process.

The Republicans are advancing a concept called the “independent state legislature theory”, never before adopted by the supreme court but cited approvingly by four conservative justices.

A broad ruling could threaten hundreds of election laws, require separate rules for federal and state elections on the same ballot and lead to new efforts to redraw congressional districts to maximize partisan advantage.

The court’s decision in the North Carolina case also might suggest how the justices would deal with another part of the constitution – not at issue in the current case – that gives legislatures the authority to decide how presidential electors are appointed.

That provision, the electors clause, was central to efforts to try to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in several closely contested states.

The North Carolina state supreme court struck down districts drawn by Republicans who control the legislature because they heavily favored Republicans in the highly competitive state. The court-drawn map used in last month’s elections for Congress produced a 7-7 split between Democrats and Republicans.

North Carolina is among six states in recent years in which state courts have ruled that overly partisan redistricting for Congress violated their state constitutions. The others are Florida, Maryland, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

State courts have become the only legal forum for challenging partisan congressional maps since the supreme court ruled in 2019 that those lawsuits cannot be brought in federal court.

In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers will not have to wait for the court’s decision to produce a new congressional map that is expected to have more Republican districts.

Even as Democrats won half the state’s 14 congressional seats, Republicans seized control of the state supreme court. Two newly elected Republican justices give them a 5-2 edge that makes it more likely than not that the court would uphold a map with more Republican districts.",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/dec/07/us-supreme-court-elections-case-independent-state-legislature-theory,2022-12-07T00:00:00
127,Argentina’s Cristina Fernández sentenced to six years in $1bn fraud case,"Argentina’s vice-president and former president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, has been sentenced to six years in prison and given a lifelong ban on holding public office after being found guilty in a $1bn fraud case related to public works.

Fernández de Kirchner – who was president of Argentina for two terms between 2007 and 2015 – was found guilty of fraud on Tuesday, though she is unlikely to serve any prison time soon as she has immunity due to her government roles and is expected to launch a lengthy appeals process that could take years.

A three-judge panel rejected a second charge of running a criminal organization, for which a guilty verdict could have taken her full sentence to 12 years in prison. The sentence marked the first time an Argentinian vice-president has been convicted of a crime while in office.

In a live stream after the verdict was announced, Fernández de Kirchner said that the charges against her were politically motivated. “It is clear that the idea was always to convict me,” she said. “This is a parallel state and mafia.”

Fernández de Kirchner – who many had expected to run for president next year – also said: “I won’t be a candidate for anything, not president, not senator. My name will not be on any ballot.”

The former president described the proceedings against her as “law-fare”, which political analysts in the region describe as a form of “political warfare” involving politicians, the judiciary and the media, usually with a view to smearing leftist leaders as corrupt.

The verdict is certain to deepen fissures in Argentina, where the 69-year-old populist dominates the political landscape and recently survived an assassination attempt after her assailant’s gun apparently jammed. Last month, Fernández de Kirchner compared her judges to a “firing squad”.

Fernández de Kirchner was accused of arranging for 51 public works contracts in the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz to be awarded to a company belonging to Lázaro Báez, a friend and business associate of Fernández and her late husband, former president Néstor Kirchner, who ruled Argentina from 2003-2007.

“I think this is an important judgment that shows the robbery there was in Argentina,” Patricia Bullrich, leader of the rightwing opposition party Republican Proposal (PRO) told the Guardian. “For years, [Fernández de Kirchner] has been trying to confuse corruption and robbery … with a political trial. A political trial is when someone is detained for their ideas. Here, there was concrete robbery.”

Prosecutors said the Báez company was created to embezzle revenues through false bidding processes for projects that suffered from cost overruns – and in many cases were never completed.

Báez, who was also sentenced to six years alongside Fernández de Kirchner, was convicted of money laundering in February 2021 and is currently under house arrest as he appeals against his conviction.

Fernández de Kirchner is a profoundly divisive figure in Argentinian politics. She and her husband were members of the so-called “pink tide” of leftwing presidents that ruled many Latin American countries at the start of the century, alongside figures such as Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Chile’s Michele Bachelet.

The Kirchners’ supporters credit them with implementing progressive economic policies that improved life for the poor and helped steer Argentina back to prosperity following a cataclysmic economic collapse in 2001 and 2002.

But her detractors have long accused Fernández de Kirchner of corruption, and the verdict will do little to change deeply entrenched opinions, said Dr Sebastián Giorgi, an Argentinian semiotician who has studied discourse around the trial.

“Those who already thought she was corrupt will keep thinking what they think, and those who think she wasn’t, will keep thinking the same, too,” he said. He pointed out that public trust in Argentina’s judiciary is low and the public, especially young people, are more likely to form their opinions from social media.

This verdict is the first time Fernández de Kirchner has been convicted. But she has previously been charged in numerous other cases in which she was either acquitted before the case went to trial or the cases were dismissed.

These include accusations that she colluded with the Iranian government to cover up Tehran’s involvement a 1994 bomb attack, in which 85 people were killed at the AMIA Jewish cultural centre.

The most recent case against her is the “Notebooks” scandal, in which she is alleged to have awarded public works contracts in exchange for kickbacks.

At 4am one night in July 2016, Fernández de Kirchner’s former public works secretary José López was caught trying to stash bin bags containing $8.9m in cash in a nunnery on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.

In a survey conducted in November by the polling firm Zuban Córdoba y Asociados, 61.9% of respondents said that they had a negative image of Fernández de Kirchner. Her supporters have promised to paralyze the country with mass protests.

The judges will publish the reasoning behind their decision in 2023.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-argentina-sentenced-prison-fraud-case,2022-12-06T00:00:00
128,Five women file new lawsuit accusing Bill Cosby of sexual assault,"Five women who have long accused Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting them early in their careers have filed the latest lawsuit against the 85-year-old comedian and this one calls NBCUniversal, a studio and a production company, complicit in the abuse.

The lawsuit comes more than a year after Cosby left prison after his 2018 sexual assault conviction in Pennsylvania was overturned. This year, a Los Angeles jury awarded $500,000 to a woman who said Cosby had sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 1975, when she was a teenager.

The lawsuit filed Monday under New York’s one-year window for adults to file sexual abuse complaints involves the accusers Lili Bernard, Eden Tirl, Jewel Gittens, Jennifer Thompson and Cindra Ladd. The lawsuit alleges that each woman was abused or assaulted by the actor after meeting him on set or through other entertainment circles in the late 1960s through the 1990s.

“It was well known that Bill Cosby would regularly take young women into his dressing room, and when you read the complaint, you’ll see there were instances where staff saw this happening and even encouraged the plaintiff to submit,” said the lawyer Jordan Rutsky, who represents all five women.

“This was not a hidden secret that Bill Cosby was doing these things,” Rutsky said. “It was just accepted.”

The lawsuit alleged that NBC, Kaufman Astoria Studios and Carsey-Werner Television “facilitated the sexual assault of women” by failing to check Cosby’s power and proclivities, and failed to protect the women from being alone with him, because they profited from his work.

In at least some of the cases, the lawsuit said, Cosby first drugged the woman through drinks or pills he provided. A Cosby spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, said the “accusers have resurfaced to file a frivolous civil lawsuit” against Cosby.

A spokeswoman for NBCUniversal, the network that aired The Cosby Show from 1984 to 1992, said the company would not comment on legal issues. Neither Kaufman Astoria nor Carsey-Werner immediately returned phone or email messages left on Tuesday afternoon seeking comment.

“This isn’t about justice for victims of alleged sexual assault, it’s all about money,” Wyatt said in a statement, echoing the defense arguments in Cosby’s criminal retrial, when the Pennsylvania jury convicted him of drugging and sexually assaulting a Temple University employee at his Philadelphia-area home in 2004.

Cosby served nearly three years in prison before the state supreme court overturned the conviction, finding that he gave incriminating testimony in a deposition about the encounter only after believing he had immunity from prosecution. The trial judge and an intermediate appeals court had found no evidence of such immunity.

Bernard, who played Mrs Minifield on The Cosby Show in the early 1990s, also has a pending lawsuit against Cosby in New Jersey over an alleged encounter in Atlantic City.

Seven other accusers received a settlement from Cosby’s insurers in the wake of the Pennsylvania conviction over a defamation lawsuit they had filed in Massachusetts. Their lawsuit said that Cosby and his agents disparaged them in denying their allegations of abuse.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/bill-cosby-lawsuit-sexual-assault-accusation,2022-12-06T00:00:00
129,"‘Dark activities’ of Russian-linked oil tankers have doubled, analysis shows","The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Atlantic has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions.

By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged.

A $60 (£50) a barrel ceiling on purchases of Russian oil came into force on Monday. Companies in the EU, the UK, US, Canada and Japan as well as Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, in cases where the price cap has been breached.

The G7 nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US – provide insurance services for 90% of the world’s cargo while Greece, an EU member state, is a major player in the shipping industry.

The cap is aimed at maintaining the flow of oil to countries such as China, India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, which have not banned Russian oil imports, while maintaining economic pressure on the Kremlin.

A traffic jam of oil tankers built up in Turkish waters on Monday as Turkey’s government demanded proof of insurance cover.

The monthly average of both so-called dark activities and ship-to-ship operations in the south Atlantic doubled in the September to November period compared with the previous three months, according to an analysis of movements by the maritime intelligence company Windward. There were around 35 incidents of ‘dark activity’ in September, nearly 50 in October and numbers dipped to just over 40 in November.

Tankers able to hide any Russian links, by illicit transfers mid-ocean, would hope to avoid any price attestation of their cargo.

Ami Daniel, the chief executive of Windward, said Russia had been learning from Iran and North Korea over the past six months on how to circumvent sanctions.

He said: “We are seeing a growing cycle of learning and adoption of Russian fleet and Russian connected parties.”

The spike in dark activity in the south Atlantic had followed a smaller, and since reversed, period of activity in the north Atlantic, between May and August, he said.

Lloyd’s List then published a report at the end of July suggesting that five Chinese-owned ships were being used to transfer Russian oil at a hub about 860 nautical miles west of Portugal’s coast.

“Immediately we see a change of pattern,” said Daniel. “That’s when we see the uptick in the south Atlantic. These are known methods to avoid sanctions.”

Windward also published what it suggested bore the hallmarks of a live case of Russian oil being transported by a tanker under a Cameroon flag.

The vessel changed its registered owner to a Seychelles-based company in June 2022 along with its call sign before making a first visit to Cape Verde, where it met a few other vessels.

Two weeks later, the tanker moved to the north mid-Atlantic, where it stayed for three days, before heading to the south Atlantic, just outside Namibia’s seas, according to the analysis. It was said to have sent false signals about its location.

The ship then moved in mid-October to within Angola’s seas, where the tanker transmitted from the exact same spot for six days, in what Windward said was unusual behaviour for a tanker at sea, before heading towards Asia and its final destination, the Malaysian port of Tanjung Bruas.

Windward’s analysis suggests that the vessel’s report of a draft change on 20 November, the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of the hull, suggested that oil may have been taken onboard at that stage.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/dark-activities-of-russian-linked-oil-tankers-has-doubled-analysis-shows,2022-12-06T00:00:00
130,"World Cup 2022 Golden Boot: top goalscorers, game by game","The Golden Boot is awarded to the player who scores the most goals in the tournament. If there are multiple players with the same number of goals, the tie is broken by assists, and if those too are equal, by the lowest minutes played.

Own goals do not count, and nor do penalties scored in penalty shoot-outs, but penalties in normal or extra time do.

The World Cup first gave an award to the top goalscorer of the tournament in 1982, under the name Golden Shoe, before being renamed Golden Boot for the 2010 finals (with silver and bronze boots for the second and third places). In that year, Germany’s Thomas Müller collected the award with five goals and three assists. James Rodríguez took the prize four years later with six goals, while Harry Kane’s six-goal haul for England landed the award in 2018.

These all come well short of the leading goalscorer at a single World Cup, which was France’s Just Fontaine, who scored a remarkable 13 goals during the 1958 tournament.

131,Emancipation: the true story behind Will Smith’s slavery drama,"When Will Smith made a guest appearance last week on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, there was no avoiding The Slap – his eruption of anger at comedian Chris Rock during the Oscars. But first, host Trevor Noah wanted to talk about Smith’s latest film: “You play one of the most famous unknown people … from America’s history.”

That person is today known as “whipped Peter” or by his given name as an enslaved man, Gordon. A photograph showing his scarred back after his escape from a Louisiana plantation in the 1860s became one of the first viral images, displaying the brutality of slavery to a world that could no longer look away. Peter’s story is the inspiration for Smith’s comeback movie, Emancipation, which begins streaming on Apple TV+ on Friday.

The backdrop is the American civil war. On 1 January 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation declaring “that all persons held as slaves” within states that had seceded from the union “are, and henceforward shall be free”, though it left slavery untouched in loyal border states. The proclamation also announced the acceptance of Black men into the Union army.

Mary Elliott, curator of American slavery at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, says in an online call: “This war was about slavery, about the ability to maintain slavery, and Lincoln was about keeping the union together.

“Ultimately, he passes the Emancipation Proclamation which freed enslaved Black people only in the rebelling states. That’s a very important distinction. A state like Maryland did not leave the union and still maintained slavery. That meant slavery hadn’t ended throughout the whole nation.”

Peter was in one of the southern states that had rebelled. He was among 40 enslaved people on John and Bridget Lyons’ expansive cotton and onion plantation in St Landry parish, Louisiana. They were subjected to unspeakable cruelty.

In March 1863 Peter staged an extraordinary escape. For 10 days he was on the run, hunters and dogs at his back, disguising his scent with onions and navigating the treacherous bayou. Forty miles later, he finally reached the Union army stationed in Baton Rouge – he was finally a free man.

But before enlisting in a Black regiment, he was examined by military doctors. A witness told the New York Daily Tribune newspaper: “He pulled down the pile of dirty rags that half concealed his back. It sent a thrill of horror to every white person present, but the few blacks who were waiting paid but little attention to the sad spectacle, such terrible scenes being painfully familiar to them all.”

The shocking sight was captured by New Orleans-based photographers William McPherson and J Oliver. In the portrait, which became known as “The Scourged Back”, Peter sits with hand on hip, back to the camera, glancing over his shoulder. His skin is riven with a crisscrossed map of keloid scars from a whipping by a plantation overseer, an act of abuse that Peter said left him in bed for two months.

According to the New York Daily Tribune, he told the Union troops on 2 April 1863: “Overseer Artayou Carrier whipped me – I don’t remember the whipping. I was two months in bed, sore from the whipping and salt brine, which Overseer put on my back. By and by my senses began to come – they said I was sort of crazy, and tried to shoot everybody.”

The photo was published in Harper’s Magazine and created a sensation. It was circulated fervently around the country by abolitionists and published worldwide. Unlike written accounts of slavery, all too often dismissed as unverifiable, the photograph provided incontrovertible and visceral evidence.

Theodore Tilton, a newspaper editor, wrote that it “should be multiplied by the hundred thousand and scattered over the states … If seeing is believing – and it is in the immense majority of cases – seeing this card would be equivalent to believing things of the slave states which Northern men and women would move heaven and earth to abolish!”

The image can be seen a forerunner of mobile phone videos that now capture police brutality against people of colour, spurring the Black Lives Matter movement. Elliott adds: “People try to tell themselves things to make themselves like, ‘Well, slavery wasn’t so bad. The genteel enslaver and the enslaved who loved and cared for their enslaver.’ But let’s just be real. Legally there were opportunities for people to maim a person, even kill a person who was enslaved, who they saw as doing something wrong.

“There were laws in the colonial period where you could split someone’s nose, cut off a limb for different degrees of what the enslavers saw as an egregious act. Legally you could murder someone. There were whipping posts – you could whip someone in public. You can read about it but to see it, that’s a whole different thing. That’s why you can’t turn away. This is real, this man’s back, those lines, those raised lacerations tell a visual story that you can’t turn away from.”

Peter signed up to serve as a soldier in the Louisiana Native Guard, a regiment of the Union army made up entirely of free Black recruits, in an effort to liberate others. He was reported to have fought bravely in the Union assault on Port Hudson in July 1863.

Elliott continues: “That was important for him to be able to do that. His story is powerful because you can’t talk about slavery without talking about freedom. There’s always this desire for freedom. When people say, ‘Oh, another slave film’, ‘Oh, you’re going to talk about slavery’, well, guess what? I’m also going to talk about freedom.”

The trail then goes cold: nothing further is known about Peter’s life. But the photo of him that hangs in the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery continues to agitate, haunt, move, reprove and inspire.

Elliott, 56, who has interviewed Smith about the new film, reflects: “When I see that photograph it makes me think about how it’s important that we’re in touch with our humanity by recognising the inhumanity and we recognise that, with Peter’s story, the strength of a man is endurance, what he experienced, but also the strength of that man is to see the fight through all the way through.

“So now you’ve entered the Union army camp and you’re going to join the fight. To me Black people who did that didn’t just free themselves from slavery. They freed the nation from the bondage of slavery and that cannot be lost on anyone.”",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/07/emancipation-will-smith-slavery-drama,2022-12-07T00:00:00
132,Talk to the animals? Study shows some human understanding of creatures’ sounds,"It might not be animal communication Dr Dolittle-style, but researchers have found humans are able to glean insights into the feelings of creatures including pigs, horses and goats based on their vocalisations.

The team say the findings suggest certain information within sounds, such as how intense an animal’s emotions are, appears to be conveyed in a similar way across species.

“[People] probably base their decisions on their knowledge of how humans sound when they’re more or less aroused … because arousal, which is linked to stress pathways, is a system that is well conserved across vertebrates,” said Dr Elodie Briefer, co-author of the research from the University of Copenhagen.

They also looked whether people could determine whether an animal was expressing a positive or negative emotion.

“We cannot really rely on what we know from humans because it varies a lot between species – there are lots of differences in how species express emotions, even closely related ones,” said Briefer.

Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Briefer and colleagues report how they recorded vocalisations from six animal species – horses, pigs, goats, cattle, Przewalski’s horses (wild horses) and wild boars. The team noted whether the sound was made when the animal was aroused – as determined by a high heart rate or movement – and whether the sound was made in a positive context, such anticipating food, or a negative context, such as being isolated.

For humans, the team used existing recordings of meaningless strings of speech spoken in rage or in fear to represent higher and lower emotional intensity – or arousal – respectively, and in an angry or joyful way to suggest a negative or positive context.

The researchers then asked 1,024 participants from 48 countries to each listen online to pairs of the sounds.

For each species, participants were played four pairs of vocalisations. For two pairs they were asked to rate the emotional intensity of the sound as high or low, while for the other two pairs they were asked to rate the emotion as positive or negative.

The results reveal that, overall, participants correctly rated the emotional intensity of the subject 54.1% of the time, and type of emotion 55.3% of the time.

However when the team analysed the data further, they found the participants only did better than chance on both metrics when assessing vocalisations from pigs, horses, goats, humans, and – for type of emotion only – wild boars.

“People are in general better at recognising domestic than wild species,” said Briefer.

The arousal level of pigs and horses was rated correctly 59% and 58% of the time respectively, compared with 55% for humans, while their type of emotion was rated correctly 58% and 64% of the time respectively, compared with 68% for humans.

“We’re quite confident that when it is higher than chance it is definitely higher than chance,” said Briefer, adding that while ratings might have been high for horses because many participants reported contact with such animals, the relatively low success rate for most species, including humans, could be down to both the brevity of the recordings, and the use of the same type of sound for each pair of vocalisations – such as mooing for cows or whinnying for horses.

Briefer added participants’ success in rating the type of emotions varied far more than their ability to determine the intensity of the emotions.

“If we take it to the next level, we can very likely easily train people to recognise the sounds,” she said, noting that could help those working closely with animals – from farmers to pet owners – to understand them better.

“In the past, scientists used to focus on physical health for assessing animal welfare. Nowadays, most of us recognise the large role that emotions play.”",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/dec/07/talk-to-the-animals-study-shows-some-human-understanding-of-creatures-sounds,2022-12-07T00:00:00

134,The US supreme court is poised to strike another blow against gay rights | Moira Donegan,"It’s not clear what, exactly, Lorie Smith’s problem is. The Colorado woman aspires to be a web designer; apparently, she’s also upset that gay people can get married. Smith is an evangelical Christian who says that her faith makes her object to same-sex marriage.

This wouldn’t be anyone’s problem, except that Smith lives in a state with a robust civil rights law, one that forbids business owners who make their services available to the public from discriminating. But Smith really wants to discriminate: she hopes to be able to turn away gay clients from her as-yet-hypothetical wedding website business; she wants to put a banner at the top of her business homepage proclaiming her unwillingness to design websites for gay weddings. The law would forbid this if she ever went into business, so she’s suing.

As of now, none of this has actually come up. At the time Smith filed her lawsuit, demanding an exemption to her state’s law, she didn’t even have a business with which to discriminate. The law has never been enforced against her; she’s never had the opportunity to discriminate that she so craves. It’s not clear, in other words, that she really has standing to sue – she’s never been forced to provide services to gay people, so, in legal parlance, there’s no “injury” to speak of. But Smith is an angry conservative, and she’s found some very well-funded lawyers from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a huge rightwing legal organization that has embarked on a nationwide campaign of lawsuits to erode civil rights protections for gay people.

The result is 303 Creative v Elenis, a case in which Smith argues that her religious convictions mean that she shouldn’t have to comply with a generally applicable civil rights law, and should be granted license to discriminate by her state. The US supreme court heard oral arguments on Monday, and the 6-3 conservative majority is certain to hand Smith a victory allowing her to deny service to clients based on sexual orientation.

A decision from the court is expected next summer. The question, as happens so often with this rabidly conservative court, is not who is going to win. That question was probably answered the moment the court agreed to hear the case, to the point that briefings and oral arguments in hot-button culture and identity cases like 303 Creative have been rendered largely moot.

The question, instead, is how far the court will go: how much the justices will unravel the anti-discrimination laws that govern public accommodations – that is, the laws that say that businesses which serve the public cannot deny service to people based on their identity – and how much discrimination, humiliation and bigotry in public life they will unleash upon gay Americans. The question is whether the speech that Smith can deploy in any other form of her life – any belief that she already has every right to broadcast online, or in her church, or in writing, or by holding a sign up in the street – is also an opinion she is entitled to enforce through the conduct of her business.

If the 303 Creative case sounds familiar, that’s because it’s more or less a rerun. In 2018, the supreme court heard Masterpiece Cakeshop v Colorado Civil Rights Commission, another case by a business owner challenging the same state law, this time a baker who didn’t want to make a gay couple’s wedding cake. In that case, the court punted, ruling that lower tribunals had mishandled the case, but not making a decision on the merits about whether an individual businessperson’s opinions trumped civil rights law. But the court looked very different in 2018: that punting opinion was written by Anthony Kennedy, who retired soon thereafter and was replaced by his protege, the beer enthusiast Brett Kavanaugh. Since then the court has lurched even further to the right, and has shown a willingness to indulge even the most far-fetched claims of Christian religious litigants.

The Trump justices turned the court from an already conservative institution into a revanchist one with a culture-war axe to grind

But it’s worth considering what the court did not do when it agreed to hear 303 Creative: it did not grant certiorari on Smith’s claim that her religious freedom was violated by the anti-discrimination law. This is unusual, for this court: since the Trump justices joined the court, turning it from what was already a quite conservative institution into a maximalist, revanchist one with a culture-war axe to grind, the court has expanded free-exercise-of-religion rights quite rapidly – at least, so long as those free-exercise rights are being exercised by conservative Christians.

The court has even specifically used the constitution’s free-exercise clause to imply an entitlement to discriminate against homosexuals: in last summer’s Fulton v Philadelphia, the justices ruled that municipal agencies handling the welfare of children in need were obliged to work with a religiously affiliated adoption agency, even though that agency discriminated against gay couples in violation of city civil rights law.

But in 303 Creative the court is only considering Smith’s wish to discriminate as a free speech issue. This opens a new avenue for challenges to civil rights law, and will provide an opportunity for rightwing lawyers to begin unraveling the laws regarding non-discrimination in public accommodations in the wake of the civil rights movement, like pulling on a loose thread to unravel a sweater.

Though Smith wants to discriminate only against gay couples, and other exemptions to civil rights law are likely to focus on allowing open bigotry against LGBTQ+ people to be expressed in commercial life, there is no limiting principle that means that only gay people will be targeted. After all, if a website designer is allowed to decline to make a gay wedding website, what stops her from making the same claim to refuse an interracial wedding, or an interfaith one? Is she allowed to decline to make sites for birth announcements of children born to gay couples, or via IVF?

I keep thinking of the sign that Smith wants to put at the top of her future business’s webpage, the one that says she won’t make websites for gay weddings. It’s essentially an advertisement of her belief in gay people’s inferiority, an effort to exclude them not just from her own goodwill, but from commercial life. How different is such a sign, really, from those that advertised whites-only lunch counters, or the signs that the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recalled seeing in the windows of shops when she went on family road trips as a child: “No dogs and no Jews”.

It has become vogue, in rightwing legal arguments against civil rights law, to speak of the “indignity” imposed on anti-gay business owners who are forced to comply with anti-discrimination law. It’s a shame that the court doesn’t seem poised to consider the indignity of facing discrimination itself.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/06/us-supreme-court-colorado-gay-rights,2022-12-06T00:00:00
135,"Want a better restaurant table? Well, so does everyone else, buddy, you will have to pay for it","It looks like the airline experience you know and hate may be coming to a restaurant near you soon. A new app called Tablz, which is being used by a handful of well-known eateries in the US, lets you pay extra to choose your table at a restaurant. Want a window seat? Well, everyone else wants it too, buddy, so you’d better pay up! How much depends on how many other people are interested: as with ride-sharing apps, prices on Tablz surge with demand.

“The restaurant financial model is broken,” the Tablz co-founder Frazer Nagy told Fast Company. “You can upgrade your hotel room, your car rental … seats on a plane. Every other industry has figured out pricing through upgrades, except restaurants.”

That’s one way of putting it. Another way of putting it is that we live in a world where anything that can possibly be monetised will be monetised. Air travel is the most obvious example. Want to check baggage? That’ll cost you. Want a faster security line? That’ll cost you. Want to choose your seat? That’ll cost you. Want to use the bathroom? Well, that’s still free now, but if Ryanair had its way, it would cost you.

Add-ons aren’t always bad. I don’t mind being in zone nine and boarding a plane last if it saves me money. Increasingly, though, it feels as if you’re expected to pay through the nose for the worst possible experience and then fork out extra to be recognised as a human being. The customer is king? Only if you’re paying for the royal treatment. Otherwise you’re a lowly serf who can suffer.

While we’re all used to being mercilessly divided into castes at the airport, socioeconomic stratification has crept into almost every experience – including, it seems, restaurant seating. Tablz is the latest example of what the reporter Nelson D Schwartz called “the velvet-rope economy”. Pay enough money and you can skip to the front of the line everywhere from amusement parks to hospitals. During the early days of the pandemic, for example, some wealthy Americans spent $40,000 a year for a concierge doctor, which gave them access to Covid tests that were out of the reach of even middle-class Americans with decent health insurance.

Money has always allowed people to buy comfort and bypass inconvenience. Still, it is striking how so much of daily life is now divided into very conspicuous class tiers. Along with healthcare, the most jarring example of the velvet-rope economy is probably those new apartment blocks that have “poor doors”: separate entrances and facilities for the handful of affordable units that allow developers to scoop up government subsidies for their luxury building. It’s in-your-face segregation. One resident told the Daily Mirror she has “never felt poorer in my life because of the way we’re kept apart”.

This sort of socioeconomic segregation can have lifelong ramifications. A recent analysis of billions of Facebook connections suggests childhood friendships between rich kids and poor kids is linked to increased earnings later in life for poor children.

It’s not good for anyone when inequality is rubbed in your face. Again, just look at flying. Boarding a plane often feels like a microcosm of class divisions: you walk through the opulence of business class to get to your cramped little seat at the back. It’s infuriating! And it can make us very angry indeed. A 2016 study found economy-class passengers were almost four times as likely to get air rage if there was a first-class section on the flight.

It’s gonna be great when they replicate that in restaurants! They lead you past the premium seats other punters have paid for to your table by the toilets. “Salt is extra!” the waiter says as they sashay away.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/06/want-a-better-restaurant-table-well-so-does-everyone-else-buddy-you-will-have-to-pay-for-it,2022-12-06T00:00:00
136,The California academic strike is the most important in US higher education history | Nelson Lichtenstein,"The strike by unions representing 48,000 academic workers at the University of California stands at a perilous crossroads. It is by far the largest and most important strike in the history of American higher education, with the potential to transform both the status and income of those who work in an “industry” that now employs more workers than the federal government.

Despite all the disruption, the strike has generated virtually no opposition from either the faculty or from most undergraduates. Indeed, student leaders at all nine University of California campuses have endorsed the demand by their graduate student teaching assistants and other academic workers for a substantial wage increase designed to offset the soaring cost of California housing as well as the larger inflationary riptide that has eroded even the paltry salaries, grants and fellowships upon which so many of them rely.

Most faculty are sympathetic as well, with many joining the picket lines put up each day by the United Automobile Workers, the union representing the separate locals composed of teaching assistants, tutors and readers; postdoctoral scholars and academic researchers. Many of the UC strikers hold that the “A” in UAW really stands for “academic,” certainly in California, where most UAW members are now employed in a university setting.

After three weeks, however, the strike has reached a moment of danger. UC administrators have offered the postdocs and the academic researchers, about 12,000 in number, a set of five-year contracts that modestly increase wages in year one and also provide a set of additional enhancements, including more money for parental leave, childcare benefit and longer appointments. But the graduate student teaching assistants, who compose a large majority of those on strike and who constitute the most militant and activist element among the unionists, have thus far been unable to persuade UC administrators to increase an initial wage offer – 7% now followed by smaller annual increases later on – that barely compensated them for the inflationary erosion of their real incomes.

It’s a divide-and-conquer strategy. Because the federal government pays the salaries of most postdocs and academic researchers – through grants from the National Science Foundation and other funding entities – UC can more easily accede to a wage enhancement, in the case of the postdoctoral students, for more than 20% in the first year, although only 3.5% in subsequent years. But since the teaching assistants, whose current pay is the lowest of all those on strike, are funded directly out of the University budget, school negotiators have taken a hard line.

Adding insult to injury, UC insists upon long contracts for all those now on strike, with relatively paltry wage increments in the out years. Most of the teaching assistants – who have made Cola, a guaranteed cost of living adjustment each year, a key demand – see such a long-duration contract as a recipe for more inflationary wage erosion.

For the moment, all UAW members at UC remain on strike, but some union leaders seem inclined to encourage ratification of contracts covering the postdoctoral scholars and academic researchers, leaving the graduate student TAs to fend for themselves. This would be a disaster, generating recrimination, division and disaffection within the ranks of the more active grad student strikers.

There is still time to avoid such a debacle and instead carry the strike to victory. UC administrators plead that budget constraints foreclose the possibility of any large wage boost for the school’s 36,000 graduate student workers. Yet California remains an immensely wealthy state, with a budget surplus that almost reached $100bn this year. Over the last several decades, however, state funding for UC, as well as the even larger state university system, has steadily declined. Today just over 10% of UC’s $44bn budget is funded by California itself, down from more than half when in 1963 UC president Clark Kerr famously declared that the institution he led was a “multiversity”, the world-class model for the creation of a knowledge-based society.

The UC strike is therefore not just an effort to raise thousands of academic workers out of near poverty, but a movement whose success will require a reversal of the austerity that has subverted the higher education promise in California and elsewhere. That is a cause that deserves our hearty endorsement.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/05/california-academic-strike-most-important-us-higher-education-history,2022-12-05T00:00:00
137,Georgia Senate voters have a moral choice. White Christians are choosing hypocrisy | Steve Phillips,"Why do we have such low expectations for white voters? The midterm elections brought into stark relief just how many white voters are willing to make a mockery of showing any pretense of concern for democracy, good governance or even the barest qualifications for our country’s highest offices. As unfortunate as that behavior is, what’s even more dangerous for the future of the country is how resigned the rest of the country has become to the anti-democratic and intellectually unjustifiable voting patterns of much of white America.

On one level, we shouldn’t be surprised because white Americans have been voting against whatever political party is aligned with Black people for more than a century – the civil war itself began when seven slaveholding states, all dominated by the Democratic party, refused to accept the outcome of the 1860 election, seceded from the Union and launched a violent and bloody war. While many would like to believe that such whites-first electoral decision-making is a thing of the past, the most recent midterm elections reveal just how little progress has been made.

The slew of inexperienced and unqualified candidates elevated by Donald Trump this year was markedly different from prior elections over the past several decades. In Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia and other states, Republicans put forward as nominees for the US Senate people who’d never held any elected office or expressed much interest in participating in government at all. And yet, in state after state, the majority of white voters opted to back the candidate with no demonstrable qualification for the office other than that they were endorsed by the former president, who sought and seeks to make America white again.

The situation is most stark in Georgia, which has its Senate runoff election on 6 December. After the African American civil rights leader and minister Raphael Warnock was elected to the US Senate from Georgia in 2021, Trump recruited the former Georgia football player Herschel Walker – who lived and may still live in Texas – and persuaded him to throw his hat in Georgia’s 2022 Senate race. Beyond Walker’s blatant lack of qualifications – or for that matter even interest – in government, his candidacy has been repeatedly rocked by scandal. From alleged domestic violence and stalking (including allegedly holding a gun to his ex-wife’s head) to reportedly fathering at least four children he has not publicly acknowledged (while opining in the media about the ills of absentee fathers) to the rank hypocrisy of championing anti-abortion views while having allegedly paid for two abortions of women he impregnated, the scale of Walker’s previously disqualifying revelations is at a truly Trumpian level.

The pretense that Georgia’s white voters were conducting a good-faith exercise in democracy is laid bare by looking at the behavior of those who self-describe as “white born-again or evangelical Christians”. Georgia’s white Christians faced – and still face – a choice between a man who has zero qualifications for the office and a mountain of unchristian immorality and scandal on the one hand, and an incumbent senator who is a Christian minister and the successor to Martin Luther King Jr. (Warnock is the senior pastor at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, the faith-based home of Dr King.)

Walker’s melanin notwithstanding, he is nonetheless the handpicked errand boy of Trump and all who subscribe to his whites-first view of the world. As Georgia pastor Jamal Bryant put it, “When the Republican party of Georgia moved Herschel Walker from Texas to Georgia so that he could run for Senate, it was because change was taking too fast in the post-antebellum South, and there were some … who were not prepared for a Black man and a Jewish man to go to the Senate at the exact same time.”

In deciding between the Christian church leader and the unrepentant and unqualified hypocrite, 88% of white born-again Christians voters chose against the church leader. Which leads to the inescapable conclusion that it was not the Christian part of their identity that determined their political choice. It was their whiteness.

Despite the absolute absurdity of this situation, the rest of the country has collectively shrugged its shoulders and moved on without any expressions of outrage or attempts to insist on some shred of fidelity to the notion that we’re supposed to be choosing responsible leaders to serve in our highest governing body. Where are the articles and stories interviewing Georgia’s white Christians about why they are voting for the decidedly unchristian Walker over the Christian pastor Warnock? Where are the calls, tweets and emails to reporters demanding that they ask such questions?

The national silence brings to mind the words of Georgia native Dr King in his famous Letter from a Birmingham Jail: “We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people.”

Beyond the morality of the matter is a question of practical politics. We now know that ignoring white racial preference in elections is ineffective. Letting white people off the hook doesn’t work; what does work is holding the line, insisting on standards and challenging whites to rise above the race-based pandering they are offered by modern-day Republicans.

When Barack Obama’s opponents attempted to weaken his support among whites by endless and out-of-context repetition of seemingly controversial comments by his then pastor, Jeremiah Wright, he tackled the challenge head-on with his now-famous “race speech”: “In the white community,” Obama said, “the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that … the legacy of discrimination – and current incidents of discrimination, while less overt than in the past – are real and must be addressed, not just with words, but with deeds.”

Fears were calmed, and Obama went on to secure the highest percentage of the white vote of any Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976.

Academic research has also affirmed the effectiveness of this approach. In her book The Race Card, Princeton professor Tali Mendelberg revealed how Republicans’ use of coded racial messages, and their impact on voters, lost power when the implicit was made explicit. She found that “when campaign discourse is clearly about race – when it is explicitly racial – it has the fewest racial consequences for white opinion”.

Trump and his electoral success broke many norms of America’s fragile democracy, and we are still trying to pick up the pieces. One norm we should not and must not relinquish is outrage at obvious and unapologetic racist behavior in the electorate. It is imperative that we hold voters to a higher standard.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/06/georgia-senate-vote-white-christians-walker-warnock,2022-12-06T00:00:00
138,Pegasus spyware was used to hack reporters’ phones. I’m suing its creators | Nelson Rauda Zablah,"I was warned in August 2020. A source told me to meet him at six o’clock at night in an empty parking lot in San Salvador. He had my number, but he contacted me through a mutual acquaintance instead; he didn’t want to leave a trace. When I arrived, he told me to leave my phone in the car. As we walked, he warned me that my colleagues at El Faro, the Salvadoran news organization, were being followed because of a story they were pursuing about negotiations between the president of El Salvador and the notorious MS-13 gang.

This may read like an eerie movie scene, but there are many Central American journalists who have lived it for real. The suspicion you’re being followed, ditching your phone before meetings, using encrypted messaging and email apps, speaking in code, never publishing your live location – these are ordinary routines for many in my profession.

I wouldn’t know until more than a year later what my source really meant. My colleagues weren’t just being trailed as they investigated that story. They, and at least 18 other members of El Faro – including me – had been the repeated targets of a weapons-grade espionage software called Pegasus. Pegasus is the gleaming toy of the Israel-based spyware firm NSO Group. Forensic analysis by the Citizen Lab and others found that Pegasus attacks in El Salvador started in June 2020 and continued until November 2021. In all, 35 journalists and members of civil society were spied on with this tool.

When you’re infected by Pegasus, spies effectively hold a clone of your phone. They can see everything, from your personal pictures and texts to your purchases and your selection and use of apps. When the spying was discovered I had to take measures that included exiting my family group chat and deleting my banking apps.

For journalists, this means spies can see every chat and phone call with our sources. I was hacked while I pursued and published private videos of two brothers of President Nayib Bukele negotiating over El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law with foreign businessmen before it came into effect. My colleagues Gabriela Cáceres and Carlos Martínez were hacked as they continued to reveal more details about the government’s dealing with gangs and a thwarted criminal investigation about it. I could go on and on.

Journalism has become even harder after the attacks. When news of the hacking broke, a few sources jokingly answered our calls by greeting the good people who might be listening. But many more picked up the phone only to say we should stop calling them, and most simply didn’t respond at all. In one instance, a source told me that he now understood why his wife had been fired from her government position. I felt horrible. Guilty. Powerless.

That’s how Pegasus makes you feel above all: powerless. We believe the infections in El Faro happened through a “zero-click exploit”, meaning we didn’t even click on a phony link to open a door for the spies. They just broke in. Change your number, get a new device – they’ll just break in there, too.

And yet we refused to be powerless. We told our story to news outlets all over the world. In El Salvador, we held press conferences, went on TV and filed a case before the attorney general’s office. None of this brought any kind of accountability for the illegal spying. So, represented by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, 14 of my colleagues at El Faro and I have decided to sue NSO Group.

I can assure you we’re not in this for the money: if we wanted to be rich, we wouldn’t be independent journalists. We’re doing this as a progression of our everyday work in El Salvador to expose official wrongdoing. We’re doing this in the United States because we’ve exhausted all legal avenues in El Salvador’s co-opted institutions.

And we’re doing this not just for us. In April, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz assembled a list of more than 450 law-abiding men and women around the world whose devices had been hacked by NSO Group’s Pegasus. Many of them are not in countries or positions where they can sue.

But someone has to. NSO executives shouldn’t be able to wash their hands as their tools are used to persecute journalists. In a very real sense, NSO set the hounds on us. And now we’re fighting back.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/05/pegasus-spyware-journalists-phone-hacking-lawsuit,2022-12-05T00:00:00
139,I have a relaxed attitude to swearing. Should I care if my children use swear words? | Isabelle Oderberg,"“Should I care if my children use swear words?”

My three-year-old is a genius. Just the other day, she created her first portmanteau. You can imagine our pride, her parents, both writers, when she called her brother a “basthole”, giggling as she created a word more powerful than its constituent contributors; arsehole and bastard.

It wasn’t until I was pregnant that my husband and I had our first conversation about swearing and kids. I asked, with great trepidation, whether we were going to attempt to stop swearing in front of the kids. He laughed, assuring me that it was an absolute impossibility – that I, in particular, would not be able to stop in any scenario. In fact, there is a large pillow in my living room that says, “I tried to stop swearing but I cunt”, bought for me by my mother.

Ultimately there were two primary contributors to my laissez-faire attitude to “foul” language. The first was my very liberal (small L) parents (when it came to swearing and a host of other things) and the other was working in newsrooms from the age of 16. They might now be slightly more genteel than when I started, but early on in my career, you weren’t really part of the gang unless you could down 15 beers in a night, chain-smoke without skipping a beat and swear more colourfully than a Ken Done painting. Especially in the business round.

These two influences definitely combined to give me the potty mouth I have now and my realisation that stopping would be nigh on impossible. Where I was in situations where I couldn’t openly swear, I fell back on the Cantonese swear words I heard growing up in Hong Kong that allowed me to adequately acquit frustration (“diu lei” and “chi sin” among them). Ultimately, I decided that with my children, I would deploy the tactic my own mother took with me.

“We have inside-the-house words and out-of-the-house words,” she said, trying to keep a straight face.

There are two reasons reason I recycled this strategy, handed down through the generations, rather than banning swearing outright. The first is the irrefutable, scientifically proved fact that a little kid swearing is uproariously hilarious. Possibly because it’s so rare that we hear one of those tiny little baby pouts wrapped around words like “fuck” or “bugger”.

The second is to protect my kids, because I’m well aware that not everyone is as relaxed with language as me.

But come on guys, swearing is something kids can’t avoid. It’s on TV. It’s in the street. It’s at school. It’s on signage. It’s on half of my t-shirts. It’s everywhere. Moreover, there are things that concern me far more than swearing.

Violence. Guns. Drugs. Tattoos (yes I am a dirty, rotten hypocrite, given I’m covered in them).

Swearing is just words. With the exception of words used to demean or bully people on the basis of ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or any other aspect of their identity or gender – which are explicitly banned in our family with a full and detailed explanation as to why – these are just words. Muttering the word “shit” when I drop something on my toe is not going to signal the end the world. There are a raft of things that are far more damaging to my babies.

So if that’s my view, why do I care? Why do I restrict swearing to the house or the car? Only because others – namely other parents and perhaps teachers – don’t have the same relaxed attitude to swearing as I do. Maybe they have yet to catch up. Maybe they view it differently. Maybe they see it as an issue of respect.

But what would they know? Bastholes.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/06/i-have-a-relaxed-attitude-to-swearing-should-i-care-if-my-children-use-swear-words,2022-12-06T00:00:00
140,"Aaron Judge reportedly signs $360m, nine-year contract with New York Yankees","Aaron Judge is staying with the New York Yankees on a $360m, nine-year contract, according to a person familiar with the deal.

The source confirmed the deal to the Associated Press and Judge’s new contract was reported by multiple other outlets, including ESPN and MLB Network.

Judge will earn $40m per season, the highest average annual payout for a position player. The contract trails only Mike Trout’s $426.5m deal with the Los Angeles Angels and Mookie Betts’ $365m pact with the Los Angeles Dodgers for biggest in baseball history. The latter two players’ contracts are for 12 years, meaning they earn less per year than Judge.

Judge was offered a long-term deal by New York before last season that was worth $213.5m over seven years from 2023-29. But he turned it down in the hours before opening day in April.

The 6ft 7in Judge bet on himself and won. He set an American League record with 62 homers in 2022, powering the Yankees to the AL East title. He also tied for the major league lead with 131 RBIs and just missed a Triple Crown with a .311 batting average. New York were swept by Houston in the AL Championship Series, but Judge became the first AL MVP for the Yankees since Alex Rodriguez in 2007.

By rejecting the Yankees’ preseason offer, the 30-year-old gained $146.5m and an extra two guaranteed seasons. The northern California native also visited with the San Francisco Giants last month, and there were most likely more teams monitoring the market for the slugger.

Judge’s decision will have a domino effect on several teams and free agents. His status held up at least some of New York’s offseason plans, but general manager Brian Cashman made it clear his team would wait patiently to see what Judge wanted to do.

In the end, the patient approach worked.

Judge was selected by New York in the first round of the 2013 amateur draft and made his big league debut in 2016, homering in his first at-bat. A year later, he was one of baseball’s breakout stars. He hit .284 with 52 homers and 114 RBIs in 2017, winning the AL Rookie of the Year award. The four-time All-Star has 220 homers and 497 RBIs in seven big league seasons.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/07/aaron-judge-reportedly-signs-360m-nine-year-contract-with-new-york-yankees,2022-12-07T00:00:00
141,Struggling Rams claim former No 1 overall pick Baker Mayfield off waivers,"The Los Angeles Rams claimed quarterback Baker Mayfield off waivers on Tuesday, adding the former No 1 pick to their options behind injured Matthew Stafford for the rest of the season.

Mayfield, the 2017 Heisman Trophy winner and former Cleveland Browns starter, was released by the Panthers on Monday at his request after seven disappointing games with Carolina.

The struggling Rams host the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday night, and it’s unclear whether Mayfield could be ready to participate for a team already down to backup quarterbacks John Wolford, who has been battling a neck injury and other ailments, and Bryce Perkins.

“My gosh, you’d probably know as much as I would on that right now,” Rams offensive coordinator Liam Coen told reporters when asked if Mayfield might play Thursday. “I couldn’t tell you. I haven’t spoken to him. I’ve only heard great things about him, his professional nature in Carolina and some of the things that went on there.”

Rams head coach Sean McVay wasn’t scheduled to speak to reporters on Tuesday after he acquired a quarterback whose talents greatly intrigued him coming out of college at Oklahoma, but both of his coordinators praised the acquisition.

“I’ve got a lot of respect for him,” Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris said. “This guy was a very good football player. Brought Cleveland from pretty much the ashes. This game is sometimes thankless. We get a chance to acquire guys who’ve got nothing to lose and something to prove is always awesome.”

After league-wide speculation about Mayfield joining the contending San Francisco 49ers or Baltimore Ravens, Mayfield instead will attempt to help the injury-plagued Rams (3-9). Los Angeles have lost six straight games during what’s shaping up as the worst season in NFL history for a defending Super Bowl champion.

The Rams have almost no reason to tank the remaining season because their first-round pick belongs to Detroit, and they need help at quarterback. Stafford is almost certainly out for the season with a bruised spinal cord, and Wolford and Perkins have been fairly ineffective while combining to start three of the past four games, all losses. Wolford passed for 178 yards with no touchdowns in last Sunday’s loss to Seattle.

But it’s unclear how much help Mayfield can provide: He had a dismal season with the Panthers, who acquired him for a fifth-round pick in July after the Browns’ acquisition of Deshaun Watson ended his up-and-down tenure in Cleveland, where he was a four-year starter and engineered the end of the franchise’s 18-year playoff drought in 2020.

Mayfield won the first-string job in training camp with Carolina, but went 1-5 as a starter while throwing six touchdown passes and six interceptions. He was outplayed in recent weeks by both Sam Darnold and PJ Walker.

McVay frequently received credit for Kirk Cousins’ development into a solid NFL starter during McVay’s time as Washington’s offensive coordinator. As a head coach, McVay led the Rams to four winning seasons, three playoff berths and a Super Bowl appearance with Jared Goff at the controls. McVay then became the youngest coach in NFL history to win a Super Bowl title last season after trading Goff for Stafford, who had one of the most impressive seasons of his lengthy career.

Whether this latest partnership lasts only five games or goes longer, McVay will have the opportunity to decide whether Mayfield can still be the quarterback McVay thought he would be coming out of Oklahoma.

“It’s a chance to evaluate,” Coen said. “You’re always looking for competition at every position, and you’re looking for a chance to evaluate talent. That was the goal. ... We feel good about our room and the quarterback that we have for the future of the Los Angeles Rams, which is Matthew Stafford, but we feel obviously pretty good about somebody to come in here and compete at a high level for us.”

The 34-year-old Stafford is under contract through the 2026 season, but his injuries and two trips through the concussion protocol – even though the Rams haven’t confirmed he ever had a concussion this season – have sparked widespread speculation about how long he plans to continue his career.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/06/los-angeles-rams-baker-mayfield-waivers-nfl-football,2022-12-06T00:00:00
142,"Mills Lane, referee of Holyfield-Tyson ‘bite fight’, dies at age of 85","Mills Lane, the referee who disqualified Mike Tyson for biting Evander Holyfield’s ears in the 1997 world heavyweight title fight, has died at the age of 85.

Lane’s son, Tommy, told the Reno Gazette-Journal that his father, who had been in poor health since suffering a stroke 20 years ago, died peacefully at a hospice in the Nevada city on Tuesday.

“He took a significant decline in his overall situation,” Tommy Lane told the Gazette-Journal. “It was a quick departure. He was comfortable and he was surrounded by his family.”

Lane served in the US Marines for three years before attending college. He boxed in the Marines and at college where he turned professional, winning his first 10 fights before retiring with a 10-1 record. He then turned to law and had a successful career as a prosecutor, and later found fame as a TV courtroom judge. He eventually became a boxing referee and coined his memorable catchphrase, “Let’s get it on”.

Lane officiated in a number of other controversial heavyweight fights, including the second meeting between Holyfield and Riddick Bowe in 1993, which was interrupted by a paraglider landing in the ring.

He threw out a distressed Oliver McCall from his 1997 rematch with Lennox Lewis, and also disqualified Henry Akinwande for excessive holding against Lewis four months later.

“[Lane] was one of the most unique people I’ve ever met,” Marc Ratner, the former executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, told Yahoo Sports. “He was a law-and-order guy and very firm, but he was a wonderful guy and I loved speaking with him and spending time with him. He was a no-nonsense referee and even though he was a slight man, when he gave commands and told the fighters to break, they broke because they had so much respect for him.”

Lane was elected into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2013. He is survived by his wife Kaye and sons Terry and Tommy.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/06/mills-lane-referee-of-holyfield-tyson-bite-fight-dies-at-age-of-85,2022-12-06T00:00:00
143,Deion Sanders’ Rocky Mountain high is a low for Black colleges,"Say this much for Deion Sanders: He didn’t slink away under cover of darkness, quiet quit on the season or reach for another dog-eared page from the opportunist’s playbook.

Instead, the 55-year-old coach gathered up his Jackson State Tigers players one last time over the weekend and told them that, indeed, the breaking news was true – that the University of Colorado had hired him away. “It’s not about a bag,” he told the somber room. “I’ve been making money a long time and ain’t nowhere near broke. It is about an opportunity.”

As good ol’ fashion Mississippi scandals go, only the case swirling around Brett Favre tops this. Coach Prime, as he redubbed himself, is a singular phenomenon in sports, the great athlete who is also a great coach. He talks a good game too – rhyming like a preacher, turning podiums into pulpits, framing his coaching odyssey as a divine calling. “Usually, a coach is elevated or terminated,” he said of his new position in Colorado. If he sounds like a cleric, that’s because it’s one of many positions Sanders has occupied in his dizzyingly peripatetic career.

When Sanders arrived at Jackson in the fall of 2020, he didn’t just vow to turn around a program that had been a loser for much of the past decade. He said he’d flip the field for historically black colleges and universities to make “HBCUs” like Jackson State as attractive as predominantly white institutions like Colorado. And he was promising the moon at a time when the social justice movement had turned HBCUs into a cause for reparations.

And once again Sanders walked the talk, losing just five games out of 32, setting scoring records and selling out stadiums all the while. He lured away top recruits (starting with his quarterback son, Shedeur), prompted fellow NFL alums Eddie George and Hue Jackson to join him in the HBCU coaching ranks. He had ESPN covering the Tigers with intensity that’s typically reserved for the Dallas Cowboys or the Alabama Crimson Tide.

Sanders was right about the spotlight’s knack for finding him. It didn’t matter if he was peddling insurance in TV adverts with Bama’s Nick Saban, or getting stiff-armed out of a post game shug; little of what Sanders did at Jackson State went unnoticed. That he was also so generous about sharing his attention with the young Black men and women at Jackson State only further set him apart in a profession known for harboring white men with big egos and retrograde social values (ahem).

With the Colorado hire, Sanders becomes the 12th Black coach in college football’s top tier – and at a time when stalwarts like Florida Atlantic’s Willie Taggart and Stanford’s David Shaw are cycling out of their roles. It would be a shining moment for equity and fairness if it weren’t also such a dark day for HBCU football. Even though he ended his Jackson State tenure on a high note, winning a second straight conference championship last Saturday, the prevailing mood was downcast. “I think many Jackson State fans were holding out hope that the news wasn’t true, or he wouldn’t go through with it,” Tiffany Greene, who called Saturday’s game for ESPN, told me.

Sanders’ impact went far beyond Jackson State in his three years there, after all. He boosted the local economy and awareness of Jackson’s colleges and high schools. He shone a light on Jackson’s water crisis, which forced a shutdown of schools, colleges and businesses. Earlier this fall Sanders’ team survived on bottled water donations and lived in a hotel because of the water crisis; the cost, $15,000 a night, isn’t money Jackson State keeps lying around. “How can we go out there, dominate like that, and take a child back to something that is shut down and you have no water?” he said after the Tigers season opener. “You can’t even flush the darn toilet. You have to think about that stuff.”

Not only did Sanders appear to be invested in reviving HBCUs’ reputation for grooming pro talent like Walter Payton (Jackson State), Jerry Rice (Mississippi Valley State) and Shannon Sharpe (Savannah State), Coach Prime was fully engaged in the bigger, much trickier job of creating self-sustaining Black communities. That he had come so far in such a short period only heightened expectations. That there was still so much work to do didn’t matter because Sanders, reputation aside, kept cracking on. It didn’t seem long before the day would come when he cut the ribbon at a new stadium and punctuate the moment with news of a blockbuster HBCU television rights pact, or a similar tide that lifts all ships.

By staying at Jackson State, Sanders could have become even bigger than he ever was as a two-sport, twin Super Bowl-winning, double football hall of famer. Given that, as he says, he’s not hurting for money, he didn’t have to operate like some coach who paid his dues sleeping at the office while barely making minimum wage. Sanders could have been Jackson State’s version of Eddie G Robinson, the trailblazer who launched tiny Grambling State into a pigskin power – a coaching immortal. But now that Coach Prime is gone, well, much of that hope is too.

Nothing against Colorado. It’s a mint of a program, the Power Five equivalent of a double-digit miles Lamborghini. Before a decade-long swoon the Buffaloes ranked among college football’s elite, laying claim to the 1990 national championship and the 1994 Heisman trophy winner before an odious culture of alcohol and sex abuse toppled them. With Shedeur Sanders leading the parade of transfer students Coach Prime brings with him, there’s little reason to believe that the Buffaloes couldn’t dominate a listless Pac 12 conference and emerge as national title contenders soon.

The chance to compete at college football’s highest level wasn’t all that attracted Sanders. There was also the pay bump (to a reported $4.5m from $300,000, not that he needs the money – assuming Colorado can actually pay him) and the Buffaloes’ first-rate facilities. In his introductory news conference, Sanders praised Boulder as a “crime-free city.” For a Jackson State community currently grappling with a recent campus homicide case, the throwaway line must have stung.

Jackson State, though a notch below Colorado in the NCAA’s Football Championship Subdivision, was hardly a cakewalk for Coach Prime. He took the reins during Covid, has only recently recovered from having two toes amputated, and spent a chunk of this year working out of a hotel during the Jackson water crisis. His tenure kicked off with burglars ransacking his office. If those aren’t justifiable reasons to move on, consider the massive stage he just secured for his son – who is rounding into a top NFL draft prospect.

Sanders is clearly hurt by perceptions that he sold out his people by not just going west, but to city that’s 0.9% Black. “The thing that alarms me the most is just because I’m leaving Jackson, they think that I’m leaving African Americans,” Sanders thundered. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed or not, but I’m Black. I can never leave who I am, what I am, how I am or how I go about being that.”

Still: Without Jackson State taking him in and washing the stains of his checkered high school coaching career (once a resume sticking point), Sanders never reaches this Rocky Mountain high. But worse than seeing him take his man of the cleats act to another campus – but not before returning to lead Jackson State in the Celebration Bowl – is the realization that he is who he’s always been: a hired gun. He might not borrow from the opportunist’s playbook, but the game he’s playing at is no different.",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/06/deion-sanders-jackson-state-colorado-hbcus-college-football,2022-12-06T00:00:00
144,The biodiversity crisis in numbers - a visual guide,"Despite humanity’s many technological advances, we can only manage a well-informed guess at the true extent of life on Earth: 8.7 million species, according to the most commonly cited figure, with other estimates ranging between 5.3 million and one trillion.

There is greater certainty about the decline of biodiversity that human behaviour is driving, with species dying off as much as 1,000 times more frequently than before the arrival of humans 60m years ago, as one study suggests.

“Humanity will eventually pay a very high price for the decimation of the only assemblage of life that we know of in the universe,” scientists Gerardo Ceballos, Paul R Ehrlich and Rodolfo Dirzo wrote in a 2017 paper, warning of a sixth mass extinction of life on Earth.

Changes in land and sea use, exploitation of natural resources, global heating, pollution and the spread of invasive species are the five main drivers of this loss of life, according to leading UN experts.

One of the best sources about the decline of biodiversity is the Living Planet Index, a metric developed by researchers at the WWF and the Zoological Society of London to measure the abundance of animal life. It is made up of datasets from about 32,000 populations of 5,230 animal species. When populations of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles increase, so does the index. The opposite happens when populations decline.

According to the most recent figures, wildlife populations have plunged by an average of 69% between 1970 and 2018. The abundance of mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles is falling fast, as populations of sea lions, sharks, frogs and salmon collapse.

The declines have been particularly calamitous in Latin America and the Caribbean, which has seen a 94% drop in the average wildlife population size. Africa has had the second largest fall at 66%, followed by Asia and the Pacific with 55% and North America at 20%. Europe and Central Asia experienced an 18% fall.

These declines do not mean that nearly 70% of animals have been wiped out in just 48 years. It means populations have dramatically fallen and extinction risk is growing, although it is not distributed equally.

According to the IUCN Red List, a key source on the state of the world’s biodiversity, about 2.13 million species have been identified by scientists; around half of these species are insects. Just 6,577 are mammals, 369,000 are flowering plants and four are horseshoe crabs.

Scientists have conducted analysis of more than 147,500 species for the IUCN Red List, finding that more than 41,000 are threatened with extinction. Cycads – ancient seed-bearing plants that pre-date the dinosaurs – are the group most threatened, with more than 80% at risk of disappearing altogether. More than 40% of sharks and rays are at risk of extinction, while more than a fifth of birds could go.

The human domination of the planet has also meant that livestock and humans far outweigh wild animals. In terms of biomass, plants are the most abundant, comprising 82% of the total, according to a 2018 estimate. Of mammals, which make up a tiny portion of the overall figure, livestock comprise 60%, humans 36% and wild animals just 4%.

The risks of biodiversity loss are not spread equally. Tropical rainforests and coral reefs are home to more life than deserts and polar mountain regions. Danger is also uneven: the risk of agricultural expansion is low in the Siberian tundra compared with the edge of the Congo basin rainforest, for example.

Researchers have identified 36 biodiversity hotspots – areas of Earth that are rich in life but threatened by human behaviour – that require the most urgent protection. They include the Sundaland, the Caucasus, Wallacea and the forests of eastern Australia.

The decline of Earth’s biodiversity is not inevitable. Several studies show that the continued loss of wildlife around the world can be prevented. The Iberian lynx, Przewalski’s horse and the Puerto Rican amazon parrot are among 48 species already saved from extinction by conservationists.

A new metric, known as the IUCN green status, is helping scientists plot a path to recovery for threatened animals and plants for their potential range and abundance. The California condor, for example, although at risk of extinction is believed to have significant potential to rebound. Many more can be restored.

145,Bin so long: Adelaide woman puts rubbish out for first time in two years after epic effort to cut waste,"An Adelaide woman has taken her rubbish bin out for the first time in two years, having taken concerted steps to reduce the amount of waste her household generates.

Alice Clanachan’s bin left her yard for the first time in 26 months on Tuesday – still with a little room at the top.

“I could have gone a bit longer, but it’s getting hot,” she said.

The “reduce, reuse, recycle” philosophy has been part of her life for more than a decade, but it has only been since the pandemic that Clanachan seriously committed to avoiding the creation of waste in any form.

“It’s been a long time and a long journey,” she said.

“I think about all the share-houses I lived in and flatmates I had … this cohort of people who said ‘you taught me how to do this, you were so strict’.

“Now I try not to accumulate anything.”

The small bin of waste, representing two years in Clanachan’s life, mostly contained tradie rubbish – repairs from old pipes or drains.

Apart from that, there were some worn-out gardening gloves, rapid antigen tests, thermal paper receipts, vacuum cleaner dust, dental floss and broken ceramics.

Clanachan does not drive a car and uses her bicycle and public transport, making it harder for big weekly supermarket shops. She buys the majority of her produce from farmers markets and in bulk – bringing her own containers for grains and rice.

“I avoid pre-packaged foods, and save egg cartons for people with chickens,” she said. “The 2kg yogurt carton I buy I give to a friend who grows mushrooms.

“I feel I fail a bit when I put the recycling bin out. I would prefer them to have other lives and uses before they go to landfill.”

According to Planet Ark, around 2.44m tonnes of the 4.9m tonnes of materials sent to landfill each year are either recyclable or compostable.

Up to 18% of the material in council-provided waste bins is recyclable, while just over half could be composted at home or organic processing facilities.

Fellow Adelaide resident Trudy Conroy thought she had broken a record after avoiding putting out her landfill bin for 78 weeks.

Now that Clanachan has pipped her title, she is determined to make her bin last for 100 this time.

“I only really got into it in the last two to three years,” she said. “I bought a compost bin … it went on for a while and then I thought, ‘I wonder if I can get to a year?’.

“I got to a year and thought, ‘how much longer can I go?’ You start getting quite stubborn.”

She is sure she would have made it another month if not for an old pillow that nobody wanted on pay it forward groups.

“It felt a bit weird putting it out, it had spiderwebs and duct tape on it,” she said. “But I’ve learned a lot about what can be recycled.”

Adelaide residents have shown it’s possible to keep landfill to a minimum over an extended period.

The City of Adelaide provides residents with a kitchen caddy and compostable liner bags for organic items like egg shells, food scraps, clippings and coffee grounds. The green organics are turned into mulch and compost for local gardens.

Reuse and recycle hubs also allow e-waste including bread tags, batteries and light globes to be diverted from landfill and recycled or repurposed.

Conroy has a box on her front veranda collecting waste that can be passed on to processing facilities – from bubble wrap to toothbrush tubes.

“I go for long walks where I pass the dump,” she said. “Some of the stuff I see through the fence … so much doesn’t need to be in landfill and it upsets me.

“Once you start looking you think, ‘I’ve been throwing those things out for years’. I make the red bin my last resort.”

As for Clanachan’s advice?

“Whatever your living situation, there are ways to compost and reduce,” she said. “Ditch the supermarkets and find your local grocer. You can buy less packaging, but also have conversations with those you’re buying from and that’s very powerful.”",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/06/bin-so-long-adelaide-woman-puts-rubbish-out-for-first-time-in-two-years-after-epic-effort-to-cut-waste,2022-12-06T00:00:00
146,Kirstie Alley was celebrated not because she was flawless – but because her flaws were so visible,"It was an impressively shocking moment in the hit sitcom Cheers when actor Kirstie Alley opened her mouth to reveal her tongue gripping a lit cigarette – in one short, catlike movement, she expertly flipped it over, caught it between her teeth and sunk in to a satisfied puff of smoke. In the scene, Alley is wearing a pink turtleneck beneath a pink coat sporting big, 80s shoulders, the whole moment conjuring the feeling of the alpha bad girl taking a surreptitious smoke break in the ladies’ room.

That moment sums up a lot about the unique personality that Alley brought to Cheers and the decades of acting and celebrity that would follow as she hewed out a persona that was compelling in its complexity.

Although by the time Alley arrived at Cheers in 1987 she had already developed a reputation with roles in the films Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Runaway, it was in the hit Boston sitcom that Alley reached stardom, winning an Emmy for her portrayal of neurotic businesswoman Rebecca Howe. She boldly stepped into the absence made by the departure of lead actress Shelley Long, establishing herself as a force in her own right and giving the show a new lease on life.

Alley’s Howe emanated a roughness and wildness beneath the surface of a highly polished, if undeniably maladjusted femininity – in that, it very much resembled Alley’s infamous Emmys speech, where she offered a disjointed, bawdy series of remarks that felt as sincere and joyful as they did boundary-pushing and inappropriate.

As her career grew, Alley moved beyond Cheers to star in popular movies like the Look Who’s Talking trilogy, as well as becoming the lead character in the the sitcom Veronica’s Closet, where she played the owner of a company selling racy lingerie and other things to be enjoyed in the bedroom. Projects such as these continued building her trajectory as an actor willing to push her sex appeal into edgy territory, while also letting her shine as an anxiety-ridden everywoman who just wants to find a good man and fall in love.

Much as with the fictional characters she depicted, in her personal life Alley very publicly went her own way. She credited her affiliation with the Church of Scientology for helping her overcome a serious cocaine addiction, and in the church she ultimately reached the status of Operating Thetan Level 8, an extremely high rank costing millions of dollars to obtain. She also courted controversy in her affiliation with candidate Donald Trump, pledging then retracting her support for him in the 2016 presidential election, ultimately declaring in October 2020 that she had voted for him once and planned to do so again. Amid all the scrutiny of her Trump ties, it was less remembered that Alley also voted for Barack Obama twice.

Alley had a similarly on-again, off-again relationship with the weight loss company Jenny Craig, first operating as a spokesperson, then departing from the company and starting her own weight-loss enterprise, Organic Liaison, then eventually selling that company to Jenny Craig and resuming spokesperson duties. Just as her relationship with Jenny Craig went back and forth, so did her weight: on Oprah in 2005, she very publicly castigated herself for weighing too much, then returned to that show a year later modelling a bikini, her weight continuing to very publicly yo-yo for a decade afterwards.

Along the way Alley turned her calorie angst into a mordant, unscripted, semi-autobiographical Showtime series called Fat Actress, a very prototypical move for her. Alley’s shoot-from-the-hip stance and high-profile battles with her demons were things that resonated with fans, as was her reputation for having a big heart and not putting on airs. While Alley’s support for Trump or her many incendiary, expletive-laden tweets were often divisive (Alley claimed that her Trump votes got her blackballed by Hollywood), it’s telling that Jenny Craig never pulled her back as a spokesperson and that her death occasioned an outpouring of fond remembrances, even from those she had feuded with.

Alley was so widely celebrated not because she was flawless but because her flaws were so visible – she was among those celebrities who are compelling because they eschew the carefully managed image of the famous in favour of offering something that feels completely unfiltered and thus far more intimate.

It was this sense of unscripted intimacy that she brought to her best roles and that defined her as an actor, letting her inhabit her characters with a forcefulness bordering on swagger. Alley achieved prominence at a time when actors like Roseanne Barr and Rosie O’Donnell courted controversy in large part by defying sexist expectations of how a female celebrity should come off in public life, and how she should portray characters in film and TV.

If some of Alley’s stances now feel retrograde or even cringe-inducing, they are reflective of the degree to which the forces that forged her as an actor swallowed her up. Right till the end, Alley presented a picture of an individual actively working to heal herself amid a painful, difficult search for peace.",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/07/kirstie-alley-was-celebrated-not-because-she-was-flawless-but-because-her-flaws-were-so-visible,2022-12-07T00:00:00
147,Kirstie Alley obituary,"Five years into the hit sitcom Cheers, set in a homely neighbourhood bar in Boston, its female lead Shelley Long, who played the prim waitress Diane, quit the series. This left Sam (Ted Danson), the self-obsessed bar-owner, no one to spar with, and risked depriving the show of its screwball-style sexual tension.

Kirstie Alley, who has died of cancer aged 71, beat Sharon Stone and Kim Cattrall to the role of Long’s replacement, joining the show in 1987. As the bar’s apparently tough new manager, Rebecca, she went toe-to-toe with Danson right from her audition scene. “She had an incredibly sexy voice that was perfect to drive Ted bananas,” said James Burrows, the show’s director and co-creator. “In the test scene, there was a line where she says she’s not attracted to Sam. With Kirstie, you believed it.”

Rebecca takes Sam back into the business as an employee after his ambition to sail the world runs aground. Instantly the power balance is altered in fruitful and fascinating ways, with Sam’s status reduced and his credentials as a Casanova more robustly tested.

The original idea, said the show’s co-creator Les Charles, had been to position Rebecca as “the dragon lady, Cruella de Vil”. One of the first comments made about her on screen is that she “eats live sharks for breakfast”. Then Charles’s brother Glen, also a co-creator on Cheers, noticed Alley chain-smoking on set. “She was obviously nervous and who wouldn’t be, following Shelley? I thought we could probably use that, break down this cool, sophisticated facade she presents.”

One of the show’s writers, Cheri Steinkellner, admitted that “it took a while for us to figure out where the fun was with her”. A scene in which Alley was called upon to sob made it suddenly plain. “She started crying like nobody since Lucy Ricardo [Lucille Ball’s character in I Love Lucy]. That was the day we got our handle on Rebecca. We figured out she was not just another loser; she was the biggest, saddest loser in the bar.”

Alley played Rebecca in 148 episodes, winning an Emmy and a Golden Globe in 1991, and was the only surviving member of the Cheers cast not to appear even briefly in the spin-off series Frasier, though she did play Rebecca in an episode of Wings, a sitcom about a Nantucket airline.

The highlight of her screen work before Cheers had been her performance as a Vulcan officer in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982), still one of the strongest of the Star Trek series. Other films, including Champions, starring John Hurt as the jockey Bob Champion, and the futuristic Tom Selleck adventure Runaway (both 1984), did little to boost her prospects.

She became a film star, though, with the comedy Look Who’s Talking (1989), even if she was inevitably upstaged by Bruce Willis, who provided her small child’s wise-cracking internal monologue. The movie grossed more than $297m worldwide, spawning two less popular sequels in which she and her original co-star John Travolta reprised their roles: Look Who’s Talking Too (1990) and Look Who’s Talking Now (1993).

Alley later starred in her own sitcom, Veronica’s Closet (1997-2000), in which she played the owner of a lingerie company. In one episode in the first season (Veronica’s $600,000 Pop), Danson has a guest role as her high-school crush, now working as a plumber.

She was born in Wichita, Kansas, to Robert, the owner of a lumber company, and Lillian, a housewife. From Wichita Southeast high school she went on to study liberal arts at Kansas State university before pursuing a career in interior design. Around this time, she became addicted to cocaine and later credited her recovery to the Church of Scientology.

Though her only screen appearances had been as a contestant on TV quiz shows, she enrolled in an acting class. A role in a student film led to agency representation. “I know some actors really study their asses off for years and they have a craft,” she said in 2013. “I’m just this starstruck fan who got lucky.”

She played Gloria Steinem in A Bunny’s Tale, a TV movie about the feminist writer’s month undercover in Hugh Hefner’s Playboy Club, and an abolitionist in the American civil war mini-series North and South (also 1985) and its 1986 sequel. She won a second Emmy for her performance as a woman with a son on the autism spectrum in the television film David’s Mother (1994). She was in Woody Allen’s Deconstructing Harry, and starred with Tim Allen as New Yorkers posing as an Amish couple to escape their tax debts in For Richer Or Poorer (both 1997).

In the barbed comedy Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999), she was amusingly deranged as a murderous former beauty pageant winner. She also appeared in Joyce Chopra’s Blonde (2001), a television adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates’s novel about Marilyn Monroe.

The tabloid media could be unkind in its reporting about her. “I was being attacked in the press for being fat,” she told Women’s Health in 2014. “I also remember that I owed the IRS a lot of money, and I needed to figure that out in 30 days.” Her response was to write the TV comedy series Fat Actress, in which she played herself. She sold it to the Showtime network, though its president, Bob Greenblatt, demurred at first. This prompted Alley to send him a delivery from Krispy Kreme with a note attached which read: “Maybe you’re not fat enough to get it. Have a doughnut.”

The show, which ran for one season in 2005, allowed her to cast vanity to the wind. She is seen pleading with Travolta to make Look Who’s Talking 4, badmouthing overweight stars such as James Gandolfini and John Goodman, and taking advice from an unhinged diet guru (played by Travolta’s wife, Kelly Preston).

In 2013-14, she was the lead in another single-season sitcom, Kirstie, as a Broadway star reconnecting with her estranged son; her former Cheers colleague Rhea Perlman played her PA. The following year, she was seen in Accidental Love, David O Russell’s bizarre unfinished comedy shot in 2008. Alley plays a chain-smoking vet who operates on an injured waitress while consulting Wikipedia for instructions.

She was one of the first stars to publicly congratulate Donald Trump on being elected president, and later claimed that her support of him had left her a pariah in Hollywood. Not that it deterred her: in 2020, she announced on Twitter that she was voting for him again.

Her first marriage, in 1970 to Bob Alley, with whom she coincidentally already shared her surname, ended in divorce in 1977. She is survived by her son, William True, and daughter, Lillie, from her second marriage, to Parker Stevenson, which ended in divorce in 1997, and by one grandson.",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/06/kirstie-alley-obituary,2022-12-06T00:00:00
148,‘People told us what a consolation it was’ – Toby Jones on the return of Detectorists,"If you ask actor Toby Jones what he did all day, the answer will often be a whole load of nothing. “You spend a lot of time waiting in my job. A lot of time hanging around,” he says, before detailing the previous day’s 11-hour schedule of kicking about on a Budapest industrial estate, punctuated by two brief stints shooting “quite a casual scene – me and the lead actor, in a car”.

It sounds like nothing much and yet clearly it’s something. At 56, Jones is widely considered to rank among Britain’s finest actors. Ever since his screen debut as “second valet” in Sally Potter’s Orlando 30 years ago, he has been in continuous demand: for spectacular Hollywood blockbusters, tiny independent art films and everything in between. As he summarises with characteristic humility: “On the whole, I get to do stuff that is really good and I don’t have to do a lot of stuff that isn’t very good.”

It's not gag, gag, gag. But the humour is there if you want it

So when we meet in a Parisian-style cafe off London’s Piccadilly, it is to discuss not one new project but four. There’s The Wonder, a beguiling period drama on Netflix now, in which Jones plays a doctor who alternately aids and hinders Florence Pugh’s miracle-investigating nurse; The Pale Blue Eye (out 23 December), an Edgar Allan Poe-inspired gothic mystery in which he’s the military surgeon who alternately aids and hinders Christian Bale’s sceptical detective; and Empire of Light (out 9 January), Sam Mendes’ ode to cinema, set in the early 80s, in which Jones is a projectionist whose character arc helpfully mirrors that of Olivia Colman’s protagonist.

It’s the return of Detectorists, however, for a feature-length Christmas special, that will most excite the Jones superfans. The Danebury Metal Detecting Club was first introduced on BBC Four in 2014, and over three sun-dappled series, the amateur archeologist duo of Lance (Jones) and Andy (show creator Mackenzie Crook) gently excavated themes such as community, mortality and ambition.

In 2019, Detectorists appeared alongside Fawlty Towers and Blackadder in Radio Times’ list of the 20 all-time greatest British sitcoms, the only entry to have originated after 2010. So even in a career as laden with gems as the Sutton Hoo site, this show is especially treasured. Crook and Jones agreed on that when they reunited to film the first new episode in five years: “Loads of people have contacted me and contacted him during lockdown about what a comfort and a consolation they found the show. The writing is kind of faultless.”

One of the show’s many pleasures is Lance and Andy’s lived-in friendship, yet Jones and Crook were near strangers until filming began: “We later worked out we’d been in about five or six of the same movies without ever having really met. We’d see each other in airports, one flying in and one out.” Their shared credits included the 2010 Ian Dury biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll, and 2011’s The Adventures of Tintin, but it wasn’t until 2014’s Muppets Most Wanted that their paths actually crossed. During another of those interminable on-set waits, Crook made his pitch: “We were just sitting there, and he’s very shy, and he went, ‘I hope you don’t mind, I’ve written this thing with you in mind, and I know that’s a nightmare, when someone says they’ve written something, and I don’t want you to feel under any obligation or anything …’ Anyway, he sent me three pages of this amazing dialogue. It was very, very funny but it wasn’t demanding to be laughed at, you know? Not gag, gag, gag. It’s like the show; it’s there if you want it.”

Jones winces when I ask if he also considers himself a writer: “I come up hard against the self-loathing of the first draft. Once we get to the second draft I’m OK.” But he clearly knows a good script when he reads one. He has also recently revived his writing collaboration with the playwright Tim Crouch. In 2019, they produced Don’t Forget the Driver, a criminally under-appreciated six-part BBC Two comedy series about a Bognor Regis coach driver (Jones) who discovers an asylum-seeker stowed away in his luggage compartment. They wrote a second series that got canned due to Covid (“heartbreaking”), but Jones says the pair’s new project “won’t be entirely unrelated to some of the themes, because they’re themes that are very much of now”.

Hopefully he will also write himself another lead role because, if there’s one problem with Toby Jones’s screen output, it’s that there’s not enough Toby Jones in it. When he has had the lead – as with his Truman Capote turn in Infamous, the BBC films Marvellous and Danny Boy, and Peter Strickland’s 2012 psychological horror Berberian Sound Studio – it has always resulted in exceptionally good drama. So has he considered storming into his agent’s office and declaring, “I’m never doing another supporting role again! I want the lead or nothing”?

“Er … have I considered that? No, I don’t think I’ve considered that. I think, if a script is good, there’s a lot of reasons for doing it, just to be associated with it. As long as there’s an arc to be found, it’s worth doing.” There are no small parts, he says, only a small-minded approach to the work: “I sort of feel, and maybe all actors feel, that you have everyone in you. And I think there’s almost a political dimension to that, about not seeing people as small. Everyone has huge potential, and rooms that they may not even know in their personalities, to go into.”

These are topics Jones has reflected on for longer than most, since acting runs in the family. His father, Freddie Jones, was well-known for David Lynch’s 1980 film The Elephant Man and as Sandy Thomas in soap opera Emmerdale, while his mother Jennifer Jones (née Heslewood) came from “a long line of actors, going back over 100 years”. Growing up near Oxford, as the eldest of three sons who’ve all gone into the business in some capacity, dinner table conversation was never “about academic ideas”; instead “they’d talk about emotions and stuff”, which teenage Toby “found profoundly embarrassing”.

These days, most of his social circle, including his barrister wife Karen, are not actors. His children complain that he is not showbiz enough, and should be getting them more invites to cool parties. Yet for all his humility, Jones is still an actor’s actor. It’s in his blood. And as such, the last thing you’ll get him to admit to is a particular character type that he’s most suited to playing (“The whole joy of my job is the sheer variety”), or any awareness of how the world sees him. He says he doesn’t even watch his own past work if he can help it. There is, however, one common thread in several recent roles that Jones recognises in himself: “I am quite meticulous as a person. I often find myself preoccupied with detail.”

As Lance is about Saxon artefacts, or Norman is about cinema etiquette, so Toby is about the nuances of human character: “I am, whether I like it or not, fascinated by what people do, how they do it, why they do it.” Where he differs significantly from the slightly awkward, introverted men he often plays on screen, is in a stylish ease of manner. He has a signature pork pie hat that he’s been wearing – and werking – for at least the last 15 years. I remember it from a previous interview for a magazine feature on up-and-coming British actors in which, I remind him, he shared a double-page spread with Tom Hardy. “Oh yeah … whatever happened to him?”

Jones has developed the intense cultural passions of his younger years, continuing to collect records and go to local gigs in whatever town he finds himself in – albeit with diminishing returns. “I read that new book Nick Cave has done with Sean O’Hagan, Faith, Hope and Carnage. An extraordinary book. Incredible. And he was talking about a kind of boredom with listening to music now compared to adolescence, when the urgency was just fundamental and it’s life or death. I had that with music, definitely. And I think I’m always chasing that.” On a recent day off in Budapest, he stumbled across the one record shop in the city he’d yet to visit: “I was there for about 20 minutes, looking through all this dreadful Hungarian disco, before I thought, ‘What am I doing here?’ And I think I’m just chasing that old feeling. I still have extraordinary moments, seeing a play or a movie, or a gig. But they’re rarer.”

This is where the acting comes in, because in Jones’s telling of an actor’s life, even the boring bits sound like a romantic adventure: “To be driving out at four in the morning to some remote place … Or to get off a plane in the Czech Republic and there’s a driver there and you get in the car but you can’t speak any Czech … I’m still sort of in love with disappearing into this parallel world.”",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/06/consolation-toby-jones-detectorists-mackenzie-crook-christmas-special,2022-12-06T00:00:00
149,Christmas Bloody Christmas review – Robo-Claus rampage in seasonal slasher,"’Tis the season for genre film-makers and distributors to cash in with horror-themed Christmas movies. So if current hit Violent Night sounds a little too classy and mainstream, then here is this shoddily made but tinsel-bright gift for you, the cinematic equivalent of a cheap soap and body lotion set bought at the last minute. It’s serviceable, but not a lot of thought went into it.

Adding to the corpus of films about Santas who are not just bad but positively evil (see also Krampus, Rare Exports et al), Christmas Bloody Christmas builds its plot around an animatronic toy-shop Santa Claus robot that suddenly develops a murderous instinct. Before the mayhem commences, however, the film spends time with record-store owner Tori (Riley Dandy) and her employee-friend Robbie (Sam Delich), two likable cool kids with opinions on all sorts of bands, movies and leisure activities that they ceaselessly bicker over. In fact, their fluent, lively dialogue and simmering flirtation feels surprisingly spontaneous and authentic, to the point where one rather dreads that the mayhem will soon start and all conversation will turn to various kinds of screaming. As Tori and Robbie visit some friends in a neighbouring shop and then make their way to a dive bar, the Robo-Claus comes to life and starts killing all and sundry.

It’s never clearly explained why this electronic Father Christmas is so intent on killing Tori and Robbie when surely there are plenty of other people to attack, but you get the sense writer-director Joe Begos wasn’t so interested in motivation and logic. Sadly, that makes the film less engaging, but it must be acknowledged that Dandy is outstanding in the role of the lead/last girl, showing off real comic chops in the early running and then screaming with terror like a champ in the later stages. She might go far if she can break out of doing Christmas movies. Also fun is the lurid lighting design, which looks as if the whole set was illuminated only by various hues of fairy lights.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/07/christmas-bloody-christmas-review-robo-claus-on-the-rampage,2022-12-07T00:00:00
150,‘I will outshine them all’: the enduring genius of Bloc Party,"When emo legends Paramore made their comeback with new single This Is Why in October, something about its blend of danceable guitar work and lyrical anxiety felt more than a little familiar. Speaking on her BBC podcast Everything Is Emo, frontwoman Hayley Williams revealed an unlikely source of inspiration for her band’s new direction and, indeed, their career as a whole.

“From day one, Bloc Party was the number one reference because there was such an urgency to their sound that was different to the fast punk or the pop-punk or the loud ‘wall of sound’ emo bands that were happening in the early 2000s,” she said. “They had their own thing and it really stuck with us … it just makes me feel even more excited to get back out into the world, and maybe cross paths with the band that has been a huge part of our story.”

As it turns out, Williams wasn’t willing to leave things to chance: early next year, Paramore will be taking Bloc Party out as main support on multiple legs of their sold-out 2023 world tour. It crystallises something that has been percolating over the past few years. Although Bloc Party may have faded from mainstream view in the mid-2010s, in 2022, a generation of new alternative artists including Willow, Genesis Owusu and Connie Constance are tapping into the indie disco heroes’ legacy.

Paramore: This Is Why – video

Bloc Party’s rise to prominence feels like a quintessentially 2000s tale. Bumping into each other at the 1999 Reading festival, friends Russell Lissack and Kele Okereke decided to start a band, putting an ad in the NME in search of a Joy Division-loving bassist, eventually recruiting drummer Matt Tong after eight other contenders didn’t quite fit the bill. They broke through after delivering demo CDs and polite letters to Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand as well as Steve Lamacq, who promptly declared them “genius”.

Channelling the spirit of Radiohead’s OK Computer, Bloc Party imbued their early work with a distinctive velocity. They borrowed from the dance-punk that was making stars of the Rapture and LCD Soundsystem over in the US, matched the catchiness of their commercially minded peers and extended their reach into other realms, such as house, grime and R&B. Okereke was a fan of hip-hop producer Timbaland (see the band’s excellent 2009 Live Lounge cover of Nelly Furtado’s Say It Right), and his omnivorous tastes meant that Bloc Party appealed to the open-minded listener, whether they were a hardened Gang of Four fan or a desert scarf-wearing, glowstick-toting underage raver.

For teens in the mid-2000s, Bloc Party were part of your average NME starter pack: Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs, Hard-Fi. But they pushed beyond the idea of making indie disco music for uni students to sink pints to, and the razor-sharp, stabbing Telecasters on their debut album, Silent Alarm, felt like a revelation. Nominated for the 2005 Mercury prize, it was celebrated as a record that felt energising yet introspective, capturing a sense of youthful ennui.

Bloc Party’s second album, 2007’s A Weekend in the City, made an even greater impact with its bird’s-eye view of the tumultuous British political landscape. The low hum of lead single The Prayer, with its cavernous drums and unabashed earnestness (“I will dazzle / I will outshine them all”), could be considered a perfect intersection of indie and emo.

The album discussed issues that have taken on more significance in broader culture in the years since: personal trauma as public entertainment, hedonism as a balm for extreme loneliness, queer love stories in a world that expects you to feel shame, racist surveillance and brutality. Musically, Okereke’s melodic constructions paved the way for many of the more interesting guitar bands that came after; you can hear A Weekend in the City in the math-rock flourishes of Foals, Everything Everything’s intricate wordplay and the Maccabees’ poignant sentimentality.

This musical triumph didn’t always come easy. Famously characterised by Liam Gallagher as looking like members of a “University Challenge team”, Bloc Party were often lampooned for leaning too far into their intellectual indie tag. Their website in the early years featured a bold manifesto (“Bloc Party is an autonomous unit of un-extraordinary kids reared on pop culture between the years of 1976 and the present day …”), while Okereke frequently cited lofty literary inspirations, gleefully critiquing the scene’s less artistically inclined bands (Towers of London, anyone?).

A comedown from the Britpop era of big, playful personalities, this serious approach earned them a reputation for being uptight, not always inclined to play ball with the music press. “In the nine months since they were hailed as ‘the sound of 2005’, the London quartet have managed to cultivate a reputation for prickly reticence,” wrote the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis that year. “Despite their gripping stage presence, they seem utterly at odds with the prevalent notion of how a rock band should be.”

Looking back, any potential prickliness on Okereke’s side may have been a frustrated response to journalists who seemed more concerned with pinning down his sexuality and racialised experiences than discussing his music. Raised in Essex by Nigerian parents, Okereke was an outlier in a sea of predominantly white indie artists, and was frequently expected to carry the 00s mantle of Black ambassadorship alone, save for the odd mention of TV on the Radio or the Noisettes. In 2008, this division was magnified even further following an altercation with John Lydon, who Okereke claimed attacked him verbally and physically in a racist tirade backstage at a music festival – which Lydon denied.

Today, Okereke’s status as a genuine pioneer is clearer: we recognise what a feat it was for a Black, gay man to front one of the most enduring British groups of a less enlightened era. Beyond identity politics, however, he and his band also cemented the way in which guitar bands could defy tradition. Long before being genreless was the genre du jour, Bloc Party embodied the new frontier of online culture where torrenting and streaming made delineations between sounds feel almost arbitrary. (The upcoming shows with Paramore are not their first brush with MTV-era emo: in 2006, the band completed three dates supporting Panic! at the Disco before Matt Tong’s lung collapsed and they were forced to pull out.)

All these years later, Bloc Party’s influence can be heard in a disparate array of artists, not least the emerging Black and mixed-race musicians who grew up with Okereke as a tangible inspiration. Silent Alarm’s This Modern Love was only an album track, but it crops up time and time again as an example of quintessential indie songwriting; you can hear its influence in Rachel Chinouriri’s I’m Not Perfect (But I’m Trying) and Connie Constance’s Costa Del Margate. Both Willow’s Hover Like a Goddess and Genesis Owusu’s Get Inspired borrow from Okereke’s pacey guitar lines and vocals respectively, nodding towards Bloc Party’s punkier end.

Promising newcomer KennyHoopla apparently decided to pursue music seriously after discovering their work on a late-night YouTube binge. (A few years ago, he almost cried when I suggested to him that his single How Will I Rest in Peace If I’m Buried By a Highway? would likely earn the band’s approval.) At 25, Hoopla is only three years older than Okereke was when Silent Alarm was released, but he is now inspiring a new generation of his own – young Black kids who feel emboldened by the success of somebody who looks like them.

Willow: Hover Like a Goddess – video

Much of what is happening in 2022 feels eerily similar to the landscape of 2007, when Bloc Party released A Weekend in the City: austerity and financial instability, political division, intense reflections on the balance between community and the individual. The Overload, Yard Act’s Mercury-nominated tale of reluctant capitalism, feels like a thematic descendent; Anywhere But Here, the excellent new release by London band Sorry, also carries the indie dance music torch, blending the twinkly light and sinister shade of disco, punk and pop. Whatever your interpretation of indie might be, it seems difficult to play a guitar in 2022 without channelling some of Bloc Party’s fractious energy, driven by the cyclic frustrations of the world.

Nearly 17 years on from their debut, some fans may have scratched their heads at the idea of Bloc Party touring in support of Paramore. But when you break it down, this union is a perfect example of exactly how far both indie and mainstream rock has come. Frontwomen or bandleaders of colour can be found in positions of mainstream visibility, melding sounds and scenes without a second thought. Confident, boundary-pushing musicians are increasingly praised for their vision and self-protection, no longer misunderstood as being standoffish for cheap gags.

Like Paramore themselves, Bloc Party have had to counter their fair share of criticisms and controversial lineup changes, but they have also proved that a long-lasting career is possible if you are bold and willing to look beyond the expectations of industry gatekeepers. Where both bands had to struggle to stake their claim in their respective mid-00s scenes, together, in 2022, they seem right at home.",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/06/i-will-outshine-them-all-the-enduring-genius-of-bloc-party,2022-12-06T00:00:00
151,Santa Claus is coming to frown! Why the best Christmas songs are sad and slow,"The loss of Low’s Mimi Parker last month, at the age of 55, got me thinking about the power of sad songs. With her husband and band partner Alan Sparhawk, Parker was responsible for one of the most downbeat festive albums ever made: Christmas, from 1999. From its spectral version of Little Drummer Boy to a cover of Blue Christmas sung at what sounds like half-speed, its eight tracks remained faithful to the Minnesota band’s melancholic indie sound. The opener begins with this harrowing observation about Jesus’s birthday: “If you were born today, we’d kill you by age eight.”

It’s one of the most sorrowful-sounding seasonal albums ever – but also one of the best. Little surprise if it has passed you by: we don’t pay nearly enough attention to the gift of truly sad Christmas songs. When compiling yuletide playlists, we prefer the manically jolly over the miserable. We’re happy to hear Noddy Holder screaming like an axe-wielding killer, but something approaching the true loneliness, grief and weltschmerz of the darkest time of the year? Many of us would rather scroll on by.

I’m not talking here about the joyous nihilism of the Pogues, or the poppy heartache of Last Christmas, whose narrator is already planning to re-gift his heart within the twelvemonth. Nor do I mean the awkward feels elicited by Do They Know It’s Christmas? – though we’ve all experienced the guilt of belting out the bridge and realising we’re having far too good a time singing about dread and fear. No, for real pathos you need something extra. Bittersweet melodies, lyrics that cut deeper the more time you spend with them. Something that can play on the most untuned of heartstrings, a voice that could wring tears even from Scrooged’s Frank Cross. A spot of Sarah McLachlan, a swig of Sufjan Stevens, someone covering Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas in the most mournful tones they can muster.

I first encountered that last example in an episode of 2Point4 Children in which the kids got separated from their parents, and it has haunted me ever since. It’s not the despair that kills you but the battered belief in a better future. Written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane for the 1943 musical Meet Me in St Louis, and first sung by Judy Garland, it’s a song full of poignant cadences that are a perfect fit for its wistful sentiment. Or at least they were, until Frank Sinatra insisted on replacing the lyrics with cheerier lines: “Until then, we’ll have to muddle through somehow” turned into “hang a shining star upon the nearest bough”.

During lockdown we all learned that few things feel lonelier than a lonely Christmas. On your tod at Easter, or going stag for summer solstice? You’ll get by. December, though, is cold and cruelly isolating, which is why yearning yuletide tunes are so powerful: Joni Mitchell’s River; John Prine’s Christmas in Prison. What price Geldof’s clanging chimes of doom when you’ve got the opening bells of the bluesy intro to Charles Brown’s Please Come Home For Christmas? (Follow up question: is there a sadder end to a line than “I have no friends”?)

Plenty of lonesome-without-you numbers (many middling to awful) have hijacked the holiday season and our susceptible ears with them. Only Prince could create a jewel of the genre and perform it just once: Another Lonely Christmas, the B-side to I Would Die 4 U, remains brilliantly obscure. It sounds like a regular tale of she-done-me-wrong until the shock reveal that actually she died – on the 25th no less! – and he’s managing his grief with banana daiquiris. As set-ups to guitar solos go, “Your father said it was pneumonia, your mother said it was stress” is pretty unforgiving, while the final organ outro lends a neat funereal touch.

Festivals of light don’t just illuminate the darkness, they draw attention to it, which is probably why Motown never released Marvin Gaye’s I Want to Come Home for Christmas – sung from the point of view of a Vietnam-prisoner-of-war – during his lifetime. Simon and Garfunkel’s 7 O’Clock News/Silent Night, with its counterpoint of depressing headlines and angelic vocals, is a hard listen at the best of times, let alone when you’re trying to drown your worries in supermarket own-brand Bailey’s.

152,"Charlotte review – absorbing animation about a remarkable artist, murdered at Auschwitz","This powerful but flawed animation depicts the brilliant German Jewish artist Charlotte Salomon, creator of a remarkable series of quasi-autobiographical gouaches entitled Life? or Theatre?, painted in the period of her exile in Vichy France from 1941 to 1943, before she was taken to Auschwitz and there murdered at the age of 26; the paintings themselves are now held in Amsterdam’s Jewish Museum.

The movie is part of a vital tradition of representing the Holocaust through powerful animated images, stemming back to Art Spiegelman’s graphic novel Maus. Screenwriters Erik Rutherford and David Bezmozgis have worked from the narrative suggested by the artwork, but also from a confessional document that remained unpublished until 2015, in which Salomon revealed, among other things, that she murdered her grandfather. The directors are TV animators Tahir Rana (making his feature debut) and Éric Warin; Keira Knightley (and Marion Cotillard in the French language version) voices Salomon, who was a talented young artist in early 1930s Berlin. Her father Albert (Eddie Marsan) is a prosperous doctor and decorated first world war veteran, and stepmother Paula is a renowned classical singer; she is voiced by Helen McCrory, in her final film role.

As the Nazi tyranny tightens, Charlotte is sent away by her parents to live in the south of France with her ailing, stricken grandmother (Brenda Blethyn) and glowering, increasingly angry grandfather (Jim Broadbent), a man embittered by the injustices of fate, antisemitic abuse and by the terrible history of suicide in the family, which has been kept secret from Charlotte. The three live initially in a handsome villa owned by a sympathetic American patron, Ottilie Moore (Sophie Okonedo), and it is in France that Charlotte begins to pour out her soul in her paintings, and where she (by her own admission) later killed her widowed grandfather.

This is an absorbingly told story; Knightley’s vocal performance is engaging and Charlotte’s face, in particular, is strongly and expressively drawn. But the film arguably fudges one of the most important issues of Charlotte’s life: her grandfather’s abusive relationshipwith her. It is shown here as mere unpleasant bad temper and cruel invective on his part, but Salomon, in the same posthumously published manuscript that is a source for the murder scene, indicated that he wanted to share her bed.

The film-makers have argued that there is not enough clear evidence for sexual abuse for this to be included. That is legitimate artistic prerogative. Creative licence is in any case in the spirit of the paintings themselves. But having taken at face value Charlotte’s claim to have poisoned her grandfather, it is disconcerting for this film to ignore abuse as motive, to omit any indication of the dysfunctional and predatory behaviour that would certainly explain Charlotte’s killing him. The murder is frankly unmotivated here; and even if it were supposed to be a type of euthanasia, a mercy killing for a wretched and defeated old man, that too is unsatisfactorily represented. It does not, though, detract from the wider force and sympathy of the story being told.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/07/charlotte-review-salomon-keira-knightley-german-jewish-painter-grandfather,2022-12-07T00:00:00
153,Tinsel tragedies: the worst Christmas tree displays across Australia,"A humble Christmas tree in a New South Wales town has gone viral for being lauded as the worst display of festive spirit ever.

The dishevelled tree – which looks like it arrived home after a 24-hour bender, slapped on some makeup and covered itself in tinsel – was erected in the main square of Port Macquarie to cries of dismay and horror.

Port Macquarie’s council initially took it all in their stride, with mayor Peta Pinson declaring “any publicity is good publicity”. But that was before the lights had to be removed when they were deemed a safety risk due to slowly slipping from the tree.

“I have a great sense of humour, just like our wonderful community has,” Pinson said. “All you can do is laugh.”

The council has now reportedly replaced the tree with a more traditional option – a smaller, artificial tree that was decorated by council staff.

In the cosmopolitan city of Hobart, they don’t decorate actual trees, but rather abstract representations of items that resemble them. This one is serving “croquembouche chic” and I, for one, am sold.

Never before has a tree so accurately resembled a jumbled pile of coat hangers. If that was what they were going for – they nailed it. This structure, erected in a Melbourne office, gives a whole new meaning to the very concept of the Christmas tree.

Does it need to be green to be a Christmas tree? Does it need lights? Tinsel? Or can you just whack on a couple of green and red rocket ships and call it a day?

Australia’s most festive coat stand

The cost of living crisis bit one Melbourne office hard this year, forcing it to improvise with vaguely tree-shaped items that were already on hand in place of the real thing.

The result is the most unhinged coat stand I’ve ever seen and what looks like a small tipi with a carpet of tinsel. The hanging candy canes are a seriously creative touch that somehow tie the whole thing together.

Bliss!

‘There was a little owl hiding in it’

Australia has its fair share of dud Christmas trees, but some of the worst performances have been abroad.

We should have known 2021 would be another cursed year when this Christmas tree arrived at New York’s Rockefeller Centre – already beaten, defeated and on its last legs.

Later, it was revealed there was a small owl hiding in the tree, provoking yet more outrage and disgust.

Everything about this display is bad – from the garish, over-the-top tinsel to the tacky stand, and what looks like a tissue emerging from its midriff. But the worst part is the self awareness.

154,‘Nobody knows what’s wrong with me’ – life with an undiagnosed condition,"Mandy Hughes was nine weeks pregnant with her daughter, Polly, when she was told her baby might not survive. She and her husband went through dozens of tests before doctors discovered their baby had an enlarged heart. It was a devastating blow, but after the birth, it soon became clear that Polly’s challenges were just beginning.

“She dropped below her birth weight and wasn’t feeding properly or meeting milestones,” says Mandy, 42, who lives in Builth Wells, Wales. At four months old, Polly was referred for heart treatment, but her condition continued to deteriorate. It was two years before she was able to sit up by herself, and she was constantly unwell. “She was vomiting 24 hours a day – I don’t know how she survived,” says Mandy. “There were nights it was like she was drowning in her own sick – it was horrific. She could just about tolerate enough milk to survive but not enough to put on weight.”

As a toddler, Polly had an operation to prevent vomiting, but that caused other complications, including severe pain. “She is now one of a handful of children in Wales to receive jejunalfeeding, which goes directly into the small bowel because she can’t tolerate it into the stomach,” says Mandy. She has regular hospital visits for feeding, and requires 24/7 care from two adults. But, despite the severity of her condition and many rounds of genetic testing, a cause for her symptoms has never been found.

At six years old, Polly is one of approximately 6,000 children born in the UK each year with a Syndrome Without a Name (Swan). “One of the hardest things when you don’t have a diagnosis is that you don’t know what treatments might help and what the outlook might be,” says Mandy. “When we go for appointments we have to repeat everything to all the different people involved in Polly’s care and the number of different clinicians we have to see is overwhelming.”

For their family, hope is on the horizon after the opening of the new Swan clinic at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Commissioned by the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee and funded by the Welsh government, the clinic is the first of its kind in the UK, and has been introduced to improve care pathways for people living with rare, undiagnosed conditions. “We are waiting for our first appointment,” says Mandy. “We don’t know for sure if we will get any answers but at least this gives us some hope. Knowing what her condition is might affect the decisions I make about her care.”

The Swan clinic will initially run as a pilot for two years and aims to shorten the time patients wait for a diagnosis, as well as improving medical knowledge and research. The clinic’s launch has been supported by Swan UK, a charity support network established to help families who are struggling to manage undiagnosed and extremely rare conditions. Run by Genetic Alliance UK, it works with affected people directly, as well as offering education services to health and social care professionals.

Caring for someone with complex needs is really challenging and really lonely Mandy Hughes

According to Louise Fish, Genetic Alliance UK’s chief executive, about 50% of children undergoing genetic testing in the UK won’t get a confirmed diagnosis. “It could be because a condition is so rare that it has never been seen before and, therefore, isn’t tested for, or it could be an unusual presentation of a known condition,” she says.

Regardless of the reason, the ramifications for families are huge. As well as dealing with the emotional aspects of the uncertainty, a study by Rare Disease UK showed that 73% of people felt that a lack of diagnosis made it harder to access the right services, while four in five people found it difficult to access coordinated care.

For Hayley Clark, 38, a teaching assistant, and her husband Anthony, 45, a coach driver, from Newcastle, it has been a “constant battle” to get help for their undiagnosed eight-year-old son, Harrison, who lives with profound and complex needs, which include global developmental delay, visual impairment, brain shrinkage, and the inability to feel and process pain in the same way as other children. “I’ve had to fight to get certain equipment in the house, like a hoist to move him around as he’s not able to walk,” says Hayley.

While this family has had brilliant support from the local community and Swan UK, not all charities are able to offer support without a specific diagnosis. “There’s a lot of places we can’t go as a family, and I’ve felt guilty that my two older children have missed out too,” says Hayley. “But Harrison has made us appreciate life. We were thrown into this world of additional needs and learned to adapt. He’s extremely determined and loves his school.”

Last year, Harrison took part in the 100,000 Genomes Project, which investigates the role of genome sequencing in rare diseases. Initially, his family were hoping the tests could provide answers, but now they have mixed feelings about the potential results. “Harrison missed a lot of early milestones, but it took 10 months for me to be taken seriously,” says Hayley. “When a paediatrician finally told me there was something very wrong, I was Googling everything I could and we were referred for every test under the sun. But he is such a happy child, we’ve just accepted him as he is and we live in our bubble. If a diagnosis can help him then I want to know, but I’m also really scared of what they might say.”

Anthony feels the same way. “I don’t know how we’d cope if there is a diagnosis and we’re told it’s a life-limiting condition,” he says. “Watching other children grow and develop their independence sometimes brings a tear to my eye as I know Harrison will never have that, and I do worry what the future will bring. At the same time, I wouldn’t change him for the world because it’s what makes him him.”

In the UK, rare genetic diseases disproportionately affect children, with 30% of those affected dying before their fifth birthday. But, for some people, conditions can manifest or worsen later in life. Esta Watson, 26, from Yorkshire, suffered mild cognitive and physical disabilities through childhood due to an unknown genetic condition. When she was 16, her health rapidly declined, with symptoms including loss of bladder function, extreme fatigue, chronic pain, memory loss and recurrent infections.

After 17 years of investigations, she was finally told she had a rare genetic condition called Triple X. However, the diagnosis didn’t explain or fit with Esta’s new symptoms, and doctors suspected she has a second underlying condition. “She took part in the study to try to find the cause,” says her mother, Ruth, 53. “We were really hopeful about that but it returned no further results.”

The lack of understanding about her condition has taken its toll on Esta’s mental and physical health. “I get bounced all over the place between different services because nobody knows what’s wrong with me or what to do with me,” she says.

Esta now lives in her own flat with 24-hour support from her team of carers. But, without a name for her condition, she finds it hard to meet others in the same boat. She makes every effort to live as well as she can, and has joined a weekly exercise class for people with neurological conditions. “I did manage to get a place to study health and social care but I had to drop out. My bladder problems started around the same time and it was so embarrassing if my incontinence pads fell out of my bag.”

Too exhausted to study from home, Esta finds it difficult to take part in meaningful activities and is unable to work, which impacts her overall wellbeing. Ruth, 53, has also had to give up work as a support worker in education to care for her daughter. “Before I became really ill, we used to go on holidays and long walks,” says Esta. “As well as not knowing what’s wrong, I also feel as though I am grieving for my old life. It’s hard to look at Facebook and see people getting married and having families. I can barely walk around the house.”

Ruth believes the hardest aspect of her daughter’s condition is the lack of control over her future, and that of their family. “Fear is always in the back of your mind. We’ve almost lost Esta on several occasions and the uncertainty is really scary. We also don’t know if her sister is a carrier because we don’t know what it is. She’s healthy, but there’s a risk she passes something on to her children.”

As well as family planning challenges, Fish says many Swans and their families aren’t believed when they seek help. “Parents are labelled as neurotic by health and social care professionals, friends and even their own family members. It can have a detrimental impact, leading to them feeling frustrated, isolated and alone,” she says.

This has been the case for Laura Parkes, 33, from Northamptonshire, who has a nine-year-old son with a rare undiagnosed condition, as well as being ill herself. “Charlie was diagnosed with a brain anomaly during a scan in pregnancy and we were told he might never walk or talk,” she says. “He spent most of his early years in hospital, which had a huge impact on our family.” Although he had a wide range of complex symptoms, which included seizure-like episodes, breathing difficulties, low muscle tone and feeding issues, a cause couldn’t be found.

“I have a lot of residual trauma from that period because it felt like I wasn’t believed. I was made to feel as though it was my neurosis making Charlie ill, when in reality I was fighting for him. I felt guilty as well because I spent so much time in hospital and my relationship with my daughter suffered.” Eventually Charlie began to improve and met many key milestones, including walking, talking and attending school.

I was made to feel as though it was my neurosis making Charlie ill, when I was fighting for him Laura Parkes

“He still has episodes where his blood pressure will drop dramatically and he just starts vomiting and collapses,” Laura says. “He also has sleep dysfunction and possible ADHD and autism. These have been hard to get assessments for, because, for a long time, doctors didn’t know if they were just symptoms of his genetic condition.”

As he got better, Laura was faced with her own health challenges. In 2018, her bladder stopped working after a gallstones operation. Since then she has developed numerous infections, bowel failure, hypermobility and vitamin malabsorption which causes brain fog and fatigue. Although she used to run a floral design business, she was forced to give it up when she became ill. “Like Charlie, I have been tested for everything but nobody can find any answers,” she says.

Her husband, Steve, 44, has taken a step back from work as a sports centre management consultant in order to spend more time caring for his family. “I tend to focus more on the symptoms and what needs to be done to help them both out,” he says. “But the diagnosis comes into play with services, and as much as you’re told a label doesn’t make a difference, our experience says it definitely does.”

Despite the challenges of living with such complex conditions, Laura says they have built new friendships and networks. “We have found our tribe through other parents in the same position as us. You also develop a dark sense of humour, too. It’s one of these things where it’s laugh or cry, and if I started crying I’m not sure I would stop.”

Whether someone is living with an undiagnosed condition or caring for a loved one, coping mechanisms are extremely important. “Caring for someone with complex needs is really challenging and lonely,” says Mandy. “I reached breaking point when I had to give up my job as a hairdresser. I’d lost so many friends because people didn’t know what to say to me.”

She began working with charities in Wales, including Credu, which supports carers, and it has given her a new lease of life. “We get amazing support from charities, so I feel incredibly privileged to work with them now.”

Mandy feels that disability and undiagnosed conditions are poorly understood, but she is proud to be making positive change happen. “Even with the most complex diseases, if you carry on reaching out, you will find a network to support you. It’s hard to describe how hard it is to people who aren’t affected. As a family, we don’t want expensive things. We just want a simple life where Polly can live as well as possible.”",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/06/nobody-knows-what-is-wrong-with-me-life-with-an-undiagnosed-condition,2022-12-06T00:00:00
155,House January 6 panel to issue criminal referrals to DoJ as tensions heighten,"The House January 6 select committee will make criminal referrals to the US justice department in connection with its investigation into the Capitol attack, the chairman of the panel said Tuesday, heightening tensions ahead of the release of its final report expected to come later this month.



The targets and details about the referrals were not immediately clear, and the panel’s chairman Bennie Thompson affirmed to reporters only that the panel would issue citations.

But the decision to move forward with referrals comes days after a special four-member subcommittee established to consider the issue recommended that the full committee seek prosecution from the justice department for a number of individuals connected to January 6, two sources said.



The referrals could follow two tracks: citations for things that Congress can request prosecution by statute, such as perjury or witness tampering, or wider-ranging recommendations such as making the case that Donald Trump obstructed an official proceeding on 6 January.

At issue is the value of making referrals when the justice department could now be in a better position to asses potential crimes.

The department in recent months has intensified its own parallel, criminal investigations into the Capitol attack and Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, subpoenaing dozens of Trump advisors and January 6 rally organizers to testify before at least two federal grand juries in Washington.

The select committee might have once argued that it made sense to issue referrals for instance for lying to Congress because it alone could determine whether witnesses had made false statements to investigators.

But with the panel committed to releasing all of its evidence and transcripts alongside the final report, the department might now be best placed to identify false or contradictory statements to Congress, given how federal prosecutors have now interviewed many of the same witnesses.

The justice department has also previously issued charges even when Congress did not make overt referrals; Trump confidante Roger Stone was indicted and convicted in 2019 for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing a House investigation when he appeared before the House intelligence committee.



The four-member subcommittee led by Congressman Jamie Raskin and the other members with legal backgrounds – the vice-chair Liz Cheney, Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren – made its recommendations about referrals and subpoena noncompliance by Republican members of Congress privately on Friday.

The move is likely to lead to intense speculation as the committee puts the finishing touches on its report into the insurrection at the Capitol and those who took part in it and the build up to the attack.

The committee held a series of often dramatic public hearings over the summer where it presented some of its evidence and testimony from the many witnesses it called. The picture the committee painted was one of a plot to foil the certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election win that was orchestrated by Donald Trump and some of his key allies in his White House.



“The committee has determined that referrals to outside entities should be considered as a final part of its work. The committee will make decisions about specifics in the days ahead,” a spokesman for the panel said in a statement.

The work of the committee has been the target of often baseless attacks by Trump and many others in the Republican party, who have sought to portray it as a partisan effort, despite the prominence of two rebel Republicans on the panel. But the narrow victory in the House by Republicans in last month’s midterm elections means it will now certainly be wound up as the party takes control of the lower chamber of Congress.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/january-6-panel-criminal-referrals-doj-capitol-attack,2022-12-06T00:00:00
156,Trump Pac reportedly paid legal bills of Mar-a-Lago witnesses,"A report published by the Washington Post claims that money from Donald Trump’s political action committee paid the legal bills of some witnesses involved in the US justice department’s criminal inquiry into the former president’s improper handling of classified documents.

They include the former Trump adviser Kash Patel, who was granted immunity last month for his grand jury testimony, the newspaper says, citing anonymous sources said to be familiar with the matter.

Another is the valet Walt Nauda, who told FBI agents that he had moved boxes at Trump’s direction around his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida while the government was trying to retrieve documents and records that should have been preserved in Washington DC, according to the Post.

The payment of witnesses’ legal fees by a political group whose purse strings Trump controls, while not illegal, raises ethical concerns and poses a conflict, the Post says.

It quotes former federal prosecutor Jim Walden, who questioned if the payments to witnesses’ lawyers by the Trump fund influenced their testimony or level of cooperation.

“It looks like the Trump political action committee is either paying for the silence of these witnesses, for them to take the fifth [amendment] or for favorable testimony,” he said, referring to the constitutional protection against self-incrimination.

“These circumstances should look very suspicious to the justice department, and there’s a judicial mechanism for them to get court oversight if there’s a conflict.”

Federal investigators are already looking into Trump Save America Pac, and in September subpoenaed two of the former president’s advisers, senior aide Stephen Miller and ex-director of White House political affairs Brian Jack, over fundraising for efforts to reverse his 2020 election defeat.

The Guardian has reported previously how Trump retained documents bearing classification markings, along with communications from after his presidency, at his Florida resort following his departure from the White House in January 2021.

FBI agents raided Trump’s private members’ club in August and uncovered thousands of documents, including hundreds marked classified, that his legal team insisted had already been returned to government archives. Nauda, the valet, told FBI investigators that Trump directed him to move boxes of documents around the property.

The justice department’s criminal investigation is looking into whether Trump mishandled national security information, including whether he destroyed documents.

Patel, who has already appeared before a grand jury in the case, is a key witness for his knowledge of the final days of the Trump administration and whether the ousted president, as he has insisted, moved to declassify documents he took with him to Florida.

A judge granted immunity to Patel, who served in several lower-level positions in the Trump government, last month, ruling that the offer was the only way to guarantee his testimony. The Post report appears to cast doubt on the authenticity of that evidence.

The report says Patel and Nauta are represented by the Washington DC attorneys Brand Woodward Law, which according to its website has experience in “white-collar defense” and “government and congressional investigations”.

Public records show Trump’s Pac paid more than $120,000 to the firm. Stan Brand, the firm’s leading lawyer, told the Post there was “nothing improper” about the payments.

“There’s no bar against third parties paying for legal fees as long as it’s disclosed to the client. The ethical obligation of the lawyer is to the client,” Brand said.

“This is a tempest in a teapot and another cheap shot at these people because of who they work for.”

The justice department investigation has ramped up in recent weeks, with the attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointing an independent special counsel last month to oversee its pace and direction. The veteran prosecutor and former justice department official Jack Smith will also supervise a parallel inquiry into Trump’s efforts to subvert the 2020 election.

The former president suffered a significant blow last week in his attempt to delay the documents inquiry when a federal appeals court removed a special master previously appointed to review the seized papers.

It paved the way for the justice department to regain access to the entirety of the materials for use in the criminal investigation.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/trump-pac-reportedly-paid-legal-bills-mar-a-lago-witnesses,2022-12-06T00:00:00
157,First Thing: Democrats celebrate as Raphael Warnock wins Georgia runoff,"Good morning.

The Democratic incumbent, Raphael Warnock, has fended off a challenge from Republican Herschel Walker and won the Georgia Senate runoff, securing his first full term and delivering a 51st seat to bolster his party’s majority in the chamber.

The Associated Press called the race about three-and-a-half hours after polls closed in Georgia, as Warnock led Walker, by approximately 40,000 votes.

Shortly after that, Warnock took the stage at his campaign’s victory party to thank his supporters. A pastor at the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr once preached, Warnock has held one of Georgia’s two Senate seats since winning a special election in 2021. As he began his remarks in Atlanta, supporters chanted: “Six more years!”

Warnock told the crowd: “After a hard-fought campaign – or should I say campaigns – it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy: the people have spoken.”

How did Walker respon d? Walker conceded, acknowledging that his campaign had fallen short and expressing gratitude to his team. The Republican explicitly thanked election officials who ensured the runoff was managed effectively, quelling concerns he might refuse to accept the result.

Is Walker’s loss a bad omen for Trumpism? In a normal political universe, David Smith writes, Walker’s defeat would be the final nail in Trump’s political coffin. The former American football star was the ultimate Trumpian candidate. Trump, however, arguably remains the favourite for the Republican nomination in 2024. The next election could spell the rebirth or the death of Trumpism.

Trump Organization guilty of tax fraud, New York jury finds

A jury in New York has convicted the Trump Organization of criminal tax fraud in a stinging rebuke of the former US president’s company.

Although Donald Trump was not personally on trial, prosecutors in the case brought by the Manhattan district attorney insisted he was fully aware of the long-running scheme in which they said executives were enriched by off-the-books perks to make up for lower salaries, reducing the company’s tax liabilities.

“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement celebrating the guilty verdict. “In Manhattan, no corporation is above the law.”

The 12-person jury in New York’s state court was sent out to deliberate on Monday morning after a six-week trial in which Trump Organization lawyers pinned blame for the fraud solely on the greed of longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg.

How has Trump responded? In a statement yesterday, the Trump Organization denounced the verdict, which could carry a fine of up to $1.6m, a relatively negligible sum for such a large company though it could affect future business dealings. A lawyer for the Trump Organization vowed to appeal.

German police raids target far-right extremists ‘seeking to overthrow state’

Twenty-five people including a 71-year-old German aristocrat, a retired military commander and former MP for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) have been detained in Germany on suspicion of a terrorist plan to overthrow the state and re-negotiate the country’s post-second world war settlement.

Thousands of police carried out a series of raids across Germany on Wednesday morning in connection with the far-right ring.

Federal prosecutors said 3,000 officers had conducted searches at 130 sites in 11 of Germany’s 16 states against the group, whose members it said adhered to a “conglomerate of conspiracy theories” including the QAnon cult and the so-called Reich Citizens movement.

Prosecutors said 22 German citizens had been detained on suspicion of “membership in a terrorist organisation”. Three other detainees, including a female Russian citizen, were suspected of supporting the organisation, they said.

Who is behind the ring? German media have identified as the group’s ringleaders as Heinrich XIII, 71, a descendant of the noble Reuß family that used to rule over parts of eastern Germany in the 12th century, and a former senior field officer at the German army’s paratrooper battalion named only as Rüdiger von P.

World Cup 2022: A beautiful day for Morocco as the quarter-final ties are set

The round of 16 in Qatar had progressed smoothly and with a distinct lack of upsets until Tuesday. That all changed when Morocco knocked out 2010 champions Spain in a penalty shootout, in which the visibly nervous Spanish players failed to convert a single kick. Spain are making a habit of this: they went out at this stage in the last World Cup on penalties, too. Morocco are only the fourth African team to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup and the first since Ghana in 2010. Their fans were understandably ecstatic.

The day’s other game was slightly less tense as Portugal thrashed Switzerland 6-1. It was a formidable performance from the Portuguese and all the more remarkable given that Cristiano Ronaldo, who has dominated the team for nearly two decades, was benched before the game. How did his replacement, 21-year-old Gonçalo Ramos, fare? He scored a brilliant hat-trick.

Elsewhere at the World Cup

There are two soccer-free days in Qatar now before the quarter-finals, which take place on Friday and Saturday. First up on Friday is Croatia v Brazil (10am ET) followed by Netherlands v Argentina (2pm ET). Saturday’s first game is Morocco v Portugal (10am) before England v France (2pm ET) rounds things off.

Stat of the day: Is Facebook losing its $100bn gamble on virtual reality?

Meta has spent staggering amounts on creating an immersive successor to the traditional 2D internet. But what has it got to show for it, apart from 11,000 job losses? Composite: Guardian Design/AFP/Getty/Reuters

What a difference a year makes. Last October, Facebook supremo Mark Zuckerberg could barely wait to show the world what he was up to as he guided us through his vision for the virtual-reality future. This month, we saw a more subdued Zuckerberg on display: “I wanna say upfront that I take full responsibility for this decision,” he told employees morosely. Meta was laying off 11,000 people – 13% of its workforce. After poor third-quarter results Meta’s share price dropped by 25%, wiping $80bn off the company’s value. Reality Labs, Meta’s metaverse division, has lost $3.7bn in the past three months, with worse expected to come.

Don’t miss this: Kirstie Alley was celebrated not because she was flawless – but because her flaws were so visible

Kirstie Alley was so widely celebrated not because she was flawless but because her flaws were so visible, writes Veronica Esposito – she was among those celebrities who are compelling because they eschew the carefully managed image of the famous in favour of offering something that feels completely unfiltered and thus far more intimate. Alley achieved prominence at a time when actors such as Roseanne Barr and Rosie O’Donnell courted controversy in large part by defying sexist expectations of how a female celebrity should come off in public life, and how she should portray characters in film and TV.

Humanity has become a weapon of mass extinction and governments must end the “orgy of destruction”, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said at the beginning of the biodiversity Cop15. “We are out of harmony with nature. In fact, we are playing an entirely different song. Around the world, for hundreds of years, we have conducted a cacophony of chaos, played with instruments of destruction. Deforestation and desertification are creating wastelands of once-thriving ecosystems,” he said.

158,Suspended New Orleans deacon pleads guilty to molesting preteen boy,"The clerical molestation scandal that for decades has engulfed the Roman Catholic church in New Orleans took another turn on Tuesday, when a suspended deacon pleaded guilty to charges that he sexually abused a preteen boy two decades earlier, before the defendant’s ordination as a clergy member.

Virgil Maxey “VM” Wheeler III, 64, pleaded guilty to four charges of indecent behavior with a juvenile filed against him in state court in Jefferson parish, which neighbors New Orleans. He agreed to serve five years of probation in exchange for that plea, avoid contact with the victim for the rest of his life and register as a sex offender for 15 years, court records show.

Meanwhile, prosecutors dismissed charges of sexual battery of a child younger than 13 that they had initially leveled against him. The dismissed charges could have carried 10 years in prison if he had been convicted, based on Louisiana law in effect at the time of the admitted abuse.

Court documents spelling out Wheeler’s plea noted that the abuse occurred between 2000 and 2002.

Despite Tuesday’s plea, Wheeler is still facing a civil lawsuit demanding damages for his now acknowledged victim.

That suit claims – among other assertions – that prominent local Catholics unsuccessfully mounted a pressure campaign to get the victim to abandon his allegations against Wheeler, who was also a well-known attorney in the area, including an offer of $400,000 for the victim to stop cooperating with law enforcement officials.

Wheeler was once friends with the family of his accuser, whose identity is known but has not been published in news reports because media outlets do not name victims of sexual abuse without their permission.

The unresolved civil lawsuit alleges that the victim’s mother – knowing Wheeler dreamed of becoming a deacon – had reported to local church officials years ago that Wheeler had tried to coax the victim and the victim’s brother into bed during a ski trip when the victim was 12.

Nonetheless, church officials have maintained that the victim did not fully disclose details of his abuse at the hands of Wheeler until the summer of 2020. The New Orleans church by then had ordained Wheeler as one of its deacons, who are similar to priests, though they can join the clergy despite being married.

But the victim’s report against Wheeler prompted New Orleans’s archbishop, Gregory Aymond, to suspend Wheeler from his work as a deacon at a church in a suburban part of the city. Prosecutors in Jefferson parish charged Wheeler late last year. He declared himself not guilty at first but reversed himself Tuesday.

The victim on Tuesday read a statement in court that in part discussed how his pursuit of justice demonstrated how “you can turn pain into power”.

It wasn’t immediately clear whether the New Orleans archdiocese would add Wheeler to a list of clerics who have worked – or were ordained – locally and have been credibly accused of sexually abusing minors or vulnerable adults.

Aymond’s initial release of that list in 2018 – the same year as Wheeler’s ordination – led to a wave of lawsuits against the church, which has since filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The list’s release was meant as an act of transparency aimed at parishioners who had lost faith amid new revelations at the time linked to the global church’s clerical abuse crisis, dating back decades.

Last week, the Guardian was first to report that one of the claims filed as part of the bankruptcy case was from a former New Orleans seminarian who in the 1990s alleged that he was harassed at a local college which trains priests, including by Aymond, who was the school’s rector at the time. Aymond vehemently denies the claim.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/new-orleans-deacon-pleads-guilty-molesting-boy-catholic,2022-12-06T00:00:00
159,Colorado suspect charged with 305 counts over deadly gay club shooting,"The suspect accused of entering a Colorado gay nightclub clad in body armor and opening fire with an AR-15-style rifle, killing five people and wounding 17 others, was charged by prosecutors on Tuesday with 305 criminal counts including hate crimes and murder.

Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, sat upright in a chair during the hearing and appeared alert. In an earlier court appearance just a few days after the shooting, the defendant’s head and face were covered with bruises and Aldrich was slumped over and had to be prompted by attorneys to respond to questions from a judge.

Investigators said Aldrich entered Club Q, a sanctuary for the LGBTQ community in the mostly conservative city of Colorado Springs, just before midnight on 19 November and began shooting during a drag queen’s birthday celebration. The killing stopped after patrons wrestled the suspect to the ground, beating Aldrich into submission, they said.

Aldrich had been held on hate crime charges but prosecutors had said previously they were not sure if those counts would stick because they needed to assess if there was adequate evidence to show it was a bias-motivated crime.

District attorney Michael Allen had noted that murder charges would carry the harshest penalty – probably life in prison – but also said it was important to show the community that bias-motivated crimes are not tolerated if there was evidence to support the charge.

Allen did not detail the charges in Tuesday’s hearing but said they included “many counts of bias-motivated crimes”. He declined at a later news conference to discuss what evidence prosecutors found to back the hate crimes charges.

“We are not going to tolerate actions against community members based on their sexual identity,” Allen said. “Members of that community have been harassed, intimidated and abused for too long.”

Judge Michael McHenry ordered the arrest warrant affidavit in the case to be unsealed on Wednesday, over the objections of Aldrich’s attorney who said he was concerned about the defendant’s right to a fair trial due to publicity surrounding the case.

Aldrich, who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns according to defense court filings, was arrested at the club by police. They have not entered a plea or spoken about the events.

Allen said the suspect being nonbinary was “part of the picture” in considering hate crime charges but he would not elaborate.

Experts say someone who is nonbinary can be charged with a hate crime for targeting fellow members of the same group because hate crime laws are focused on the victims, not the perpetrator. But bringing a hate crime case to conviction can be difficult, because prosecutors must prove what motivated the defendant, a higher standard than usually required in court.

Colorado prosecutors will need concrete evidence such as statements Aldrich may have made about the shooting, Frank Pezzella, an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said.

“It’s got to be more than he shot up Club Q,” he said.

According to witnesses, Aldrich fired first at people gathered at the club’s bar before spraying bullets across the dancefloor during the attack, which came on the eve of an annual day of remembrance for transgender people lost to violence.

More than a year before the shooting, Aldrich was arrested on allegations of making a bomb threat that led to the evacuation of about 10 homes. Aldrich threatened to harm their own family with a homemade bomb, ammunition and multiple weapons, authorities said at the time. Aldrich was booked into jail on suspicion of felony menacing and kidnapping, but the case was apparently later sealed and it’s unclear what became of the charges. There are no public indications that the case led to a conviction.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/colorado-springs-club-q-shooting-suspect-charged,2022-12-06T00:00:00
160,January 6 officers and relatives snub top Republicans at gold medal ceremony,"Senior Republicans Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy were snubbed by law enforcement leaders and a fallen officer’s family at Tuesday’s Congressional Gold Medal award ceremony for Capitol police who defended against the 6 January attacks.

The pair were denounced as “two-faced” by the mother of Officer Brian Sicknick, who died after a mob of Donald Trump supporters ransacked the Capitol building and forced politicians to flee for their lives.

McConnell, the Senate minority leader, was caught on video with his hand outstretched, waiting in line for handshakes that never came as senior officers and Sicknick’s parents warmly greeted the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer.

The relatives and officers in uniform then walked straight past the Republican duo, barely looking at them.

“They’re just two-faced. I’m just tired of them standing there and saying how wonderful the Capitol police is, and they turn around and … go down to Mar-a-Lago and kiss [Trump’s] ring,” Sicknick’s mother, Gladys Sicknick, said, according to a tweet by CNN congressional reporter Daniella Diaz.

“It just hurts.”

Sicknick’s brother, Ken, was also forthright. “They have no idea what integrity is. They can’t stand up for what’s right and wrong,” he said.

McCarthy, who hopes to become speaker when Republicans take over the House majority next month, was widely condemned for what analysts said was a pilgrimage to Trump’s Florida resort in the days after the insurrection.

After initially saying he held the outgoing president responsible for the violence of his supporters, McCarthy worked hard to regain Trump’s trust, and has promised he will investigate the January 6 bipartisan House panel who are looking into the events of that day.

McConnell, similarly, has been criticized for not standing up to Trump.

The book Unchecked, published in September by Rachael Bade of Politico and Karoun Demirjian of the Washington Post, claimed McConnell called Trump “crazy” and vowed never to speak to him again after 6 January.

But like McCarthy before him, McConnell has backed away from his original stance, and in April said he would support Trump again if he ran for the presidency. Trump announced his 2024 candidacy last month.

Michael Fanone, a DC Metropolitan Police officer beaten and injured in the attack, has previously branded McCarthy “a weasel” for actions and words after the riot. Fanone attended Tuesday’s ceremony, but says he was heckled by some former colleagues.

“They called me a piece of shit and mockingly called me a great fucking hero while clapping,” Fanone said, according to an NBC justice reporter, Ryan Reilly.

Before the snub, McCarthy said that “days like today force us to realize how much we owe the thin blue line”.

Fanone, who has since retired, was not impressed. “I’m surprised Kevin McCarthy showed up. I thought that he would be busy trying to figure out how to suspend the constitution on behalf of former president Trump,” he told CNN.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/congressional-gold-medal-mcconnell-mccarthy-snubbed-capitol-police,2022-12-06T00:00:00
161,US McDonald’s franchisees fined for making children work excessive hours,"The owners of several McDonald’s restaurants in Pennsylvania have been accused of violating child labor laws, with more than 100 children allegedly working excessive hours.

The US labor department announced on Monday that 13 McDonald’s locations in the Pittsburgh area had violated labor laws designed to protect young employees. An investigation found that 101 child employees had been working excessive hours outside allowable time periods.

The McDonald’s restaurants had been owned by John and Kathleen Santonastasso, who operate Santonastasso Enterprises, based in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania, close to Pittsburgh.

The investigation found that 14- and 15-year-olds worked more than three hours a day or more than 18 hours a week during the school week. Minors were also working past 7pm on a school night and past 9pm during summer vacation, both of which are also violations.

“Permitting young workers to work excessive hours can jeopardize their safety, wellbeing and education,” the labor department’s wage and hour district director, John DuMont, said. “Employers who hire young workers must understand and comply with federal child labor laws or face costly consequences.”

In another McDonald’s eatery also operated by Santonastasso, a 16-year-old was allowed to operate a deep fryer that did not have a device to automatically raise and lower baskets.

The Santonastassos were ordered to pay a civil penalty of $57,332.

The Santonastassos told the Washington Post that they were addressing scheduling issues in regards to child labor violations.

“We take our role as a local employer very seriously and we regret any scheduling issues that may have occurred at our restaurants,” John and Kathleen Santonastasso said in a statement.

A separate child labor investigation from earlier this month found that a Nebraska sanitation allegedly employed 31 children in job duties that are illegal for those under 18.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/06/mcdonalds-pennsylvania-franchisees-fined-excessive-hours,2022-12-06T00:00:00
162,Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak agree to increase gas exports from US to UK,"Joe Biden has agreed a deal to ramp up gas exports from the US to the UK as part of a joint effort to cut bills and limit Russia’s impact on western energy supplies.

Sunak and Biden announced an “energy security and affordability partnership” and set up a joint action group, led by Westminster and White House officials, with the aim of reducing global dependence on Russian energy.

Britain was not reliant on large quantities of Russian gas before the invasion of Ukraine but has been exposed to the huge rises in prices as European neighbours competed for other supplies as they rushed to fill up storage facilities.

Under the deal, the US aims to more than double the amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exported to the UK over the coming year, compared with 2021.

The two countries also intend to collaborate on accelerating green initiatives such as decarbonising the aerospace industry, boosting the electric vehicle market and developing energy efficient appliances. They also plan to further collaborate on nuclear, hydrogen and carbon capture projects.

Sunak said: “Together the UK and US will ensure the global price of energy and the security of our national supply can never again be manipulated by the whims of a failing regime.”

Britain has proved a key gateway for LNG imports and re-exports into Europe this year. However, its lack of gas storage facilities has meant it could still face tight energy supplies this winter.

The government said that, as part of the gas deal, the US will “strive” to export at least 9-10bn cubic metres (bcm) of LNG over the next year via UK terminals.

The deal has been rumoured for months and industry watchers have questioned how big a gas boost it represents. Data from ship-tracking service ICIS LNG Edge showed the UK imported 3.9bcm of LNG from the US in 2021, 26% of the UK’s total LNG imports.

Over the 12 months to October 2022, the UK imported 9.7bcm of American LNG, 42% of total imports.

Biden and Sunak said in a joint statement: “During this global energy crisis, brought on by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, it is more important than ever for allied countries to deepen their cooperation to ensure resilient international systems which reflect our shared values.

“Working with our allies, the United States and United Kingdom commit to intensify our collaboration to support international energy security, affordability, and sustainability, as Europe reduces its dependence on Russian energy.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/07/joe-biden-and-rishi-sunak-agree-to-increase-gas-exports-from-us-to-uk,2022-12-07T00:00:00
163,Honduras partially suspends constitutional rights to tackle gangs,"Authorities in Honduras will partially suspend constitutional rights as part of an effort to combat an apparent rise in extortion, raising fears of human rights violations and warnings of creeping authoritarianism in Central America.

Under the plan, which will come into effect late on Tuesday and will be in effect for at least 30 days, thousands of security forces will be deployed to 162 gang-infested neighborhoods in the country’s two largest cities, San Pedro Sula and the capital, Tegucigalpa.

“[Extortion] is one of the main causes of insecurity, migration, displacement, loss of freedom, violent deaths and the closure of small and medium-sized businesses,” said Xiomara Castro, the president, while announcing the plan on 1 December. “With the comprehensive strategy against extortion and related crimes announced today by the national police, this government of democratic socialism declares war on extortion.”

Castro’s announcement immediately drew comparisons with the hardline policies of neighbouring El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele has partially suspended constitutional rights for the last eight months during an unprecedented crackdown on gangs that has resulted in more than 55,000 arrests and a slew of alleged human rights violations.

Experts doubt that Castro’s government will take measures to the same extreme as its Salvadoran counterpart. “I really struggle to see them going as far as Bukele,” said Tiziano Breda, a Central America security analyst for the International Crisis Group, who listed three main reasons for his conclusion. First, widespread human rights violations would threaten to alienate a key faction of the coalition that brought Castro and her center-left Libre party to power just one year ago. Second, although El Salvador is a smaller country in both territory and population, it has more military and police officers as well as prison capacity. Finally, Castro’s party has not yet taken control of the judicial branch, whose compliance would be essential.

Human rights activists are nonetheless concerned that the partial suspension of constitutional rights could result in the kinds of abuses alleged to have taken place in El Salvador, including arbitrary detentions of innocent people, excessive use of force and torture.

“Instead of generating positive expectations, it generates enormous worry,” said Ismael Moreno, a leading human rights activist in Honduras, who noted the grim record of Honduran security forces and the lack of accountability that they have historically been subjected to.

Equally worrisome for Moreno is the number of people calling for such hardline policies in Honduras. “The government is going to find popular support, without a doubt, and that is very worrying because we can move towards regimes like the one in El Salvador or others that are sustained by force, that are sustained by threats and are sustained by the irresponsible application of the law,” he said.

The decision to suspend constitutional guarantees and deploy thousands of police and military forces in troubled neighborhoods has overshadowed other, more pragmatic measures at the heart of the Honduran government’s plan to combat extortion, which experts such as Breda believe are more likely to have a long-term impact.

This includes a series of legal reforms and resource upgrades aimed at dismantling gang leadership structures and attacking their money-laundering activities as opposed to simply capturing the foot soldiers who collect extortion payments and are easily replaced.

With some of Honduras’s most crime-ridden cities left out of the decree, the possibility exists that more neighbourhoods could be added in the future, as well as that the duration could be extended beyond the original 30 days.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/honduras-partially-suspends-constitutional-rights-extortion,2022-12-06T00:00:00
164,Harry and Meghan win racial justice and mental health award,"A US human rights charity has awarded Harry and Meghan its Ripple of Hope award for their activism on racial justice and mental health.

In a statement celebrating their award, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said “a ripple of hope can turn into a wave of change”. The couple received the award on Tuesday night in New York, two days before the release of a tell-all Netflix show expected to include damning revelations about the royal family.

In a trailer for the show, Harry speaks of a “hierarchy in the family”, a “dirty game”, and says: “We know the full truth”.



The Robert F Kennedy Human Rights organisation (RFKHR) hands out the annual accolade to leaders in government, business, activism and entertainment, this year also honouring Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Bank of America president, Brian Moynihan, among others.



During the ceremony, the couple announced they would be collaborating with the RFKHR on a new award recognising gender equity in student film, which they said they hoped would “inspire a new generation of leadership in the arts, where diverse up and coming talent have a platform to have their voices heard and their stories told”.



According to the RFKHR, honourees are those who have demonstrated “an unwavering commitment to social change and worked to protect and advance equity, justice, and human rights”.

The award is named after the “ripple of hope” speech on apartheid given in 1966 given by Robert Kennedy, the former US president John F Kennedy’s brother, to students at Cape Town University in South Africa. The charity was set up shortly after Robert Kennedy was murdered in 1968.



His daughter, Kerry Kennedy, a human rights lawyer and the charity’s president, said the Sussexes had been “incredibly brave” in addressing the issues of racial justice and mental illness.



“They’ve stood up, they’ve talked about racial justice and they’ve talked about mental illness in a way that was incredibly brave,” she told the US news outlet Extra.



“In this world in the wake of Covid there has been a massive spike … people around the globe have said they have anxiety and massive depression. For Meghan to get out there on national television and normalise discussion of mental health, at this point, is incredibly important and very brave.”



The 2022 Ripple of Hope ceremony was hosted by the Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin.

The ceremony also recognised the former NBA basketball star and civil rights campaigner Bill Russell with a posthumous award.



Previous Ripple of Hope winners have included the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, the poet Amanda Gorman, the US’s chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, musicians Bono and Taylor Swift, the South African bishop and activist Desmond Tutu, actor George Clooney, former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and the Apple CEO Tim Cook.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/07/harry-and-meghan-win-racial-justice-and-mental-health-award,2022-12-07T00:00:00
165,Canada: unidentified victim of alleged serial killer given name Buffalo Woman,"The unidentified victim of an alleged serial killer in Canada has been given the name Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe, or Buffalo Woman, by grieving community members, amid growing fears that a woman who is believed to be Indigenous would remain nameless.

Last week, Winnipeg police charged Jeremy Skibicki in the deaths of three women. Two were named as Morgan Harris, 39, and Marcedes Myran, 26 of Long Plain First Nation, but the third woman has not been identified. Skibick had previously been charged in May in the killing of 24-year-old Rebecca Contois of O-Chi-Chak-Ko-Sipi First Nation.

Police had canvassed the city in a bid to identify the fourth victim, they have made little progress.

“We don’t want somebody to be known as unidentified. For us, a life is sacred and we have to honour that,” Bernadette Smith, a provincial lawmaker whose sister Claudette Osborne, went missing 12 years ago, said at a vigil for the murdered women on Sunday evening. “When you go into a ceremony and you’re seeking a name, Buffalo Woman is often the name you’re given until they find your name.”

“The buffalo represents respect, and our people need to be respected, and the men out there need to respect our women,” Delores Daniels told the crowd gathered in the snow. In 2017, her 19-year-old daughter Serena McKay was killed on Sagkeeng First Nation and said Buffalo Woman was the spirit name given to her daughter.

Police said on Monday they would begin using the name Buffalo Woman – Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe – “as a sign of respect” from community members including knowledge keepers and Elders.

The police also said they were meeting with family representatives and Indigenous leadership and would not comment on the cases until those meetings are done.

Little is known Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe, who police said was living in Winnipeg and is believed to be in her mid-20s.

Police uncovered Contois’s remains earlier in the year, but none of the other women’s bodies have been located. They are believed to have been killed between March and May 2022. Winnipeg police chief Danny Smyth told reporters they were probably taken to the the city’s Brady Landfill, where Contois’s remains were found, but believes too much time has passed for police to uncover any new evidence.

166,Taiwan foreign minister: China may scapegoat us over Covid protests,"Taiwan’s foreign minister has backed China’s anti-Covid protesters but also expressed concerns that Beijing could seek to scapegoat Taiwan if demonstrations restarted.

Joseph Wu said Taiwan stood alongside other democracies in calling for China to “respect basic human rights” regarding the extraordinary protests that spread across China last week and the swift police response to close in on those involved.

“When the people’s livelihood is restricted or people’s lives are made inconvenient because of the government policies, I think it is the right for the people to stand up and say that they demand some basic rights,” Wu told the Guardian in an exclusive interview.

“Freedom of expression, freedom of speech, is a basic right, and we certainly hope the Chinese government will observe that kind of basic right.”

However, Wu said Taiwan had paid “close attention” to the rallies to see how they would “evolve” and expressed an “additional concern” that they could restart.

“We are always concerned that the Chinese government might try to create an external crisis to divert domestic attention,” said Wu. “We are concerned that the Chinese government will aim at Taiwan, will accuse Taiwan of being the cause for the unrest in China.

“The government seems to be willing to moderate some of its measures,” said Wu. “So in the future, these might cause more demonstrations among the Chinese people because they think that when there are major grievances, this is probably a very effective way of changing the government policy.”

Last week saw some specific mentions of Taiwan amid claims of foreign involvement in China’s protests, but none from official Chinese voices. One communication from a residential building manager in Guangzhou, seen by the Guardian, blamed the unrest of American and Taiwanese “trolls”, and there were sporadic mentions on social media, suggesting some acceptance of the claim.

Communist party (CCP) disinformation campaigns and cognitive warfare are a major element of Beijing’s attempts to destabilise Taiwanese government and society, and are of increasing concern to the island’s government.

There is no evidence the protests have been incited by foreign forces. The accusation was ridiculed by protesters attending at least one rally, with a widely shared clip showing a man questioning how they could be communicating with foreign forces when they could not connect to foreign internet services.

China’s government appears to have largely shut down the protests, the most significant acts of protest there since the Tiananmen rallies in 1989, which were brutally crushed by the military. Authorities have offered a carrot-and-stick response of eased restrictions for the broader population alongside a police crackdown on protesters and citizens with illegal VPNs and messaging apps.

Major cities have lifted restrictions, reduced testing requirements, and the government has shifted its official messaging to emphasise the lower severity of Omicron. However there are concerns about the large outbreak of Covid-19 that could be yet to come, if China’s trajectory follows that of other countries that abandoned zero-Covid.

Taiwan also operated what was essentially a zero-Covid response for most of the pandemic. It did not impose lockdowns, but maintained closed borders and strict quarantine requirements for positive cases and their contacts, with the aim of eliminating outbreaks. Its success kept death rates low, but also meant there was very little natural immunity when a “tsunami” of the highly transmissible Omicron variant hit. Like China’s now, Taiwan’s elderly population was also vastly undervaccinated, and many died when the virus spread.

Asked what advice Taiwan could offer China, Wu said going through the first wave was “not easy”. He noted China’s poor vaccination rates and the lower effectiveness of China’s domestically produced vaccines.

“Under these kinds of circumstances, the Chinese government, in my opinion, is caught in a dilemma,” he said, but advised China against returning to lockdowns.

“On the one hand, they understand that the lockdowns will cause their economic slowdown and inconveniences of the people, and may cause resentment of the regular Chinese people. But on the other hand, if they open up without proper vaccines to fight regular people, they are going to be caught in a major disease crisis.”

167,Thousands take to streets in Greece in protest over 2008 shooting of teenager,"Thousands of people have joined protests in Athens, Thessaloniki and other Greek cities to commemorate the fatal police shooting of a teenager, hours after violence erupted over a similar incident in the north of the country.

Police estimated more than 11,000 protesters had joined protests on Tuesday amid fears of renewed clashes as a Romany boy, shot in the head by an officer, fought for his life.

“Stop these murderous policies,” chanted protesters. More than 4,000 law enforcement personnel, backed by heavily armed riot police, were dispatched around Athens.

The victim, identified as Kostas Frangoulis, 16, a member of the Roma community in Thessaloniki, was severely wounded as he was pursued by a mechanised police division after allegedly failing to pay a €20 (£17) fuel bill at a petrol station.

The incident came on the eve of the anniversary of the death of Alexis Grigoropoulos – a teenager killed in 2008 by an officer in Athens’ Exarchia district – and once again cast a spotlight on the tactics of a police force frequently criticised for its heavy-handedness and brutality. The controversial circumstances of Grigoropoulos’s death unleashed the worst riots in decades nationwide.

In a statement, the main opposition leftwing Syriza party said: “History is repeating itself not as farce but as tragedy as a result of police immunity and blatant arbitrariness.”

Earlier on Tuesday hundreds of Roma gathered outside a court complex in Greece’s second-biggest city as a 34-year-old officer, who admitted firing his service pistol during the chase, appeared before a prosecutor on charges of attempted manslaughter with possible intent.

A police statement said that before the shooting the youth had attempted to “ram police motorbikes” and “repeatedly made dangerous manoeuvres”.

In Athens and Thessaloniki, incensed protesters took to the streets late on Monday with banners stating the teenager had been deliberately targeted by police because he was a member of a discriminated minority.

In echoes of the unrest that followed the shooting of Grigoropoulos, violence erupted as leftwing and anarchist groups vented their anger, smashing shop windows and hurling rocks and molotov cocktails at police, who retaliated with teargas and stun grenades.

In recent years a number of Romany men have been fatally shot or injured in similar chases by police. “It was a murderous attack against a member of a discriminated minority,” said Yiannis Baroutsas, a young student, as he marched through the capital with protesters on Tuesday. “The police have a culture of brutality in this country. They use guns against Roma and stun grenades against us.”

Graffiti daubed on public buildings across Athens after Monday’s incident proclaimed: “It wasn’t the gas, it wasn’t money, the cops fired because he was Roma.”

The government of the centre-right prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has taken what has been described as a draconian approach to law and order with refugees in particular being especially effected by the harsh policies.

The Greek leader, hoping for re-election next year, was heavily criticised on Tuesday for electing to announce a €600 bonus for police and coastguard officials on the very day that Frangoulis had been shot. “A lot of us see it as proof that this government condones the tactics of the police,” said Baroutsas, eliciting nods of consent from others on the march. “Couldn’t he have announced the bonus on another day?”

A lawyer representing the Frangoulis family described the teenager’s life as “hanging by a thread”, as fury over the incident ran high among Greece’s Roma population.

“We don’t want Kostas to become another Alexis,” said the lawyer, Theofilos Alexopoulos. “We want him to make it and to be the cause that will enable us to put all the issues concerning the Roma on the table again.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/thousands-of-police-on-street-in-athens-amid-protest-over-2008-shooting,2022-12-06T00:00:00
168,Saudi Arabia readies full state pageantry for Xi Jinping visit,"Xi Jinping will arrive in Riyadh on Wednesday on a long awaited visit to a regional ally that has readied full state pageantry and a round of agreements likely to cement ties between China and Saudi Arabia – and deepen alarm in Washington.

China’s president will meet more than 30 heads of state and business leaders during his three-day visit to the Saudi capital, which is set to lead to a “strategic agreement” between the authoritarian powers. The trip is the culmination of decades of cooperation once based on oil sales, which has grown into bilateral trade of close to $90bn a year.

The reception that awaits Xi is on a scale of that afforded to Donald Trump during the early months of his administration and is in stark contrast to the low key and largely fruitless visit of his successor, Joe Biden, to Jeddah in August.

Biden had arrived in Saudi Arabia seeking assurances over global oil prices, which the kingdom had refused to help lower by cutting supply. He left empty handed and with bedrock ties between the two allies under serious challenge, as Riyadh appeared to support Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.

Saudi Arabia and Gulf states have been deepening ties with Russia and China over recent years as they question the security partnership that had underpinned relationships over recent decades. The UAE has been particularly aggrieved by what it sees as Washington’s lack of support for attacks on its capital earlier this year by Houthi forces in Yemen, and for the 2017 offensive it co-launched with Riyadh against Houthi groups.

Both sides see a US restriction on arms sales as undermining Washington’s traditional role as underwriter of its security needs.

The kingdom has been rattled by a lack of US response to attacks by Shia militias against its main refinery. The country’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, meanwhile, was angered by Biden’s vow at the outset of his administration to consider him a pariah, after US intelligence agencies concluded that he ordered the assassination of dissident Jamal Khashoggi.

Prince Mohammed’s allies did little to hide their delight after Biden failed to persuade the Crown Prince to open oil pipes and help decrease prices before US midterm elections. On that same trip, Biden pledged that the US would not lose influence to China in the Middle East. “We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia, or Iran,” he said

The contrast to Xi’s reception, however, could not be more marked. China and Saudi Arabia’s already lucrative deals across the technology, industrial, petrochemical and weapons sectors are likely to be significantly expanded, anchoring Beijing’s aegis at a time that the US has repivoted towards security threats in Asia and the war in Ukraine.

The visit offers the most visible platform yet for Riyadh to showcase its pulling power as a trade partner and emerging presence as a global voice to be reckoned with. Beijing is already Riyadh’s biggest trading partner and Saudi Arabia is a member of the belt and road global infrastructure plan.

“We have said for a long time that there are more people to dine with than Washington,” said a senior Saudi official. “That message will be very clear when this visit gets under way. The Chinese do not lecture and they don’t disrespect. They know how to do business.

“The Americans on the other hand have wanted us to choose sides. We will not.”

The US has been unsettled by what it sees as China and Saudi Arabia’s direct support for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. Russia has increased efforts to sell discounted oil to Beijing at a time when it faces crippling western sanctions. Beijing remains heavily dependent on oil for its energy demands and has made no secret of its intent to consolidate energy and political ties with the GCC.

Before the visit, Chinese flags were being hung across Riyadh and in ceremonial halls where Xi will be received. Gulf leaders and business figures were expected to arrive on Wednesday, with many receiving hurried invitations earlier this week.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/saudi-arabia-readies-full-state-pageantry-for-xi-jinping-visit,2022-12-07T00:00:00
169,Russian TV station in Latvia loses licence over Ukraine war coverage,"Latvia has revoked a broadcast licence for TV Rain, the independent Russian TV station broadcasting from exile, following a scandal over its coverage of the war in Ukraine.

The liberal television station relocated to Riga, the Latvian capital, as well as Tbilisi and Amsterdam shortly after Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

TV Rain’s website had been blocked by Russian regulators and its journalists feared they would face criminal charges for speaking out against the war and under new laws for “discrediting the Russian army”.

On Tuesday, Latvia became the second country this year to cut TV Rain’s broadcasts, saying the decision was taken “in connection with threats to national security and public order”. TV Rain called the accusations against the channel “unfair and absurd”.

The decision followed on-air remarks by an anchor who said that he hoped the station’s reports on abuses and mismanagement by the Russian state during Moscow’s mass mobilisation drive “were able to help many servicemen, including, for example, with equipment and just basic amenities at the front”.

The statements were taken as proof that the television channel sympathised with the Russian military, which the anchor had called “our army”, and had even provided equipment to the armed forces itself.

Tikhon Dzyadko, the station’s editor-in-chief, soon clarified the station was not providing any aid to the Russian army and that the journalist misspoke. The station also fired the anchor.

Nonetheless, the damage had been done. On Tuesday, Latvia’s National Electronic Media Council (NEPLP), a media regulator, said the station had committed several violations of its standards and would also be cut off from broadcasting on Latvian television on 8 December.

The channel had also been charged with failing to provide Latvian subtitles in its coverage and for having displayed a map that showed Crimea, the peninsula occupied by Russian forces in 2014, as part of Russia. It is recognised internationally as part of Ukraine.

The regulator also said it “was convinced that the management of TV Rain did not understand the nature and gravity of each individual infringement, nor of any set of infringements”.

“The laws of Latvia must be respected by everyone,” tweeted Ivars Abolins, chairman of the NEPLP.

The furore over the TV station, which has produced critical reporting of the Russian government for more than a decade, provides a vivid illustration of distrust of the Russian opposition and opponents of the war in exile.

Latvia’s state security service announced an investigation into TV Rain last week, saying it “has repeatedly alerted the decision-makers about the various risks emanating from Russia’s so-called independent media relocating their activity to Latvia”.

A number of prominent European figures have spoken out in support of TV Rain, noting that the TV station is one of few homegrown media outlets capable of reaching Russians with an anti-war message.

“It’s war, and emotions are running high, but the wisdom of this decision eludes me. It will mightily please the Kremlin and be used by them,” wrote Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “I hope TV Rain can find a new home and continue its important mission.”

The Russian government appeared gleeful at the decision, saying it showed that freedom of speech in Europe was an “illusion”.

“Some always think that it’s better somewhere else than at home,” said Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman. “And some always think that it’s freedom somewhere else and it’s unfreedom at home. This is a vivid example demonstrating how erroneous such illusions are.”

The TV station vowed to fight on, saying it would continue to broadcast online while seeking a longer term solution.

“Don’t bury us too soon,” wrote one journalist who had worked with the channel. “We are working. We are managing it.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/rain-russian-tv-station-in-latvia-loses-licence-over-ukraine-war-coverage,2022-12-06T00:00:00
170,‘We’re doubling down’: how abortion advocates are building on midterm wins,"Renee Bracey Sherman answers the phone and apologizes – is it OK if we speak while she drives? Like many abortion advocates, she tends to keep a packed schedule and talk at lightning speed – the next initiative, the next law, the next policy on the horizon. Ask advocates how they felt in June after the Dobbs decision sharply curtailed reproductive rights across the US, or in November after wins in the midterm elections signaled strong public support for abortion, and they’ll answer immediately: We knew this was coming; but the fight’s not over.

What Bracey Sherman – founder and executive director of We Testify, a group focused on the leadership and representation of people who have abortions – and her colleagues in the pro-choice movement don’t spend much time doing is elaborating on the past, or how they mourned or celebrated, because it’s already in the rear-view window. Their eyes are laser-focused on the future.

“We’re doubling down,” Bracey Sherman said.

Abortion was a central issue in a midterm election that saw Democrats retain the Senate and relinquish only a narrow majority in the House. In Kentucky and Montana, voters rejected anti-abortion initiatives on the ballot; and in Michigan, California and Vermont, voters chose to establish reproductive rights in state law. Over the summer, Kansas voters similarly rejected a ballot measure to remove abortion rights from its constitution.

“When abortion was on the ballot, it won, so that was fantastic,” said Elisa Wells, co-founder and co-director of Plan C, an organization that helps access abortion medication. Those wins “really demonstrate that legislators are out of touch with what the majority of Americans want. They support abortion access, and understand that it’s basic, common medical care.”

So pro-choice advocates are taking the fight to new areas, principally access to abortion care, which is now heavily restricted in many places, and support for abortion seekers in states that have criminalized it.

The focus is squarely on the states. For the next two years, with Congress divided, it’s understood that little will get done at the federal level.

“The state level is probably where abortion rights advocates will need to work, and have had some success in the last year,” said Shana Kushner Gadarian, professor of political science at Syracuse University.

Ballot initiatives were one of those real successes. It’s important for organizers “to get things directly in front of voters, because they seem to be winning on that side”, she said.

They were successful in two ways. First, reproductive health can be an issue that stretches across partisan lines, with Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike voicing some level of support for abortion – especially when it comes to opposition to total abortion bans.

But the Dobbs decision also drove a surge in voter registration, especially for Democrats, and it made abortion rights a more salient voting issue, even beyond ballot initiatives, Gadarian noted.

That translated into results. Voters opposed anti-abortion candidates in several states: Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin elected Democratic governors who could veto anti-abortion legislation, while Republicans in Arizona, North Carolina and Wisconsin failed to reach a supermajority in both the state senate and house, making it impossible to override such a veto.

That’s a strong message to candidates in future elections. “Politicians care about re-election,” Gadarian said. “They want to make sure that they’re not going so far ahead of the public that they are going to get punished during the next election cycle.” That could mean instituting less-encompassing laws in conservative states, such as Florida’s 15-week restrictions, she said.

Anti-abortion advocates went too far by creating state-level bans, which are extremely unpopular, and even pushing for a nationwide ban, said Bracey Sherman. “They overplayed their hand on everything.” There was also an unprecedented number of candidates and elected officials who were open about their own abortions – “a historic moment” for abortion support, she said.

Advocates in at least 10 states with restrictive abortion policies are now considering ballot initiatives. In Oklahoma and South Dakota, abortion advocates have asked to add initiatives to 2024 ballots; while several key leaders in Missouri, which has a near-total abortion ban, are up for re-election in two years, and the state could also see ballot initiatives in 2024.

New ballot initiatives could enshrine abortion rights into state law in New York, New Jersey and Ohio, a proactive move that several states have taken. In some states, citizens can put forth the proposals to be added to the ballot, or they may ask their state lawmakers to add them.

Next in Kentucky is a legal challenge to the near-total abortion ban after six weeks that has no exceptions for rape or incest and that only allows abortions under a licensed physician’s care and if life-saving organs are threatened. Even if that challenge is successful, the next ban in place is on pregnancies after 15 weeks – so the fight would need to continue, advocates say.

One important takeaway from places like Kansas, the first state to put abortion rights to a vote this summer, is that long-term community organizing and education was highly effective. Other grassroots organizations are taking note. The Afiya Center, a reproductive justice organization in Texas that had to stop its work as an abortion fund due to new state law, is focusing more on community mobilization, voter registration and education campaigns.

“We are actually launching a voter engagement campaign at the top of the year, called ‘I am a reproductive justice voter,’” said Cerita Burrell, director of programs at the Afiya Center. “We need to educate folks more on the electoral process. It really comes down to policy and lawmakers – getting the right people in office that understand the right to full bodily autonomy.”

Elsewhere, the pro-choice movement is not just entrenching but pushing as many laws as they can, “and they’re sticking”, Wells said. “So why don’t we go on the offensive?”

Some groups are focusing on shield laws to protect providers who prescribe abortion medication via telehealth. In July, Massachusetts passed a sweeping law that shields providers who offer care to residents of states where it’s restricted. “With this new law in place, we’re helping get a group together of providers who would then be able to legally provide telehealth care into states that restrict access,” Wells said. Other states should do the same, she said.

Plan C advocates for exactly that, as well as pushing to remove federal regulatory limitations on medication abortion. Some international organizations like AidAccess already ship to places where state law restricts abortion.

Abortion pills are “safer than Tylenol, safer than Viagra – it doesn’t need to be as highly regulated and medicalized as it is”. Wells said. “Why are these restrictions still standing on this extremely safe and effective technology? It’s politics.”

She would like to see abortion medications available over the counter. “Our philosophy has always been you really need to push the envelope and try these things, because they might stand up,” Wells said.

Courtrooms, not coat hangers

With medication and self-managed abortion, safety is not the concern it was in pre-Roe America. The current challenges are not about back-alley abortions and coat hangers, advocates say.

“Self-managed abortion now does not look like what it looked like in the 70s,” said Jennifer Lim, the communications and media director of Indigenous Women Rising, a reproductive justice organization that runs an abortion fund. “We don’t lean in towards, ‘We won’t go back’, because we don’t have to – the future looks very different than what it used to. Abortion pills are very safe, they’re very effective. But the criminalization aspect is a whole different part of it.”

Criminalizing pregnancy was a rising threat even before Roe was overturned, and the Dobbs decision could see prosecutions jump.

So legal assistance in a rapidly changing and often confusing landscape has become a huge new area of focus.

“We need to stop criminalizing people for their pregnancy outcomes,” Wells said. “We need to not have criminal charges falling on a person who needs healthcare in our country.”

And those who have been marginalized – people of color, people living in poverty, gender-variant folks, younger people, immigrants – are the most likely to experience challenges like these. “It’s people who lack access and resources and face obstacles who are left with fewer options,” said Jill Adams, executive director of If/When/How, a legal resource for reproductive justice.

The organization’s Repro Legal Helpline has seen a 14-fold increase in inquiries since the Dobbs decision. “We expect that higher level of interest to maintain, and we have been staffing up,” Adams said. The jumble of reproductive laws in the US is puzzling to anyone attempting to navigate care, Adams said, and many callers at first “need to understand what the legal landscape is – what, if any, legal risks they face so that they can make the decision that’s best for them,” she said.

If/When/How also has a Repro Legal Defense Fund to provide financial assistance to people who have been criminalized for abortion, including partners, friends and family members. The fund supports pre-trial release, with bail bonds and bail alternatives, as well as the full costs of legal defense. More money is going into that, too, Adams said.

Abortion was a “hot topic” in the midterm elections, with politicians relying on the issue to turn out voters, Lim said. “How do we get folks to stay engaged and understand that this is a long-term battle?” she asked. “​​We don’t want to lose momentum.”

175,Fox Sports’ US World Cup coverage is an unmissable abomination,"The World Cup! A tournament of frenzied emotion, spectacular goals, heroic upsets, and grand displays of athletic daring and skill. Or, if you’re watching it in the US: four weeks of shouting, relentless commercial promotion, disorienting cuts and changes of channel to make way for the college football game, and segments in which Alexi Lalas does pump-up speeches for the US team that no one in the US team will ever listen to; a global exhibition of Clint Dempsey’s ongoing quest to assemble vowels and consonants into an order that resembles words; a month-long celebration of the festival that is Landon Donovan’s personality.

At a time when things are clicking on the pitch for the US men’s national team and America finally has a generation of footballers with the technical quality to challenge the world’s best, there’s been something faintly reassuring about Fox Sports’ approach to this tournament. Whereas the USMNT is now a cosmopolitan ensemble of feather-fine talents, the Fox team is the equivalent of a farmers’ league XI that hoofs it long and hopes for the best.

Four years on from the dumbumvirate debacle of its coverage in Russia, Fox is back, and worse than ever. In a world of so much flux, in which so many human connections seem so ephemeral, Fox’s commitment to a losing team – Squeaky Stuey Holden on the match call, Lalas spouting nonsense on set, and Rob Stone holding the whole thing together with the desperate energy of a dad using his daughter’s 18th birthday celebration as a showcase for his own comedic talent – is something we can all get behind.

From the moment that Stone called Doha “Dosa” ahead of the opening match – between the capital of a small oil state on the Gulf and a fermented south Indian pancake, who’s really insisting on the distinction? – then promptly vanished from Fox’s coverage for the next three days, the US host English-language broadcaster of this World Cup has offered up a feast of gaffes, stupidity, and unconquerable on-air awkwardness for American viewers to enjoy. (The official explanation for Stone’s disappearance was that he lost his voice, but it’s possible he’d simply wandered off in search of a snack.) Things are, I’m reliably told, far better over on Telemundo, but those of us without the Spanish skills to appreciate the full vocal exuberance of that channel’s commentators are stuck with Fox. The only solution has been to embrace the misery.

Off-field controversy has clouded this tournament from the day Sepp Blatter pulled Qatar’s name out of the envelope in 2010, but you wouldn’t know anything about that from watching Fox. The BBC relegated the opening ceremony to an online-only stream, preferring instead to air a long report on Qatari human rights abuses. Fox went in completely the opposite direction, airing the whole ceremony and following up with “a look at exploring Qatar, sponsored by the Qatar Foundation”. Many have taken Fox to task for glossing over the rottenness at the heart of this tournament – its legacy of crass commercialization and death. But to be fair, this is not the first time that a group of Americans has blundered into a country in the Middle East without bothering to fully educate itself about the facts on the ground first. The correspondences between American military adventurism and international sports broadcasting may be faint, but the Fox crew has done its best to bring them to the forefront, applying the can-do spirit of Iraq 2003 to its coverage of Qatar 2022.

The acute ambivalence that many throughout the footballing world – including in America – feel about this tournament has been nowhere on display. Nuance, political context, a sense of proportion about a sporting project built on exploitation and influence peddling: all have been lost amid Fox’s non-stop on-air bonfire of jingoism and untroubled uplift. Even by their elevated standards, Rob Stone and co have outdone themselves this World Cup, chuntering and blundering around their Doha base with all the charm and worldliness of a set of Bush administration foreign policy officials.

In these circumstances you might expect Fox’s coverage of the matches, untroubled by politics, to be razor-sharp. You would be mistaken. From its Orientalist redoubt on the Doha Corniche (Arabesque motifs, casino lighting, no actual Arabs unless they’re from the Qatari tourism agency), the Fox team has set about its task with vigor: to beam all the tournament matches into the living rooms of America while being maximally patronizing to the country’s soccer fans. In those rare moments when Fox is not jamming a brand down our throats (“Here’s the player to watch segment, presented by Coca-Cola”, “Your first-half moment, sponsored by Verizon”, “Our player spotlight is hosted by the Volkswagen ID.4”), the network’s hosts, analysts, and match commentators seem determined to mansplain the sport as if we, the soccer-watching public of the United States, have spent the past four decades with our heads in the desert sands surrounding Lusail Iconic Stadium.

Insults to our collective intelligence have come from all angles: the constant, tedious analogies to American sports (stepovers and feints described as “dekes” and “hesis”, corners constantly compared to “pick and rolls”); the neverending quest to “contextualize” the world game by comparing whole countries to American states (“Qatar is the size of Connecticut,” we were told repeatedly on the opening day); the network’s embrace and promotion of the interminable “it’s called soccer” cause (who cares?); the strange extended segment in the run-up to USA v England about how much Harry Kane likes American football (ditto); the employment of Piers Morgan as a special guest pundit (no thanks).

On the field things may be developing nicely, but off it US football – or the version of it that Fox Sports serves up to us every four years – seems destined to remain stuck in a permanent 1994, forever on the brink of becoming America’s next big thing, forever hostage to a cabal of C-suite cable bros intent on translating this exotic, bewildering sport into the language of touchdowns, home runs, and alley oops for what they see as the country’s blinking, insular Yankee Doodle millions. This bizarre cultural parochialism does a disservice to both America’s players, now a sizeable constituency in European club football, and the legions of fans on these shores whose understanding of the sport is every bit as sophisticated as anything you’ll find on the terraces of Camp Nou, Anfield, or La Bombonera.

Take a moment to appreciate the full dizzying scope of Fox’s witlessness in Qatar. After Rob Stone noted, in the lead-up to the group match between Brazil and Serbia, that the Brazilians have won the World Cup five times – perhaps the most widely known World Cup statistic of all – a wide-eyed Dempsey exclaimed, “Wow, you really did your research!” During France v Denmark, match commentator JP Dellacamera described Kylian Mbappé as “a kid who’s 23 and already the whole world is talking about him,” an evaluation whose awestruck “already” suggested that JP has watched close to no football over the past half decade. Donovan started the tournament pronouncing Iran “Eye-ran”, witnessed Tyler Adams being corrected by an Iranian journalist for mispronouncing his country’s name – then continued to call the country “Eye-ran”.

Indeed the mispronunciation of foreign names – stadiums, players, whatever – has become a running joke on Fox’s Corniche set. Asked to offer a prediction before the US match against England, Lalas thundered, “I don’t know how they say it in the King’s English but dose a seero my friends to the USA,” helpfully demonstrating that he doesn’t know how to say “dos a cero” in the King’s Spanish either.

In a big tournament you always want your biggest players to show up, and Lalas, who often gives the impression that he’s being paid by the decibel, has not let the Fox team down this Mundial. From his post at the end of the panel, the big man in the Maga-lite suit has delivered his signature rants with all the enthusiasm of someone who’s blown past the discomfort of knowing that no one else on set finds him interesting or funny. Player rating: 10 out of 10. In support, Dempsey has been dim but fundamentally lovable, Dr Joe Machnik has brought all the authority of his credentials as a non-medical doctor (he has a PhD) and member of the Connecticut Soccer Association Hall of Fame to bear on the important task of quoting verbatim from the laws of the game, and Stu Holden still hasn’t stopped talking from America’s opening match.

Donovan, meanwhile, has pulled off the impressive trick of being both exceptionally boring and weirdly aggressive. In a sport that thrives on innovation, Donovan has developed a kind of anti-chemistry in his rapport with English co-commentator Ian Darke – built on dead air, the flat affect of a Benzoed accountant, and negging (sample own from the Spain v Costa Rica match: “Seven nil looks like an NFL score – you wouldn’t know anything about that Ian”) – that feels genuinely fresh.

Meanwhile, all of Fox’s decent commentators have been tucked away on relative World Cup obscurities like the Netherlands v Ecuador or Australia v Tunisia. Bright spots have been sparse. John Strong enjoyably described Cristiano Ronaldo’s attempt to claim a Bruno Fernandes goal as his own in Portugal v Uruguay as “a hairspray goal if anything”. Maurice Edu has been quietly impressive, offering astute mid-match analysis while eschewing the kind of reductive caricatures that often mar Fox’s coverage of encounters involving the less fancied football nations.

A special word, also, must go to Kate Abdo. Abdo is a great enabler of the hijinks and self-deprecating silliness that make CBS’s coverage of the Champions League so enjoyable. Here, however, as host of Fox’s World Cup Tonight show, she has had to contend with the sentient televisual own goal that is “American soccer fan Chad Ochocinco”. Ochocinco, a former wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals, has for some reason been asked to document his fan experience for Fox at this World Cup – a brief that has yielded such insights as “I liked the game today”, “Ronaldo is my man”, and the 30 seconds of confused silence that consumed Ochocinco after Abdo made a gentle joke about Carlo Ancelotti’s eyebrows. I haven’t tested this thesis exhaustively, but “get all of Chad Ochocinco’s fan experience by downloading the Fox Sports app” – repeated ad nauseam throughout Fox’s telecast – seems a good candidate for the collection of words in the English language least likely to induce the average American TV viewer to download the Fox Sports app.

There’s something almost religious about the experience of watching Ochocinco front up, night after night, with virtually nothing to say about the World Cup or the wildly popular sport it’s based on. That this man, despite possessing no charisma, sense of humor, or gift for sporting analysis, has managed to land a gig as the resident personality on Fox’s “fun” nightly wrap-up show represents its own kind of miracle, a wine-into-water moment for the Fox casting crew.

And this, perhaps, reveals the true genius of the Murdoch empire’s 4D chess, its dark and accidental power: Fox’s coverage of the World Cup is so bad it’s become unmissable. Almost as much as it is an opportunity to watch Mbappé blitz down the left wing or the Brazilian front-five tear opposition defenses to shreds, this World Cup tempts us with the fascination of Fox’s abomination. Glued to the screen by the promise of another Dellacamera insight that’s dead on arrival or a fresh Donovan dunk on Darke, we simply can’t look away. I’d offer more on this point but Lalas is about to do his World Cup power rankings, and nothing gets between me and my daily appointment with Lexi on the Doha disco tiles.",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/05/fox-sports-us-world-cup-coverage-tv-soccer,2022-12-05T00:00:00
176,"Trump did not disclose $19.8m loan while president, documents show","Donald Trump failed to disclose a $19.8m loan from a company with historical ties to North Korea, while he was the US president, according to a new report.

Documents obtained by the New York attorney general, and reported by Forbes, on Sunday indicate a previously unreported loan owed by Trump to Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate.

Daewoo was the only South Korean company allowed to operate a business in North Korea during the mid-1990s.

Forbes revealed that Trump’s relationship with Daewoo is at least 25 years old. At one point, Daewoo partnered with Trump on a development project near the United Nations headquarters in New York City, Trump World Tower.

Trump and Daewoo continued to do business together, including using Trump’s name on six South Korea-based properties from 1999 to 2007, according to the magazine.

The outlet reports that the debt in question “stems from an agreement Trump struck to share some of his licensing fees with Daewoo”.

According to documents reviewed by Forbes, the $19.8m balance remained the same from 2011 to 2016. Five months into Trump’s presidency, the balance dropped to $4.3m, according to paperwork that showcased Trump’s finances as of 30 June 2017.

Soon after, “Daewoo was bought out of its position on July 5, 2017,” the documents said, without disclosing who satisfied the debt.

Forbes reports that even though the loan was reported on the Trump Organization’s internal documents, it was not disclosed on the former president’s public financial disclosure reports. Under disclosure laws, Trump was required to submit the documents to federal officials during his presidential campaign and after he became president.

In 2016, Trump’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, said that Trump had disclosed all debts related to companies that Trump had a 100% stake in.

Despite the apparent gap in disclosures, Trump may not have violated any laws, though the existence of the debt still could have posed a conflict of interest.

While president, Trump bragged about his relationship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, saying in 2018: “He likes me, I like him. We get along” and that “we fell in love”.

The two leaders met in person, but the relationship came to nought.

Meanwhile, on Monday, jurors began deliberating in the Trump Organization tax fraud trial in New York, in which the company is accused of operating a criminal scheme that allegedly involved fraud and tax evasion.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/05/donald-trump-daewoo-loan-financial-disclosure,2022-12-05T00:00:00

Known globally, their gigs were regular sell-out successes until an event at their 2017 Cairo concert changed everything. Playing to 35,000 people, the band looked out at a sea of swaying flickering lights, including an Egyptian fan flying a rainbow flag. This simple act would later be described by authorities as ‘inciting debauchery’, and ultimately catapulted the band, the fan and others into a tragic series of events.

10.2. The Client acknowledges that on occasion, either during the Agreement Term or following termination of this Agreement, GNM may need to remove from, or cease circulation of, certain parts of the Services for legal reasons and accordingly the Client shall, on receipt of a notice from GNM by the Client’s Legal Contact Name(s), cease to reproduce or distribute the relevant part of the Services, including where relevant the immediate removal from any Digital Media. In the event that any part of the Services identified in such legal notice from GNM is reproduced in new editions of the Client Services after receipt of such notice and/or is not removed from Digital Media within twenty-four (24) hours, the Client agrees to indemnify GNM from and against all costs, claims and expenses attributable to and/or resulting from such non-removal.

11.6.2. GNM (or its duly authorised representative) may, during the Agreement Term and for two years thereafter, upon giving reasonable notice to the Client, visit the Cient’s premises during normal business hours to inspect and to make copies of all transaction records (to the extent permitted by the Data Protection Act 1998) relating to the Revenue Share.

11.6.3. Should any inspection reveal that the Client has under-reported or misrepresented any amount payable to GNM, then the Client shall make immediate payment to GNM of the proper amount due together with interest calculated in accordance with Clause 11.4. Should any inspection reveal that Client has over-reported the amount, GNM shall raise a credit note for the appropriate amount.

11.6.4. The rights referred to in Clause 11.6.2 above shall be exercised at the discretion of GNM and at its own expense save that in the event that any such inspection discloses an under-reporting equivalent to ten per cent (10.00%) or more of the total amount that is being accounted for by the Client during the period covered by such inspection, the Client shall forthwith reimburse to GNM its costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith (including enforcing the collection of the under-reported or misrepresented amounts).

If the Force Majeure Event prevents the Affected Party from materially complying with its obligations under this Agreement and it continues for more than 30 days, the other party may terminate this Agreement immediately by written notice.

18.5.

223,"Video: Father Jumps To Action, Saves 2-Year-Old Daughter From Predator","A Los Angeles, California father was captured on home surveillance footage protecting his young daughter from a wild animal as it tried to drag her away from the family’s front yard.

KTLA talked with the father, Ariel Eliyahuo, who explained he’d gotten home from preschool and let his daughter out of the car when he heard a scream while he reached into the vehicle to grab a toy.

Ariel instantly darted around the car and shouted at a coyote who had his daughter’s leg in its mouth.

When the brave dad screamed, the wild dog let go of the girl, the father picked her up and continued yelling at the animal.

While he held his daughter, the father threw objects at the coyote until it finally left the area.

The girl’s mother told KTLA, “For a second, he [Ariel] just turned inside the car and he just heard her screaming and he didn’t see the coyote, he thought she fell. So he ran over and he saw the coyote.”

The mom said the baby girl has some scratches on her face from being dragged and “has a lot of scratches on her left leg,” adding, “one of them is really deep.”

The family had to take the child to the ER and get her rabies shots.

It is allegedly normal for citizens in the area to see coyotes in their neighborhood, and the Eliyahuos are hoping local officials can do something about the dangerous pests.

The incident is also another example of why all Americans, even those living in liberal California, should have the right to carry a firearm on their person at all times.",https://www.infowars.com/posts/video-father-jumps-to-action-saves-2-year-old-daughter-from-predator/,2022-12-05T17:44:25
224,Heavily-Armed Security Guards Patrolling Philly Gas Station,"The owner of a Philadelphia gas station has hired a heavily-armed security detail to guard his business amid an explosion of crime in the city, according to reports.

Guards toting rifles and wearing body armor have been patrolling a Karco gas station at the intersection of Broad and Clearfield streets in North Philly for about three weeks.

Owner Neil Patel says his business and personal property have been repeatedly targeted by criminals, but order has been restored since he brought in personnel from Pennsylvania S.I.T.E. State Agents.

“We are tired from all of this nonsense — robbery, drug trafficking, hanging around, gangs,” Patel told FOX 29.

“They are forcing us to hire the security — high-level security, state level. I fear for the safety of my employees, as well as my nice neighborhood and customers.”

A North Philly owner says he’s had enough violent crime at his gas station so he’s hired these guys to protect his customers and store.



Does this make you feel safer? Or uncomfortable. pic.twitter.com/ZOXvUxTvyW — Jason Martinez (@JasonFox29) December 6, 2022

FOX 29 polled its audience, asking how they felt about “guards with AR-15s at gas stations.”

Approximately 75% of respondents said it made them feel “safer.”

“We wear Kevlar. We are trained. My guards go to training every other week. They’re proficient with [their guns]. They’re proficient with their taser. They know the laws,” S.I.T.E. Chief Andre Boyer explained.

“The law tells us we have a right to protect this property with any means necessary.”

Infowars has been reporting on the surge of crime in Philadelphia and other major U.S. cities.

227,How Ruling Elites Lied about Masks & Mask Mandates,"The mishandling of the covid-19 pandemic by global elites has severely eroded confidence in expert opinion.

New information is emerging that senior officials doubted policies that were foisted upon the American public. By sharing the results of his deposition with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Missouri attorney general Eric Schmitt exposed Fauci’s advocacy of face masks as insincere:

Another tidbit from the Fauci depo: In Feb 20 he emailed a friend advising her that masks were ineffective. Confirmed again on Mar 31. On April 3 he’s adamant masks should be worn even though he couldn’t cite a single study to prove it. Mandates followed—Lives ruined.

Numerous studies disputed the efficacy of face masks, yet mask mandates rose to national prominence. During the apex of pandemic hysteria, the American Institute for Economic Research ran a series of scathing articles debunking the usefulness of face masks. In fact, one prominent 2020 study boldly admitted that mask use is primarily symbolic:

We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes. . . . The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflective reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.

Not even children were spared from the covid-19 hysteria. Masks became commonplace in schools across America and the wider world, despite the large volume of research arguing that they could harm minors. One study from Germany noted that parents raised concerns about mask use having adverse effects on children. Moreover, evidence suggests that mask use limits the expressive capacity of children. Reading the facial expressions of teachers and peers aids a child’s language development, but unfortunately, masks were even required during intergroup conversations.

A recent paper published in the journal Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications argues that mask use has hindered face recognition abilities in children. The researchers posited that impaired face recognition abilities have negative consequences for the emotional development of children, saying that “changes in face recognition performance and alteration in the processing of partially occluded faces could have significant effects on children’s social interactions with their peers and their ability to form relationships with educators.”

Widespread mask mandates failed to benefit children, and instead of averting covid-related deaths, they led to people dying. According to Dr. Zacharias Fogen of Germany, “Mask mandates actually caused about 1.5 times the number of deaths or [approximately 50 percent] more deaths compared to no mask mandates.” Dr. Fogen theorized that the re-inhalation of hyperconcentrated droplets caught by masks led to worse ailments and fueled fatality rates.

The scandal of covid-19 has demonstrated that elites deliberately misinformed the public at every corner. Citizens were scolded for ignoring mask mandates, even though the evidence was clear that they don’t work. The vilification of those who refused to endorse covid-19 vaccines was even more egregious.

Vaccines are usually successful, but covid-19 vaccines were imposed on the public without proper research. Contrary to the claims of politically motivated actors, the latest research on covid-19 vaccines is astoundingly negative. Scientific research shows that rates of myocarditis are higher among the vaccinated and that natural immunity offers great protection against the virus. Moreover, there is overwhelming evidence that the highly touted lockdowns were a disaster. After the ruling elite’s orchestrated deception of the public, we would be foolish to trust their proposals.

The pandemic has rightly taught us that governing elites will fabricate evidence and misuse data to promote their agenda at our expense, and it is unlikely that they will ever be able to regain our trust.

228,You Think Inflation Is Bad Now? Wait Until Next Year!,"Peter Schiff recently appeared on Real America with Dan Ball to talk about the economy, energy prices, and inflation. Peter said if you think inflation was bad this year, wait until next year with a much weaker dollar.

Dan set the interview up with a list of tech firms set to lay off employees. He asked how people can say the economy is just fine when you have tens of thousands getting laid off, nobody has any savings, and when the housing market is tanking.

Peter said they’re going to keep saying that, but it simply isn’t true. He pointed out that the entirety of the Q3 GDP increase was from a decrease in the trade deficit.

“It’s not like it went away. It just got slightly less enormous than it had been. And that was for two reasons. The strong dollar enabled us to buy imports cheaper. But also, all that oil that was released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we got to export that, so that increased our exports and reduced our deficit. And so that helped us out.”

But those impacts are already starting to reverse. The dollar is tanking.

“And all of the economic data that’s come out so far on the fourth quarter suggests that GDP in the fourth quarter is going to be negative again.”

That would mean a drop in GDP in three of the four quarters in 2022. And Peter said the Q4 drop could be the biggest yet.

As far as the petroleum reserves, Peter said we’re going to run out sometime next year.

“And I think in California, by the time Biden finishes his first term, and hopefully his only term, I bet you guys in California will be paying $10 a gallon for gas.”

Currently gas in California is just over $5 a gallon. People feel better because earlier this year it was over $6 a gallon. Dan said “the new normal sucks.”

Peter said that if he is right about the dollar going down, the price of oil will go way up.

“We’ve had the benefit of a strong dollar for the last year or two. So, if you thought inflation was bad this year, wait until you get a load of it next year when we have a weak dollar.”

Dan accurately pointed out that these price increases due to inflation are a tax. Peter said, “absolutely!”

“Every dollar that the government spends must be paid for by the public, one way or another. There are two ways the government gets money from the public. One is honestly, through taxation, where it takes our money and then spends it. But the other way is dishonest. They just print money. They don’t tax us. They print money, and then they spend that into circulation. But when they do that, the price of everything we buy goes up. And so, instead of taking our money, they take our purchasing power. Every time you go to the supermarket and you’re paying a higher price, you’re paying a tax. Those higher prices are the cost of big government. And the more government spends, the higher prices are going to rise.”

Peter and Dan wrapped up the discussion by talking about Biden’s attempt to forgive student loans. A court recently struck the plan down. Peter said that it is hopefully dead in the water because it was a terrible decision.

“It would cause tuition prices to rise much faster in the future than they had in the past. And all of it was going to be financed with the inflation tax. What we need is to end completely government’s involvement in education. No more guaranteed loans. No more direct loans. We need to get the government out of education so we can get the free market in, and that will bring prices way down and quality way up.”

Dan summed up the discussion.",https://www.infowars.com/posts/you-think-inflation-is-bad-now-wait-until-next-year/,2022-12-06T12:15:58
229,Economist Warns: Currency Crisis Will Fuel the Inflationary Fire,"According to the Democrats and many mainstream pundits, the US economy is “resilient.” As Laura Ingraham put it, “it’s all peaches and cream according to Joe and his team.”

But what’s the truth?

Peter Schiff painted a less rosy picture during his appearance on The Ingraham Angle, saying the coming currency crisis is going to fuel the inflationary fire.

Setting up the discussion, Ingraham pointed out that the savings rate has dropped to the lowest level since the Great Recession. Meanwhile, Americans are piling up debt. Meanwhile, we’re starting to see significant layoffs, especially in this tech sector. Is this a sign of a healthy economy?

Former UBS America CEO Robert Wolf said he does see a bright side in all this, arguing that this is nothing like 2008. He said we’re not seeing a lot of leverage in the banking system, the labor market appears strong, and American consumers continue to spend. He said he’s worried about inflation but doesn’t anticipate a “hard landing.”

Peter said he agrees in a way — it’s not like the 2008 recession or the financial crisis.

“It’s actually going to be much worse than that. This is just the beginning. I think we’ve been in a stealth recession all year. But I think the recession is going to get much worse in 2023. But what’s also going to get a lot worse is inflation. Because one thing that has kept the lid on consumer prices in 2022 has been the strength of the dollar. But I think the dollar has lost that strength.”

The dollar index has been falling. In fact, in November, the dollar had its worst month in 12 years. The first few days in December weren’t much better.

“I think we’re going to have a currency crisis in 2023, and that’s going to fuel the inflation fire just as the unemployment rate is really spiking and this recession is kicking into a higher gear.”

Ingraham pointed out that consumers aren’t particularly optimistic. She also noted that with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve having been drawn down, we’re about out of ideas in terms of controlling energy prices. Wolf agreed that energy prices will likely continue to be an issue.

Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently blamed the inflation problem on consumers spending money on goods during the pandemic. She’s not completely wrong. But as Peter pointed out, she left out half of the equation.

“What Janet Yellen is overlooking is just where did all these consumers sitting at home get all this money to buy all that stuff? They got the money from the US government that flooded the economy with PPP money and unemployment benefits that in many cases were two to three times what people earned when they actually had jobs. And so the government made it possible for the unemployed to sit at home and keep spending money as if they still had jobs and were productive members of society. So, the inflation was created by government.”

Wolf mentioned tax cuts, but Peter said that’s not the answer.",https://www.infowars.com/posts/economist-warns-currency-crisis-will-fuel-the-inflationary-fire/,2022-12-05T15:51:42

231,Border Patrol Agents Eviscerate Biden For Saying He’s Got “More Important Things” To Worry About,"Joe Biden declared Tuesday that he has “more important things” to worry about than visiting the border, despite the fact that he was in Arizona anyway for an appearance.

It started with the White House attempting to avoid the issue altogether:

Then Fox News reporter Peter Doocy outright asked Biden why he wasn’t going to check on the border despite being only a few miles away.

Watch:

Watch the latest video at foxnews.com

Biden skipped checking out the border, instead visiting visit a computer chip plant.

Here is the “more important thing” Biden was referring to. A thing Biden clearly has zero understanding of:

Joe Biden reminding America that he isn't with it.



""It will construct a second fab here in Phoenix to build chips, three nano chips, three nano chip, chips that are three nano. Anyway, you know what I'm saying. Nano Nono, I don't know."" pic.twitter.com/LRLybudhto — Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) December 6, 2022

As we have repeatedly highlighted, there is an all our crisis on the border that is about to get even worse:

Border patrol agents were not impressed, with one commenting to the Daily Caller “MORE IMPORTANT THINGS? This is HIS disaster, he created this catastrophe. The border crisis is a total breach of National Security. Give me a fucking break…I can’t wait for this clown to be out of office.”

Another Border agent charged that Biden’s comments betray “another example of how delusional he is.”

“It’s in their narrative to downplay the destabilization of the U.S. What could possibly be more important than criminals and terrorists infiltrating the country and tens of thousands of fentanyl overdoses, mostly being young adults,” the agent added.

National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd added “The President’s most fundamental job is the safety and security of the American people. He’s failing. With a record number of people and dangerous drugs flowing across our borders, the President owes it to this country to go to the border and develop a strategy of security.”

“Unfortunately, President Biden’s record speaks for itself. He cares more about politics than American lives,” Judd asserted.

232,Ted Cruz On Twitter Files Revelations: “This Was All About Weaponizing Big Tech”,"Republican Senator Ted Cruz has weighed in on the revelations in Elon Musk’s ‘Twitter Files’ publication, urging that it is “evidence of corruption that goes to the highest level of government.”

Appearing on Fox News, Cruz asserted that the effort to crush the Hunter Biden laptop story went “to the highest level of the FBI. And it goes to the highest level of Big Tech.”

“We’ve known for a long time that big tech is censoring conservatives,” Cruz said, adding that “what Elon did here is he just laid naked all of the lies that the corporate media has told.”

“It’s clear during the 2020 election, over and over and over again, the Biden campaign and the DNC would reach out to their buddies at Twitter and say, hey we don’t like this, and their response is ‘handled,’ and they’d take it down, over and over and over again,” Cruz stated.

He continued, “And in particular, all of the exchange back and forth when the Hunter Biden laptop story broke, it was evidence that the leadership at Twitter knew within hours that their ridiculous, fake excuse that it was hacked was a ridiculous fake excuse.”

“Even James Baker, who…had been the FBI’s general counsel and then was at Twitter — even he acknowledged well, gosh, we don’t have the evidence on this, but it doesn’t matter, Let’s block it anyway,” Cruz noted, referring to the now fired Twitter Fed, who continued to try to censor Musk’s data dump.

Cruz further highlighted that in “one of the exchanges back and forth they reveal the reason, which is they say we want to avoid — we want to avoid what happened in 2016, Donald Trump winning.”

Thank goodness for the @FBI otherwise we mighthave accidentally elected the wrong person president https://t.co/YihaIWdHhn — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) December 5, 2022

“This was all about weaponizing big tech. It is absolutely corrupt. And what is amazing is the Democrats were fully in on it,” Cruz charged, adding “The corporate media was fully in on it, and Elon’s released the receipts, which shows all of them are willing to abuse power to stay in power.”

233,Video: GOP Senator Tells Woke CEO ‘Best Of Luck’ As He Seeks Republican Help To Avoid Democrat Regulation,"When the CEO of a company with a history of woke virtue signalling came running to Republicans asking for help in a merger deal that Democrats are seeking to block, Senator Tom Cotton hilariously responded “best of luck.”

The discussion in the recent Senate hearing centered around a proposed merger between the Kroger and Albertsons grocery chains, which Democrats have aligned against.

The problem for Kroger is that it has a long history of pushing “diversity and inclusion” training on its employees, including forcing them to wear gay pride logos and firing those who refused.

When the company wants a break, however, it had no qualms running to the GOP.

Cotton was having none of it though, likening the situation to tech companies asking Republicans to protect them from regulation by Democrats.

“I’ve cautioned them for years that if they silence conservatives and center-right voters… if they discriminate against them in their company, they probably shouldn’t come and ask Republican senators to carry the water for them whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers,” Cotton said.

“I’ll say this: ‘I’m sorry that’s happening to you. Best of luck,” he concluded.

Watch:

""I'm sorry that's happening to you. Best of luck.""



Senator @TomCottonAR blasts woke Kroger CEO for expecting Republicans to come to their defense. pic.twitter.com/L9j82kDraA — Townhall.com (@townhallcom) December 6, 2022

Cotton also referenced Kroger’s attempts to stop employees using the words “sir” and ma’am” with an “allyship guide” in an effort to be more gender inclusive.

“Do you really expect 72-year-old employees in rural areas of Arkansas to stop using words like ‘sir’ and ‘ma’am’?” Cotton asked.

Others on Twitter chimed in on the Kroger karma:

In case you didn't know, I got a letter from Kroger today telling me that they will no longer accept Tricare for Life as Medicare Part D for prescriptions. So retired military and spouses are being screwed by Kroger. — Beth Donovan (@AngoraGoatLady) December 7, 2022

I remember when @kroger mandated the COVID jab. I now shop @meijer . — SmallTownDude🇺🇸🇹🇼🇭🇰 (@Small_Town_Dude) December 6, 2022

As a dear friend of a Texas trucker who distributes inventory for Kroger, I hear plenty of stories about how Kroger management deals poorly with all of its employees. A lot of it, sneaky-bad. But I think that's what you get when you unionize. I don't think it gets better. — Jeff Holt (@jeff6times7) December 7, 2022

This is how it should be handled. If ypu wanna play activist, you can do so, but don't expect the very people you smear and actively hate to come running to your aid when the left comes to eat its own, as it always does — Mr_Sloth17 (@Mr_Sloth17) December 7, 2022

234,Climate Change Activists Harry & Meghan Take Private Jet to Pick Up ‘Anti-Racism’ Award in New York,"Climate change activists Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrived in New York on their luxury private jet, the second such trip in a week, to pick up an ‘anti-racism award’, prompting more charges of rampant hypocrisy.

“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived in Manhattan on Monday afternoon by private jet where they were whisked away by a gas-guzzling SUV as they are set to receive a human rights award at Tuesday evening’s elitist Ripple of Hope gala, tickets for which were selling up to $1 million (£847,000),” reports Breitbart.

This is the second such trip in the space of one week. Last week, Markle arrived in Indianapolis via private jet to pick up a ‘female empowerment award’.

Saving the planet might mean you have to give up your annual family vacation, but Harry and Meghan will be free to continue to enjoy their opulent lifestyle while lecturing you about your carbon footprint.

The pair previously took a private jet to attend a celebrity climate change conference in Sicily in 2019.

Indeed, Harry and Meghan took no fewer than FOUR private jet trips in the space of just eleven days in the same year.

Harry previously gave a speech about global warming at the UN declaring “our world is on fire” and that the “crisis will only grow worse.”

Apparently though, it won’t worsen to the point where Harry and Meghan will have to give up their $6.5 million dollar luxury Cessna 680 Citation Sovereign private jet.

According to the Independent, last year, the couple’s non-profit Archwell “issued a net-zero plan which said the organisation is committed to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.”

Presumably, “net-zero carbon emissions” doesn’t include the untold tons of carbon emissions being belched out by their private jet.

The Duke and Duchess were given the Ripple of Hope award in New York alongside other loyal regime servants such as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Ostensibly, the award was for their “heroic” stance against the “structural racism” of the Royal Family, which amounted to claiming, with no actual evidence, that members of it had expressed racist sentiments about their newborn baby.

As we document in the video below, after demanding their privacy be respected, the couple embarked on a series of narcissistic publicity stunts, including a new Netflix docuseries, the trailer for which contained numerous glaring examples of disinformation.

That’s quiet rich given that Harry, during the same UN speech, called for a clampdown on “disinformation” about climate change circulating online.

It’s okay when they do it!

235,Democrat Warnock Beats Walker To Win Georgia Senate Runoff,"Update (2245ET): With 95% of votes counted, a number of mainstream media outlets have called the Georgia Senate Runoff election for incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock.

Well over 1 million people went to the polls Tuesday. That followed record-breaking early voting in the runoff, in which about 1.85 million in-person and mail-in votes had been tallied by Dec. 2, the last day of early voting.

Mr. Warnock’s victory means that Democrats will control the Senate 51-49 starting in January, slightly increasing their hold on the chamber they have controlled since early 2021, when Mr. Warnock was first elected, along with his Georgia Democratic colleague Sen. Jon Ossoff.

The win means Democrats will have control of Senate committees outright and will no longer have to adhere to a power-sharing agreement with the GOP.

* * *

Georgia voters will head to the polls on Tuesday to settle the final Senate contest in the country between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and football legend Herschel Walker, following a four-week runoff that has attracted a flood of outside spending.

The outcome of Tuesday’s vote will determine whether Democrats will have a 51-49 Senate majority, or will maintain the 50-50 control of the chamber which often resulted in the party kowtowing to centrist Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin (WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (AZ).

Atlanta voters were greeted Tuesday morning with 40-degree weather with rain.

The contest between Walker and Warnock pits the state’s first black senator and senior minister against Walker, who has the support of former President Donald Trump. If Warnock wins, it would solidify Georgia’s status as a battleground state heading into the 2024 election, AP reports. If Walker wins, it would reflect limited Democratic gains in the state – particularly in light of Republicans marking wide-ranging victories across the state in last month’s midterm elections.

In that election, Warnock led Walker by about 37,000 votes out of almost 4 million cast but fell shy of a majority, triggering the second round of voting. About 1.9 million votes already have been cast by mail and during early voting, an advantage for Democrats whose voters more commonly cast ballots this way. Republicans typically fare better on voting done on Election Day, with the margins determining the winner. Last month, Walker, 60, ran more than 200,000 votes behind Republican Gov. Brian Kemp after a campaign dogged by intense scrutiny of his past, meandering campaign speeches and a bevy of damaging allegations, including claims that he paid for two former girlfriends’ abortions — accusations that Walker has denied. -AP

On Monday Walker campaigned with his wife, Julie, where he thanked supporters and backed off the attacks on Warnock.

“I love y’all, and we’re gonna win this election,” he told supporters at a winery in Ellijay, adding “I love winning championships.”

As far as campaign spending, Warnock’s has spent around $170 million vs. Walker’s $60 million or so, according to federal disclosures. Their respective party committees have spent more, according to the report.

During the campaign Warnock attacked Walker’s rocky past – claiming the ex-NFL star paid for two former girlfriends abortions, while Walker was forced to admit during the campaign that he fathered three children out of wedlock whom he had never publicly acknowledged.

Walker, a multi-millionaire and successful businessman, has campaigned on his business achievements and philanthropic activities – though he was caught exaggerating, saying he employed hundreds of people and grossed tens of millions of dollars in sales, when in fact he employed eight people and had around $1.5 million in average annual sales.",https://www.infowars.com/posts/democrat-warnock-beats-walker-to-win-georgia-senate-runoff/,2022-12-07T05:09:23
236,“My Jaw Hit The Floor” – Musk Fires Twitter’s ‘FBI-Russiagate’ Lawyer Over Vetting Debacle,"Elon Musk on Tuesday announced that former FBI attorney James Baker, who came to Twitter to serve as deputy general counsel, has been fired after ‘vetting’ recently released evidence of Twitter’s election interference unbeknownst to Musk.

“In light of concerns about Baker’s possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today,” Musk wrote on Twitter, replying to a Dec. 4 Jonathan Turley article shedding light on the incestuous relationship between Twitter, Biden scandals, and Baker.

In light of concerns about Baker’s possible role in suppression of information important to the public dialogue, he was exited from Twitter today — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 6, 2022

Journalist Matt Taibbi, who dropped ‘The Twitter Files‘ last Friday detailing how Twitter executives went behind CEO Jack Dorsey’s back to interfere in the 2020 US election by censoring the Hunter Biden laptop story.

According to Taibbi, Baker was involved in ‘vetting’ information without the knowledge of management.

On Friday, the first installment of the Twitter files was published here. We expected to publish more over the weekend. Many wondered why there was a delay. — Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) December 6, 2022

More:

We can now tell you part of the reason why. On Tuesday, Twitter Deputy General Counsel (and former FBI General Counsel) Jim Baker was fired. Among the reasons? Vetting the first batch of “Twitter Files” – without knowledge of new management. The process for producing the “Twitter Files” involved delivery to two journalists (Bari Weiss and me) via a lawyer close to new management. However, after the initial batch, things became complicated.

Over the weekend, while we both dealt with obstacles to new searches, it was @BariWeiss who discovered that the person in charge of releasing the files was someone named Jim. When she called to ask “Jim’s” last name, the answer came back: “Jim Baker.” “My jaw hit the floor,” says Weiss.

The first batch of files both reporters received was marked, “Spectra Baker Emails.” pic.twitter.com/24a9NhjosB — Matt Taibbi (@mtaibbi) December 6, 2022

The news that Baker was reviewing the “Twitter files” surprised everyone involved, to say the least. New Twitter chief Elon Musk acted quickly to “exit” Baker Tuesday.”Reporters resumed searches through Twitter Files material – a lot of it – today. The next installment of “The Twitter Files” will appear @bariweiss. Stay tuned.

When asked if Baker was asked to explain himself, Musk replied: “Yes. His explanation was …unconvincing.“

Yes. His explanation was …unconvincing. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 6, 2022

His explanation was “ I still work for the FBI” — Rosie Memos (@almostjingo) December 6, 2022

Only discovered this on Sunday — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 6, 2022

Musk has known for a while that Baker was a bad actor, as we presume was looking for the right moment to cut him loose.

Sounds pretty bad … — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 27, 2022

Read more about Baker in Jonathan Turley‘s article noted by Taibbi;

As thousands of Twitter documents are released on the company’s infamous censorship program, much has been confirmed about the use of back channels by Biden and Democratic officials to silence critics on the social media platform. However, one familiar name immediately popped out in the first batch of documents released through journalist Matt Taibbi: James Baker. For many, James Baker is fast becoming the Kevin Bacon of the Russian collusion scandals.

Baker has been featured repeatedly in the Russian investigations launched by the Justice Department, including the hoax involving the Russian Alfa Bank. When Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann wanted to plant the bizarre false claim of a secret communications channel between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, Baker was his go-to, speed-dial contact. (Baker would later testify at Sussmann’s trial). Baker’s name also appeared prominently in controversies related to the other Russian-related FBI allegations against Trump. He was effectively forced out due to his role and reportedly found himself under criminal investigation. He became a defender of the Russian investigations despite findings of biased and even criminal conduct. He was also a frequent target of Donald Trump on social media, including Twitter. Baker responded with public criticism of Trump for his “false narratives.”

After leaving the FBI, Twitter seemed eager to hire Baker as deputy general counsel. Ironically, Baker soon became involved in another alleged back channel with a presidential campaign. This time it was Twitter that maintained the non-public channels with the Biden campaign (and later the White House). Baker soon weighed in with the same signature bias that characterized the Russian investigations.

Weeks before the 2020 presidential election, the New York Post ran an explosive story about a laptop abandoned by Hunter Biden that contained emails and records detailing a multimillion dollar influence peddling operation by the Biden family. Not only was Joe Biden’s son Hunter and brother James involved in deals with an array of dubious foreign figures, but Joe Biden was referenced as the possible recipient of funds from these deals.

The Bidens had long been accused of influence peddling, nepotism, and other forms of corruption. Moreover, the campaign was not denying that the laptop was Hunter Biden’s and key emails could be confirmed from the other parties involved. However, at the request of the “Biden team” and Democratic operatives, Twitter moved to block the story. It even suspended those who tried to share the allegations with others, including the White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who was suspended for linking to the scandal.

Even inside Twitter, the move raised serious concerns over the company serving as a censor for the Biden campaign. Global Comms Brandon Borrman who asked if the company could “truthfully claim that this is part of the policy” for barring posts and suspending users.

Baker quickly jumped in to support the censorship and said that “it’s reasonable for us to assume that they may have been [hacked] and that caution is warranted.”

Keep in mind that there was never any evidence that this material was hacked. Moreover, there was no evidence of Russian involvement in the laptop. Indeed, U.S. intelligence quickly rejected the Russian disinformation claim.

However, Baker insisted that there was a “reasonable” assumption that Russians were behind another major scandal. Faced with a major scandal implicating a Joe Biden in the corrupt selling of access to foreign figures (including some with foreign intelligence associations), Baker’s natural default was to kill the story and stop others from sharing the allegations.

The released documents may show why Twitter was so eager to hire Baker despite his role in the Russian collusion controversies. What likely would have been a liability for most companies seemed an actual draw for Twitter. For censors and political operatives in Twitter, Baker likely seemed like a “made man” for a company committed to systemic censorship. He would be working with the chief legal officer at the company, Vijaya Gadde, who functioned as the company’s chief censor. Gadde was widely reviled by free speech advocates for her dismissal of free speech principles and open political bias.

Not unexpectedly, Gadde and Baker would play prominent roles in the suppression of the Hunter Biden scandal. There was hardly a need to round up “the usual suspects” in the suppression scandal when Musk took over the company. Both lawyers swatted down internal misgivings to bury a story that could well have made the difference in the close 2020 election.

It is striking how many of the figures and institutions involved in Russian collusion claims are within six degrees of James Baker. Not only did Baker work closely with fired FBI director James Comey and other key figures at the Justice Department, but he was an acquaintance of key Clinton figures like Sussmann who pushed the false collusion allegations. He was also hired by Brookings Institution, which also has a curious Bacon-like role in the origins and development of the false Russian collusion allegations.

None of these means that Baker was the driving force of the scandals. To the contrary, Baker earned his bones in Washington as a facilitator, a reliable ally when it came to the business of the Beltway. It is hardly a surprise that Baker found a home at Twitter where “caution” was always “warranted” in dealing with potentially damaging stories for Democratic interests.",https://www.infowars.com/posts/my-jaw-hit-the-floor-musk-fires-twitters-fbi-russiagate-lawyer-over-vetting-debacle-2/,2022-12-07T05:03:08
237,"Europe Puts Scruples Aside, Imports Record Levels of Russian Liquid Natural Gas","The European Union has seen imports of liquid natural gas from Russia rise to record levels this year, sending billions to Moscow while waxing poetic about their support of Ukraine.

Though shipments of natural gas sent via pipelines from Russia to Europe have fallen sharply since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Europe has ironically turned to Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), a chilled form of the gas that can be shipped in sea tankers, to make up the difference.

According to research conducted by the energy market analysis firm ICIS for the German business newspaper Handelsblatt found that imports of LNG from Russia rose by 21 per cent over pre-war levels to the EU states and Great Britain. The analysis found that between January and November of this year, the EU plus the UK paid Moscow nearly 27 billion euros ($28.4/£23.5 billion) in exchange for the record flows of liquid natural gas.

The European money spent on Russian LNG alone, is just under the total aid that EU institutions and member states have sent to Ukraine since the start of the full on war in February. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy Ukraine aid tracker has found that the EU has collectively sent 29 billion euros in military and financial assistance.

While European nations have been largely successful in filling up their gas storage containers prior to the winter, the true test could start to begin in the Spring. Supplies of liquid natural gas on the open market were artificially higher than normal this year given the reduced manufacturing output of Communist China due to Beijing’s draconian zero-Covid strategy, which has severely impacted production.

238,World Health Organization meets to plot censorship of “misinformation” under international pandemic treaty,"Members of the World Health Organization (WHO), an unelected international public health agency, are meeting to consider a draft version of a proposed international pandemic treaty which will give the WHO new powers to “tackle false, misleading, misinformation or disinformation” and be legally binding under international law.

The draft treaty contains various provisions in Article 16 (“Strengthening pandemic and public health literacy”) that require the WHO’s 194 member states (which represent 98% of all the countries in the world) to target so-called misinformation.

Member states are told to “conduct regular social media analysis to identify and understand misinformation,” design their own messaging to “counteract misinformation, disinformation and false news,” and manage “infodemics” (a phrase that was created by the WHO and describes “too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak”).

While the provisions in Article 16 don’t directly call for member states to censor content that’s deemed to be misinformation, a provision in Article 14 (“Whole-of-government and other multisectoral actions”) paves the way for Big Tech to perform this censorship on the WHO’s behalf.

Under this provision, member states are required to collaborate with non-state actors and the private sector through an “all-encompassing whole-of-government, multistakeholder, multi-disciplinary and multi-level approach.”

Before this pandemic treaty existed, Big Tech willingly mass censored any content that it deemed to be “Covid misinformation,” even though there were no agreements or laws forcing them to do so. YouTube even introduced a far-reaching policy that made going against the WHO a violation of YouTube’s rules and deleted over 800,000 videos under this policy.

Under the pandemic treaty, the ties between governments and pro-censorship Big Tech companies will become even stronger and collaboration will be required.

We obtained a copy of the draft international pandemic treaty for you here.

Not only are these Big Tech-government ties being reinforced by the treaty but the WHO has also demonstrated its willingness to censor anything that it brands misinformation. Earlier this year, it called for Big Tech to work with it to censor monkeypox “misinformation.”

Additionally, the idea that the WHO should be acting as an arbiter of truth is especially ironic given that it was one of the most infamous producers of misleading information during the Covid pandemic. In a January 14, 2020 tweet, the organization stated that “preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission” of the coronavirus.

The meeting to discuss the draft treaty began on December 5 and will run till December 7. It’s being attended by members of an intergovernmental negotiating body (INB) that was established by the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the WHO, in December 2021.

The INB was tasked with drafting and negotiating a “global accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.” This global accord has become known as the international pandemic treaty.

Based on the current proposed timeline, the INB expects to finalize the international pandemic treaty by May 2024 and present a final report to the seventy-seventh WHA meeting.

We obtained a copy of the INB’s current proposed timeline for you here.

If passed, the international pandemic treaty will be adopted under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution. This article gives the WHA the power to impose legally binding conventions or agreements on WHO member states if two-thirds of the WHA vote in favor of them.

This process of lawmaking circumvents the usual process of elected officials voting on the laws that apply to their country by allowing a handful of global representatives to decide on the rules that apply to all countries. Even if representatives from a third of the WHO’s member states vote against the international pandemic treaty, it will still be applied to their country under international law.

Not only does this process limit the power of politicians to decide on the laws that apply to their specific country but it also limits the power of citizens to hold politicians accountable at the ballot box. Most of the representatives for member states are unelected diplomats who remain in their positions, even when new governments are elected. And most of the votes that determine whether an international law applies to a specific country are cast by representatives from other countries.

Despite this undemocratic process, the international pandemic treaty has the support of numerous democratic countries including the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the European Council (EC) (which represents 27 European Union (EU) member states).

Some politicians from these countries have opposed the treaty and several petitions, including those that can force a parliamentary debate on the treaty, have gained traction.

However, the international pandemic treaty is still very much on track to being finalized by May 2024 and the WHO has shown no intention of abandoning its far-reaching power grab.",https://www.infowars.com/posts/world-health-organization-meets-to-plot-censorship-of-misinformation-under-international-pandemic-treaty/,2022-12-07T04:51:08
239,Jordan Peterson Calls For YouTube to Censor Anonymous Critics of His Fawning Netanyahu Interview,"Jordan Peterson on Tuesday called for YouTube to segregate all anonymous commenters because his viewers overwhelmingly criticized his embarrassing, fawning interview of Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu.

Peterson, who now works for Ben Shapiro at The Daily Wire, went to Israel last month with Shapiro to shill for Netanyahu.

Since returning, he has made it his mission to ban anonymity on the internet to combat “anti-Semitism” and silence “anonymous troll demons.”

Peterson’s interview with Netanyahu, which closer resembles a paid advertorial than any sort of journalism, was 90 minutes of gaslighting with Peterson letting Bibi bulls**t about every topic under the sun without any serious pushback.

""There wasn't a single refugee when Israel was established.""

The comments were overwhelmingly critical:

Peterson started crying in the comments over the negative responses he was getting:

He then took to Twitter to lobby YouTube to silence his critics.

""I don't hate the Jews. I just love their enemies:"" every serpentine, moralizing anti-Semitic leftist. ""I don't hate the Jews. I'm just telling the truth about their insidious conspiratorial influence:"" every two-bit right-wing tinfoil-hatted envy-inspired troll demon. — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) December 7, 2022

I didn't say anonymity should be banned on @YouTube. I said that that the anonymous troll demon comments should be separated from those of identifiable people. The former can have their hell. Anyone inclined to drop in and visit is welcome to. https://t.co/4In2Bpwcli — Dr Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) December 7, 2022

Here’s a newsflash, Peterson: those comments are just the ones that made it past YouTube’s automated AI censorship algorithms (which were developed together with the Anti-Defamation League).

You’re only seeing a fraction of the backlash against you.

I distinctly remember how Peterson in 2017 canceled Faith Goldy for doing a podcast with The Daily Stormer while covering Charlottesville because he said: “It was her journalistic responsibility to question them, she had to ask at least one hard question — at least one — three would be better.”

Peterson didn’t ask one hard question of Netanyahu, let alone three.

240,U.K. Approves Pfizer Covid Vaccine for Babies Despite Study Showing 1 in 500 Hospitalised With Side-Effects,"Pfizer’s Covid vaccine has been authorised in the U.K. for infants aged six months to four years-old, the medicines regulator confirmed today. The Mail has more.

Covid vaccines were today approved for babies in Britain, in a move likely to spark huge controversy. Regulators gave the green light for all infants older than six months to get a special, low-dose formulation of Pfizer’s jab.

Its decision opens the door for No. 10’s vaccine advisers to choose whether under-5s should be jabbed as part of the U.K.’s vaccination strategy.

Authorities have so far held out on recommending jabs for infants due to concerns that the benefits don’t outweigh any potential risks. Children rarely get seriously ill with the coronavirus, and the majority are thought to have already been infected.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which polices the safety of drugs used in the U.K., made the decision after reviewing data from an ongoing trial.

More than 4,500 infants were given a small 3 microgram dose of the vaccine. For comparison, adults in Britain get a dose 10 times stronger. Older children, who are already allowed to be vaccinated in the UK, get given a dose of up to 10 micrograms.

Lower doses are given to children to avoid complications, such as myocarditis – the rare condition that spooked health chiefs early on in the pandemic.

The jab is given as three injections in the upper arm, with the first two doses given three weeks apart. A third dose is administered at least two months after the second.

The MHRA said the jab triggered common side effects “in-keeping with what can be anticipated from a vaccine in this age group”.

The Commission on Human Medicines – a committee within the MHRA – endorsed approving the vaccine, after reviewing the evidence.

A separate Government group, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, will decide under what circumstances it is dished out.

This could include a list of specific conditions that make children vulnerable to Covid, such as type 1 diabetes or sickle cell disease.

Covid vaccines for children in Briton have so far been incredibly unpopular.

The latest Government data on vaccine uptake shows only 6% of people aged between five to 11 in England have had two doses of a Covid vaccine.

Scores of countries, including the US, China and Israel, already offer vaccines to kids under five, despite huge backlash over the moves. U.S. officials rolled out this version of Pfizer’s shot for the same age group earlier this year. And EU regulators also endorsed the use of Covid vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna for under-5s.

This is madness, obviously, and it is a relief to hear that the JCVI is not likely to follow through on the MHRA’s approval, and also that children’s Covid vaccines are proving so unpopular. The Covid mortality rate in under-20s is one in 300,000, according to the latest studies, and will be lower still in under-5s. Furthermore, that figure includes those with underlying conditions, and the mortality rate in healthy infants will be even lower – basically zero. Up to June 2021, just four children in the U.K. and Ireland aged under 11 had died with Covid; most children who died (nine out of 11 – seven older children also died) had pre-existing conditions. This is not a disease for which children need a vaccine, and certainly not an experimental vaccine with a lamentable safety profile.

On the other hand, the one small mercy is that the dose approved is 3 μg – in the study which found nearly one in 500 small children hospitalised with a serious adverse reaction to the Pfizer vaccine, all of the serious reactions were in the higher dose cohorts. That means that at this lower dosage the current evidence (albeit in a study with a relatively small sample) is that it is not as dangerous as at higher dosages. However, that study only followed up after the first dose. The MHRA approval is for three doses, and the cumulative impact is unknown.

As I say, small mercies.",https://www.infowars.com/posts/u-k-approves-pfizer-covid-vaccine-for-babies-despite-study-showing-1-in-500-hospitalised-with-side-effects/,2022-12-07T04:36:16

242,YouTuber Shows ‘Disastrous’ Cut in EV Truck Driving Range in Cold Weather: ‘Almost Halved’,"A YouTube content creator discovered the driving range of Ford’s Lightning EV truck is significantly reduced in cold weather conditions.

According to YouTuber Tyler Hoover, the estimated driving distance of Ford’s all-electric F-150 Lightning, which is displayed to drivers in the vehicle’s instrument cluster, basically gets cut in half in 30-degree weather.

The cut in driving range was immediately noticeable upon Hoover dropping his daughter off at school, where the YouTuber commented, “That school run was only 2 miles… I think we started with 149. We’re at 143.”

“So 7 miles of range to go 2 miles, unloaded. There’s no trailer back there. It’s just cold outside.”

Driving to another location, Hoover observed he’d used up 50 miles of range to complete just 32 miles.

The range decreased further as Hoover headed back home driving against the wind, where he used up 40 miles of range just to travel 15 miles.

After the vehicle’s “low range” warning popped up, the YouTuber compared the disastrous results of his current demonstration to another recent test where he discovered the Lightning’s driving range was cut when trying to tow a car on a trailer, noting even in that test the warning didn’t pop up until he was home.

“Wow! That’s not quite as bad as towing a light load, but that’s still really, really bad,” Hoover summarized.

Arriving back home, Hoover noted, “We started with 149 and we went 64 miles. So that’s 120 miles of range in 60 or so miles – doing nothing. It’s just cold outside.”

After the demo, Hoover admitted the person he co-owns the Lightning with was considering selling the vehicle due to the driving range.

“He drives around all day for work. He’s a liquor rep, stops in dozens of liquor stores over the course of a week. So he is barely keeping up when it comes to charging at home and the range of this truck in winter, and it is stressing him out. So he’s not sure if he wants to keep this thing anymore.”

Tips provided by Ford for increasing driving range during cold weather include charging it while not running the vehicle’s heater, prompting Hoover to quip, “So when you’re waiting to charge your car be as cold as you possibly can so it charges quicker. Really?”

The video ends with Hoover deciding he’s going to trade the vehicle in for the GMC Hummer EV, which appeared to handle the cold weather much better.

The YouTuber’s latest test comes after he showed the Lightning “can’t do normal truck things” when he attempted to tow a car from one location to another.

In the event someone was trying to tow something, “You would be stopping every hour to recharge, which would take about 45 minutes a pop, and that is absolutely not practical,” he noted in that case.

Imagine living in a harsh climate and buying an EV vehicle only to discover your car’s driving distance is cut in half when you need it most. That’s sadly a reality for many Americans who’ve been duped by the EV craze.

243,The Future of the GOP: Alex Jones Weighs In on DeSantis Calling Out Vax Manufacturers,"Alex Jones breaks down Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) setting the standard of the GOP platform in 2024 by calling out Big Pharma companies for pushing deadly experimental COVID injections knowing full well they were not “safe and effective.”

After venting his frustrations about former President Donald Trump refusing to come out against the experimental COVID shots despite realizing he was tricked about their efficacy, Jones explained that DeSantis is making all the right moves on that front.

“DeSantis has progressively gotten more hardcore, saying children shouldn’t take the shots, the military shouldn’t be mandated to take the shots. That’s stuff Trump said too,” Jones said Tuesday.

“But then he started going after the lies and blocking of alternative treatments and the attempts to forcibly inject people. And now he’s started coming out and saying, ‘We’re gonna investigate the vaccine makers because these aren’t vaccines, and these weren’t approved right and they’ve hurt a bunch of people and we’ve got to punish them so they don’t do it again.'”

245,"US, EU Reportedly Lose Track of $200 Billion in ‘Frozen’ Russian Funds","The United States and its European allies are having trouble actually locating two thirds or more of the Russian assets they froze earlier this year “because they do not know where exactly they are,” Charles Lichfield, a senior finance expert at the Atlantic Council, has indicated.

Speaking to Estonian media, Lichfield, the deputy director of the Washington-based think tank’s GeoEconomics Center, and expert on Russia’s central banking system, said Western countries actually seized closer to $80-$100 billion, not $300 billion, as has been widely reported.

Lichfield explained that the “freeze” on Russian assets obligated foreign banks not to allow for their transfer back to Russia, on penalty of losing their ability to transact in dollars and euros. However, some Asian and African banks may not have felt the need to respond to requests for information from Western authorities regarding transactions involving Russia, he said.

The US Treasury triumphantly announced in June that Washington and its allies had blocked or frozen some $300 billion in Russian state assets, plus $30 billion worth of assets of sanctioned individuals, including Russian tycoons.

Last week, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen proposed creating a special structure to manage the assets and “invest them.”

However, EU officials specified to media that Brussels couldn’t simply seize the Russian assets to use them in Ukraine because the bloc adheres to the principle of state immunity.

In the US, officials have expressed similar hesitation. Last month, lawmakers proposed a provision in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act bill to allow for the transfer Russian assets to Ukraine, but the idea was met with opposition amid fears that the idea had not been “fully litigated.”Russian officials have slammed the asset freeze as a form of “theft.”

The West’s actions has also prompted Chinese regulators and banks to brainstorm ways to keep their own assets stashed abroad safe if the US and its allies moved against them in the way they have against Russia.

Russia’s frozen assets were previously estimated to constitute close to half of the country’s $640 billion reserve cushion. According to the Central Bank’s year-end report for 2021, the largest portion of its foreign currency and gold was stored in China (16.8 percent), followed by France (9.9 percent), Japan (9.3 percent), the United States (6.4 percent) Britain (5.1 percent), Canada (2.7 percent) and Australia (2.5 percent), with more than 51 percent thus located in states which have slapped sanctions on Moscow.

246,Zelensky Tapped Top Balenciaga Designer to Oversee Charity For Ukraine Refugees,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over the summer had recruited fashion brand Balenciaga’s creative director to oversee a charity supporting Ukrainian refugees.

United24, which bills itself as a charity aimed at rebuilding Ukraine and helping refugees, claimed in July that Balenciaga’s artistic director Denma, who only goes by his first name, would become the organization’s “ambassador.”

“Demna, artistic director of @BALENCIAGA, is selected as ambassador for #united24. He will be exclusively dedicated to the Rebuild Ukraine direction for helping refugees,” the charity tweeted, which included a link to its website.

“The humanitarian Rebuild Ukraine Direction focuses exclusively on the renovation of critical infrastructure facilities such as roads, bridges, hospitals and schools to enable refugees to come back to their homes and restart their lives,” the website states.

This came before Balenciaga was recently embroiled in scandal over its disturbing ad campaigns overseen by Denma featuring children holding teddy bears in BDSM outfits and a hidden Supreme Court document overturning a child pornography law.

Balenciaga has since scrubbed its social media presence before issuing numerous apologies.

After weeks of silence, Denma last week issued an apology for incorporating children in a BDSM and occult-themed Balenciaga ad campaign that erupted into a full-fledged scandal that culminated with former fans burning Balenciaga merchandise in protest of its pedophiliac themes.

“I want to personally apologize for the wrong artistic choice of concept for the gifting campaign with the kids and I take my responsibility. It was inappropriate to have kids promote objects that had nothing to do with them,” the 41-year-old wrote on Instagram.

“I apologize to anyone offended by the visuals and Balenciaga has guaranteed that adequate measures will be taken not only to avoid similar mistakes in the future but also to take accountability in protecting child welfare in every way we can,” he concluded.

Speaking of occultism, in some bizarre new iteration of asymmetric warfare, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense announced Monday it had recruited actual witches to cast hexes and curses on Russian soldiers.

Render unto God that which belongs to God and unto the enemy that which is of the enemy.

Beware, enemy – you'll get what the witch wants. 🇺🇦 volunteers dressed as witches, sending love to our soldiers and the…opposite…to our enemy.

Notably, Ukraine has also been leveraging the openly neo-Nazi Azov Battalion, who’ve been captured on video conducting pagan “blood and soil” rituals.

What’s with Ukraine’s ties to the occult?

The creation of the charity is curious given Ukraine already received tens of billions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers prop up its war against Russia and launder money back to Democrat campaigns.

Where did all that money go?

247,Takeaways from the 2022 Georgia runoff: Warnock's win expands Democratic power in the Senate as his own star rises,"ATLANTA — Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock wrapped up his “one more time” tour with a victory Tuesday in the runoff, defeating Republican rival Herschel Walker to secure a six-year term.

“Against unspeakable odds, here we stand together,” he said.

Here are four takeaways from the Georgia runoff:

Warnock's star rises

The “senator reverend,” as he calls himself, keeps winning.

Warnock has been on the ballot five times in a roughly two-year span — one Democratic primary, two general elections and two runoffs — and finished first each time. Along the way, he has dispensed with three Republican contenders (before Walker, he faced former Sen. Kelly Loeffler and former Rep. Doug Collins in a 2020 special election).

It’s a remarkable feat for a political newcomer in two different political environments, and even more so for the first Black person elected senator from Georgia, once a bastion of the Confederacy.

Warnock spent the last few years in permanent campaign mode, his fate long appearing uncertain in this purple state during a challenging landscape for Democrats. That had minimized any chatter about his future prospects. But this electoral success is sure to elevate his star, possibly into the echelons of presidential or vice-presidential contenders.

Asked if Warnock is a future White House candidate, his campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, told NBC News on Tuesday: “I don’t know. I think Sen. Warnock is very tired and I think he’s been campaigning for a long time. I can’t wait to see what he does, but I know he can’t wait to see what he can do when he has a full six-year term to represent the people of Georgia.”

Democrats expand their Senate power

Warnock’s victory gives Democrats their 51st seat — an outright majority that ends their reliance on Vice President Kamala Harris for tie-breaking votes.

In practice, that means smoother sailing on executive nominees and judges, without Republicans having the ability to force deadlocked committee votes and make the Senate jump through extra procedural hoops. It also means more power for Democrats to issue subpoenas without Republican buy-in, setting up a contrast to the GOP-controlled House’s plans to aggressively investigate the Biden administration. And it means that no single member, like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., can make or break the party’s agenda.

""Reverend Warnock’s well-earned win is not just a victory for Georgia, but also for democracy — as the last brick in our firewall against extremist MAGA Republican policies that threaten the very essence of our democracy,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/takeways-georgia-runoff-warnock-wins-rcna60167,2022-12-07T04:25:07.780000+00:00
248,Democratic Sen. Warnock defeats Republican Walker in Georgia runoff,"ATLANTA — Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeated Republican football star Herschel Walker on Tuesday in Georgia’s Senate runoff election, NBC News projects, handing President Joe Biden and his party a key win.

Warnock’s victory will give Democrats an outright majority in the Senate after two years under a 50-50 divide, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes.

The win cements Biden's unexpected midterm success, allowing his party to grow the majority in the Senate.

The outcome is also another blow to Donald Trump, who backed Walker, making him the final in a series of candidates the former president supported this year who failed to win competitive races.

Senate Republicans had been hoping to get a headstart on the 2024 election, when the electoral map heavily favors the GOP. But Walker was dogged by scandals, a more than 2-to-1 spending disadvantage and lack of confidence in both the candidate and his campaign from some GOP officials.

Republicans typically wait to vote on Election Day, but their voters did not turn out on a damp and drizzly Tuesday in the numbers that Walker needed to overcome the advantage Warnock had banked during the early vote window.

""After a hard-fought campaign — or should I say campaigns — it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy: The people have spoken,"" Warnock told supporters.

Biden said he called Warnock Tuesday night to congratulate him. ""Tonight Georgia voters stood up for our democracy, rejected Ultra MAGAism, and most importantly: sent a good man back to the Senate,"" Biden tweeted. ""Here’s to six more years.""

In an interview with NBC News, Warnock campaign manager Quentin Fulks credited the victory in part to driving the contrast between candidates — and continuing to appeal to independent and Republican-leaning voters who had reservations about Walker.

“When it turned out to be Herschel Walker, we immediately looked at the landscape and saw an opportunity to say that we can make this race about ‘the Reverend’ versus ‘the running back.’ And if we did that, we could control our own destiny within this cycle,” Fulks said.

“There could have been other campaign operatives or another campaign that could have said, ‘OK, Herschel Walker has all this baggage, so we’re just going to run to the left and just try to turn out as many of our voters and just let Republicans eat their own,’” Fulks added. “We didn’t do that.”

Fulks said one of the biggest challenges was to motivate voters to turn out on an unusual Dec. 6 Election Day.

“We had to make our own energy organic,” he said

The runoff election was triggered by state law because neither candidate won an outright majority in the November election

Democrats’ 51st vote means they can rip up the power-sharing arrangement they struck with Senate Republicans and secure a clear majority of votes on committees. They’ll also have one vote to spare on matters like confirming executive branch nominees and judges.

The extra seat could also be critical to Democrats’ chances of retaining the majority in 2024, when some of the party's most vulnerable incumbent senators are up for re-election.

Democrats say, Walker's defeat is a sign that Americans are rejecting Trumpism as the former president looks to regain the presidency.

“This election marks the first midterm since 1934 where the party in power successfully defended every incumbent Senate seat,"" said J.B. Poersch, the president of Democrats' Senate Majority PAC, which says it spent $85.7 million in Georgia this year. ""Voters in Georgia and across the country have sent a message loud and clear by firmly rejecting GOP extremism and re-electing a Democratic Senate majority that will continue delivering for the American people.""

The outcome, along with last month's defeat of former Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate Mehmet Oz, also showed the limits of celebrity. Walker, who was backed by former President Donald Trump, was a star running back for the University of Georgia and the NFL, and was a member of the U.S. Olympic bobsled team in 1992.

Georgia has been a reliably red state until just two years ago, when it voted for President Joe Biden and then elected Warnock and fellow Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff in twin runoff elections.

Walker has warned Republicans that they need to turn out to stop national Democrats from gaining more power. “If you don’t vote, you’re going to get more of Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden,” he told Fox News’ Sean Hannity Monday night.

A drizzly and chilly Tuesday did little to dampen the motivated voters of Atlanta.

Duane Cochenour, a 61-year-old attorney, cast a vote in his midtown Atlanta precinct for Walker. But he said he’s “not crazy about” the Republican and was reluctant to support him.

“I’m not a Donald Trump fan at all. I really wish he would go away. That’s my biggest negative in voting for Walker — I didn’t want to be perceived as a vote in favor of a Trump candidate,” Cochenour said, reflecting the mood that helped turn Georgia blue two years ago. “But I felt like the importance of taking the Senate back outweighed that.”

Matthew Pinder, 24, said he voted for Warnock because he's ""reasonable"" and ""the other candidate isn’t.""

249,Herschel Walker’s loss is just more bad news for Trump,"WASHINGTON — The Trump train is stuck in the station, and it was weighed down Tuesday with the new baggage of corporate tax-fraud convictions and a final midterm defeat.

In the three weeks since former President Donald Trump launched his comeback bid from a ballroom of his Mar-a-Lago club, he has exhibited little of the energy that made him a force in national politics, but many of the behaviors that led voters to oust him two years ago, according to Republican strategists.

During his short campaign, Trump has dominated headlines by dining with the rapper Ye, who has gone on antisemitic tirades in recent weeks, and the white nationalist Nick Fuentes. More recently, Trump advocated for the “termination” of articles of the Constitution as a means to overturn his 2020 defeat.

Two Trump companies were found guilty of criminal tax fraud in New York's highest court Tuesday. He also watched helplessly in recent days as courts handed his tax records to Congress, dragged his White House lawyers before a grand jury and facilitated an investigation into his removal of classified documents from the White House.

And on Tuesday night, Herschel Walker’s loss in a Georgia Senate runoff added an exclamation point to the argument that Trump hurt the GOP by picking a bad crop of candidates in swing states. Trump's Monday tele-rally for Walker didn't provide the necessary boost.

“Frankly, he should have waited [to launch his campaign until] after the Georgia contest was decided,” said Michael Biundo, a national Republican strategist who served as an adviser to Trump in 2016 and is based in New Hampshire, which is scheduled to host the first GOP primary. “To me, the rollout seemed rushed and incomplete. I give it a D-minus.”

Biundo’s observation is widely shared across the GOP and even among some Trump confidants. But there’s also a latent belief among many Republicans that Trump has an almost magical grip on party faithful who just don’t care what the elites think.

“The stuff you’re seeing on the news or the influencer-types on Twitter, you’re not seeing that on the ground with Trump,” said Wes Donehue, a top Republican digital strategist from South Carolina, which holds the first primary in the South.

“Trump still controls the Republican Party with everyone I talk to, whether it’s people in county parties or just conservatives at the bar or guys at the gym,” he said. “People are ignoring the media, the influencers, and it’s just Trump’s to lose. South Carolina is Trump country. People like Trump a lot here. And they like [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis. They just think he’s the future, but Trump is the present.”

Still, Trump hasn’t offered much in the way of a new vision for the country. He has neither blitzed the country with his trademark rallies nor, GOP insiders say, left prospective rivals for the 2024 presidential nomination quaking in his wake. There are small signs that fellow Republicans, including prospective challengers, are more willing to criticize Trump, as Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and others did over his remarks on the Constitution.

“I’ve watched the other party really erode many of the constitutional principles that I hold dear, and, as Republicans, we should not contribute to this,” Youngkin said at a Wall Street Journal conference Tuesday. “I think our job is to defend and protect the Constitution.”

Despite the indirect reproach, however, Youngkin avoided answering the specific question he was asked: whether Trump had disqualified himself as a Republican Party nominee for president.

But if Trump had hoped to scare away challengers, his sputtering launch could do the opposite, according to a senior official on Trump’s 2020 campaign.

“The design of this was to come out, be the front-runner and scare everyone out, and all the last few weeks have done is encourage donors and voters to go window-shopping,” the source, who did not want to publicly criticize the de facto party leader, said. “This is the problem with coming out this early and not being strong: All it does is force people to look for other options.”

DeSantis is now more popular among Trump’s 2020 supporters than Trump, according to a survey conducted by the firm WPA Intelligence as part of a review of the midterm elections. The poll found that DeSantis’ net favorability among Trump voters is plus-69, while Trump’s is plus-44. A narrow plurality of Republicans — 40 percent to 37 percent — said Trump should no longer be seen as the leader and face of the GOP.

Former Vice President Mike Pence, currently on a tour for his book “So Help Me God,” is looking at a 2024 bid, as are a string of former Trumpworld figures and anti-Trump Republicans. John Bolton, who served as Trump’s national security adviser, told NBC’s Kristen Welker on Monday that he would consider running to stop Trump if other candidates aren’t willing to repudiate Trump’s remarks on the Constitution.

“I’d like to see Shermanesque statements from all the potential candidates,” Bolton said. “If I don’t see that, then I’m going to seriously consider getting in.”

But Trump’s campaign and defenders point out that no one has yet to file against him and, they say, he’s picking up endorsements and campaigning in an under-the-radar way by speaking to select conservative groups, such as the Republican Jewish Coalition last month, or by providing pre-recorded video messages, which he did for the Patriots Freedom Fund, a group that represents people charged in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

“This is a marathon and our game plan is being implemented even though the presidential calendar hasn’t been set yet and the 2022 midterm cycle is still ongoing,” Steven Cheung, a spokesman for Trump, said. “We however are not going to be lectured by political swamp creatures who are already looking to find ways to make a quick buck in 2024 by running to the media and providing cowardly background quotes. … President Trump is the single, most dominant force in politics and people — especially those who purport to be close to him — should never doubt his ability to win in a decisive and dominant fashion.”

Trump's universal familiarity to voters and early start grant him exclusive advantages over the crowd of hopefuls tip-toeing around the 2024 arena.

“Other candidates, what they’re doing right now is just exploring how they can increase their name ID and increase their exposure,” said one Republican with ties to Trump world who was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity to share thoughts. “But they’re not doing anything to actually say, ‘I’m running.’”

Matt Moore, a former chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, said he’s seen little evidence of anyone campaigning in his crucial early primary state.

“Obviously Trump hasn’t done much anywhere at this point,” Moore said. “But he could put on the after-burners at some point. Trump is still very popular here.”

Republican primary rules disproportionately award convention delegates to candidates who win pluralities in state nominating contests. That means that Trump, as he did in 2016, could win a nomination while winning far less than half the vote in states where multiple candidates are on the ballot.

One longtime outside adviser who tacitly acknowledged the early stumbles said that they won’t matter if the course is corrected by the time candidates really begin campaigning for votes.

“Let’s get the holidays behind us. Then in early 2023, I expect the Trump campaign to start rolling out an effort to lock down the early primary states,” the adviser said. “If Trump can put together early primary support, if he can raise a bunch of money, he’ll be hard to beat. … If you fail by June of next year, if you’re sputtering along, you can expect major challenges.”

It’s not yet clear whether Trump will be able to raise the money necessary to dominate the GOP primaries or compete effectively in a general election in 2024. Two years ago, his campaign struggled to keep up with the massive infusion of cash that helped put Democrat Joe Biden in the White House, and some of the money earmarked to help him win this time around is being diverted to lawyers involved in the various proceedings against him.

The Washington Post reported this week that Trump’s Save America PAC has raised conflict-of-interest concerns — and diminished cash reserves for efforts to help his campaign — by paying legal fees for witnesses in those proceedings.

The dual realities of Trump’s early bumbling and persistent formidability are one reason that several Republican strategists refused to openly criticize the former president's nascent run.

“As you can imagine, it would make a big difference if we’re on the record or off the record,” said one national GOP strategist who agreed to be quoted on the condition of anonymity because he has clients who don’t want to get crosswise with Trump.

“The one thing Trump had to do was come out of the block looking like a winning presidential candidate in 2024,"" the strategist said, ""and I think he has looked anything but that.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/herschel-walkers-loss-just-bad-news-trump-rcna60108,2022-12-07T03:22:51.477000+00:00
250,Jury finds Trump Organization guilty of tax fraud scheme,"A jury in New York on Tuesday found the Trump Organization guilty of all charges in a sweeping, 15-year tax fraud scheme that prosecutors said was orchestrated by top executives at the company.

Jurors deliberated for just over a day before returning the guilty verdicts on a total of 17 counts, including scheme to defraud, conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. The company faces roughly $1.6 million in fines when it's sentenced. The sentencing is expected to take place on Jan. 13, 2023.

“The former president’s companies now stand convicted of crimes. That is consequential. It underscores that in Manhattan we have one standard of justice for all,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg told reporters, calling the underlying case one of “greed and cheating.”

The Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, its former longtime chief financial officer, were indicted last year after a multiyear investigation into the company’s financial practices by the Manhattan district attorney’s office.

Prosecutors alleged that two corporations that are a part of the company, Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp., paid their ""already highly paid executives,"" including Weisselberg, even more by ""cheating on their taxes” through a series of schemes that included off-the-books perks like luxury cars and free apartments.

In a statement, Bragg said that “the Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes,"" and the ""verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.""

Trump said in a statement that he was ""Disappointed with the verdict in Manhattan, but will appeal.""

He called the case ""unprecedented"" and ""a continuation of the Greatest Political Witch Hunt in the History of our Country. New York City is a hard place to be 'Trump,' as businesses and people flee our once Great City!""

Weisselberg, 75, pleaded guilty to 15 felony charges in August and was the prosecutors' star witness. He agreed to pay nearly $2 million in taxes, interest and penalties and serve five months in jail as part of his guilty plea.

The companies argued that Weisselberg, who is still on the Trump Organization's payroll, was the lone bad actor. They contended he masterminded the scheme for his own personal benefit, not the company's.

“We are here today because of one reason and one reason only, because of the greed of Allen Weisselberg,” defense lawyer Susan Necheles said in closing arguments.

Necheles stood by that stance after the verdict.

""This case was all about Allen Weisselberg committing tax fraud on his personal tax returns. Every witness repeatedly testified that President Trump and the Trump family knew nothing about Allen Weisselberg’s actions,"" she said. ""We disagree with the jury's verdict.""

A spokesperson for the Trump Organization said, “The notion that a company could be held responsible for an employee’s actions, to benefit themselves, on their own personal tax returns is simply preposterous.”

Earlier at the trial, which began in late October, Weisselberg and another top official testified that other senior executives also benefitted from the scheme and that the company also benefitted by not having to pay payroll tax and other taxes because of the scams.

Trump, who was not charged, complained about the case on social media Tuesday morning. After falsely claiming on Truth Social that murder and violent crimes are at an all-time high in New York City, the former president said the district attorney's office had been ""fighting a political Witch Hunt for D.C. against 'Trump.'""",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/jury-finds-trump-organization-guilty-tax-fraud-scheme-rcna60326,2022-12-06T23:23:59.270000+00:00
251,"In closing arguments, prosecutors say Trump knew of tax fraud at his company","Prosecutors in the Trump Organization tax fraud trial said in their closing arguments Friday that the former president sanctioned what became a sweeping 15-year scheme to compensate top company executives off the books.

The prosecution's attention on Donald Trump shortly before the jury is handed the case marked a notable shift in a weekslong trial that has largely focused on other top executives at the family business. Trump has not been charged with any wrongdoing.

“Donald Trump is explicitly sanctioning tax fraud. That’s what this document shows,” Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told jurors in Manhattan Criminal Court on Friday. “This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not real.”

Attorneys for the defense objected to the late-trial move by the prosecution, which also mentioned Trump at the beginning of closing arguments on Thursday.

Michael van der Veen, who represents the Trump Payroll Corporation in the case, asked the judge for a mistrial.

“We picked a jury ... based on the people’s representations that Donald Trump was not on trial,” he said Friday, adding that the prosecution has now “made him a co-conspirator.”

Van der Veen said raising Trump’s name in association with the crime in this case was wrong. “It is wholly improper, it is a bias that he put on the jury that can’t be undone.”

Steinglass responded, saying, “We have religiously avoided politics.”

Steinglass further argued that he’s allowed to raise the name of the CEO when the case is against his company. “It had nothing to do with the fact he is Donald Trump, but the fact that he is the CEO of the company. If his name was John Doe, there would be no objection here.”

The case is being heard in state Supreme Court, New York’s highest trial court.

The 15-count indictment in the case charges the company and longtime CFO Allen Weisselberg with scheming to defraud, tax fraud and falsifying records. Weisselberg was also hit with a grand larceny charge. Prosecutors say he used his position to get out of paying taxes on $1.7 million in income.

Weisselberg, 75, pleaded guilty to 15 felony charges in August. No one else has been charged.

Trump has publicly blasted the investigation into his company as a politically motivated “witch hunt.”

Acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan indicated this week he was surprised by the new attention on Trump in the case, but told prosecutors they could make their accusations during closing arguments because much of the discussion before the trial, and during jury selection, revolved around the fact that Trump was not sitting at the defense table.

Additionally, attorneys for the Trump Corporation and Trump Payroll Corporation invoked the former president’s name several times Thursday and said several times that he had no knowledge of any tax schemes or Weisselberg’s admitted illegal activity.

Merchan on Friday denied the defense's request for a mistrial. ""I don’t believe it is necessary to declare a mistrial, nor do I think that’s even a thought,"" he said.

The jury is expected to begin its deliberations on Monday.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/closing-arguments-prosecutors-say-trump-knew-tax-fraud-company-rcna59878,2022-12-02T21:20:04.064000+00:00
252,Salt Lake City’s efforts to fight pollution face a new challenge: Toxic dust,"Neighborhoods higher in elevation — more often above the inversion’s cap — are typically less impacted as pollution builds. But on the west side, closer to many sources of pollution, residents can get stuck in a thicker pea soup of car exhaust, refinery emissions and other pollutants.

“It irritates the eyes and gives me sinus infections,” said Jorge Casillas, 58, who has lived on the west side for 15 years. “It’s hard to be trapped in the valley.”

Overall, emissions have improved in Salt Lake City, mostly because of vehicle emissions standards enacted by the Obama administration’s EPA, according to Perry. The EPA in 2021 proposed re-listing the Salt Lake City area as in “attainment” for small particle pollution it had been failing to sufficiently control.

“When we switch to electric vehicles, our air quality is going to improve dramatically,” Perry said.

But wildfires and dust storms off Great Salt Lake are erasing the progress that has been made. For those in the West Side, it adds a new layer of concern for their health.

“There’s so much sediment and so much trapped for so long. It’s pulling up stuff that’s been trapped for 100 years,” Casillas said. “Are there carcinogens or other health risks? That’s what I’m worried about. There’s so many children in the neighborhood.”

A drumbeat of media coverage over dust and pollution has frightened some Utahans.

“I’ve received a number of emails from concerned citizens reconsidering living in Salt Lake City,” said Janice Brahney, an assistant professor at Utah State University’s watershed sciences department.

‘We don’t know’

When USGS researchers mapped the samples collected from their dust traps, they found something interesting.

While other metals such as nickel, thallium and lead were more likely to exceed those EPA markers in poorer, less-white communities like Rose Park, arsenic was more concentrated in samples from wealthy communities, possibly because of its past use as a fertilizer on agricultural lands.

The researchers suspect that urban, diverse neighborhoods are receiving much of their dust and the toxic metals within that dust from local sources — nearby polluters or construction projects. It’s also possible that dust from the Great Salt Lake and other nearby playas picks up local pollutants from nearby mines, refineries and pesticides as dust travels into the city.

Meanwhile, researchers found the highest levels of dust — and metals — in suburbs outside urban Salt Lake City. Researchers suspect communities north of the city, including areas such as Syracuse, Ogden and Bountiful could be receiving the majority of the dust that blows off the lake. In early October, less than a mile from what was once lakeshore, workers were hammering away to frame new housing.

These areas are an air monitoring dead zone, Perry said.

“There’s almost no sampling done north of Salt Lake City,” he said. “We’re really lacking a coherent network to answer the question of who is impacted the most.”

Putman and colleagues this year set up another 17 dust traps — all nicknamed “Woody” — in counties north of Salt Lake to better evaluate the risk for those areas.

So much remains unknown. While the EPA has screening levels for metals in soil, no environmental standards exist for exposure to toxic metals contained in dust.

“How much arsenic does there have to be over a 24-hour-period for dust to cause problems — we don’t know. We don’t have any study that can tell us that,” Putman said. “What are the short- term or long-term consequences of that? We don’t know at all.”

Researchers are also unsure if the arsenic and other metals in the dust are “bioavailable” — meaning they can be absorbed into plants, animals and humans. Testing is ongoing. Blakowksi is growing cabbage in a laboratory and sprinkling the plants with dust samples from the Great Salt Lake to see how much arsenic they take up.

In California, ratepayers have spent about $2.5 billion controlling dust emissions on Owens Lake, which was drained by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power only to become the biggest humanmade source of dust in the U.S..

Researchers say the Great Salt Lake represents a much larger threat.

“The area of currently exposed lakebed is over seven times larger than the entire area of Owens Lake,” Blakowski said, adding that the population downwind is about 50 times larger in Utah’s case. “We can’t wait. It’s just going to keep getting dustier and there are serious human health and ecosystem implications if we sit on this too long.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/salt-lake-citys-efforts-fight-pollution-face-new-challenge-toxic-dust-rcna44508,2022-12-07T14:00:19+00:00
253,"Ye’s Yeezy clothing brand owes California $600,000, according to state tax liens","The rapper Ye has been vocal about his personal financial struggles and debts. In 2016, before he became a billionaire, he said he was $53 million in debt, and in the last month, he’s claimed that four of his personal accounts have been frozen over claims of tax debt.

Now, government records reviewed by NBC News show that at least one of his businesses may also have six-figure debt issues.

The records, a series of state tax lien notices from the last two years, show the state of California claiming that Yeezy Apparel, a company managed and reportedly owned by Ye, owes over $600,000 in unpaid tax debt. Three separate notice letters were sent in July 2021, in February and in September. A lien is a claim made on a person or entity’s assets in response to an alleged debt.

The alleged debts add to a growing portrait of chaos surrounding Ye and his businesses, which has been described by former associates and Ye himself in recent weeks. Forbes recently removed Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, from its billionaires list, citing his terminated business deals.

Four tax law experts said the amount owed by Yeezy Apparel is significant and could be a sign of deeper issues at the company.

“Multiple California tax liens, adding up to $600,000, that’s certainly a sign of either extreme incompetence or extreme cash problems,” said USC Gould School of Law Professor Edward McCaffery, who specializes in tax law. “That is kind of an Amber Alert for the financial health of the enterprise.”

According to the state of California’s government website, a lien may be imposed if a company or taxpayer doesn’t respond to their letters about taxes owed, pay in full or set a payment plan.

Yeezy Apparel has been operating in California since 2017, according to public California business records, and was recorded as being active and in “good” standing in an annual filing in January. Yeezy is Ye’s core fashion and lifestyle brand, known for its tumultuous collaborations with Adidas and Gap, both of which have been terminated over his antisemitic remarks. Yeezy Apparel is one of five active Yeezy limited liability corporations in California managed by Ye. In 2019, Forbes reported in a profile of Ye that he owned 100 percent of Yeezy. A year later, Yeezy took over $2.3 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans.

Lynn LoPucki, a professor of law at the University of Florida who specializes in secured transactions and bankruptcy research, said the liens also raise questions about California’s debt collection policies.

“The state is subject to some criticism for just sitting on this when there is a going business there from which they could collect,” he said.

Representatives for Ye and for Yeezy did not respond to a request for comment.

An NBC News investigation uncovered accounts from former colleagues who said Ye would use antisemitic language in the workplace and praise Hitler. The report unearthed a settlement agreement and payment between Ye and a former colleague that came after allegations of such comments.

On Monday, Ye painted his own picture of the financial chaos that he says he’s living with, telling the far-right podcast host Tim Pool that four of his bank accounts had been frozen on a $75 million hold, and that he was told by his accountants that morning that he owes $50 million in taxes.

The Internal Revenue Service said, “Federal law prohibits the IRS from commenting on or confirming anything related to private taxpayer matters.”

While the amount said to be owed by Yeezy Apparel is just a fraction of the multimillion-dollar figures cited by Ye himself, the liens fit into a pattern found among his other businesses.

NBC News found 17 government-imposed liens in California against three of Ye’s businesses and a charity created in his name dating back as far back as 2012. Four of the liens were labeled active with no indication of them having been terminated or paid.

“Tax lien indicates that the state maintains that a debt is owing to the state,” LoPucki said. The majority of the liens reviewed by NBC News were issued by the California Employment Development Department.

A representative for the department said it could not comment on taxpayer information.

Four experts who reviewed the liens agreed that they most likely pertained to payroll taxes, given that the department oversees payroll taxes and unemployment in the state.

“Those would be things like unemployment insurance and state disability insurance taxes, things like that,” said Kirk Stark, the Barrall Family Professor of Tax Law and Policy at UCLA School of Law.

It’s not clear what chain of events led to the liens being filed, but the four experts agreed that a lien being imposed indicates that there were most likely previous communications between the state and Yeezy Apparel that would allow the company to resolve or challenge the debts before a lien was imposed.

“They’ve gotten pretty serious before a lien is imposed usually. This is not the first step of a tax enforcement agency,” said David Gamage, a professor of law specializing in taxes at Indiana University Bloomington.

“Consistently ignoring communications from the EDD would eventually be a basis for the department to just say, ‘OK, well then you know, we’re going to file this lien, and you know, set this in motion,’” Stark said, using an abbreviation for the Employment Development Department.

Of the liens listed as active with no indication of termination, the earliest is from the tax year 2020.

The experts who spoke with NBC News said the liens could be indicative of several larger business concerns.

“If you’re screwing up on this, you’ve got bigger problems and there’s probably other things you’re not paying,” said McCaffery. “But on the other hand, it could be consistent with just kind of a bare-bones operation that’s a little sloppy.”

It’s not clear what the future of the Yeezy brand and its associated companies looks like following the termination of the Adidas deal.

According to Forbes, which reportedly saw internal Yeezy documentation in the process of assessing Ye’s billionaire status, the Yeezy brand was “functionally tied” to Adidas during the period of their contract.

After the termination of the deal, Adidas said on an earnings call that it would continue to sell Yeezy designs under different branding.

“Let me be clear, we own all the IP, we own all the designs, we own all the versions and new colorways,” Harm Ohlmeyer, chief financial officer of Adidas, said.

Zak Kurtz, co-founder and CEO of the law firm Sneaker & Streetwear Legal Services, said the paths forward for Yeezy as a viable business are limited given Adidas’ ownership of much of Yeezy’s intellectual property.

“What he can use is what he has, you know, his trademarks, and any new designs or any new stuff that he comes up with,” Kurtz said. “And I think that’s really where the brand has to go — in my opinion, they’d have to create new stuff.”

Kenneth Anand, co-author of the sneaker legal and business book “Sneaker Law,” added that the company could pursue another partnership with a major brand.

“It could align with a new licensee, perhaps one that can offer the same type of products and services that the Gap and/or Adidas did, although it seems unlikely that any companies would be willing to take a risk on a volatile brand and designer such as Ye,” Anand, who has also worked as the head of business development and general counsel for Yeezy, wrote in a text message.

Anand said he could only comment on the company from the perspective of an industry expert, and noted that consumers had begun to turn on Ye.

“Ye’s recent statements have clearly hurt the Yeezy brand,” Anand wrote. “Consumers are openly declaring that they will no longer support and wear Yeezy, even if they have spent a considerable amount of money on the brand’s products.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/taxes/kanye-west-yeezy-ye-debt-tax-finances-money-net-worth-rcna58980,2022-12-07T13:00:33+00:00
254,Ye's online fan communities reckon with rapper's praise of Hitler in recent Infowars interview,"Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, has left a sprawling fandom and network of dedicated creators in limbo after he praised Adolf Hitler and Nazis.

After Ye’s Dec. 1 appearance on far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ website Infowars, social media exploded with clips of the artist’s comments about Hitler. It prompted many of Ye’s supporters on Reddit, Twitter and Instagram to denounce him, with some distancing themselves entirely and others temporarily pausing posting. Some continue to post despite the backlash, in hopes that the fandom will not completely die out.

Moderators of the subreddit /r/WestSubEver, one of the biggest Reddit pages about Ye, told their 119,000 members in a post that they were “closing the sub for the foreseeable future.” The description for the subreddit has been changed to “Welcome to r/WestSubEver, formerly dedicated to news, theories, and discussions about disgraced artist & neo-nazi Kanye West.”

Reddit user CalmYe, a moderator for /r/WestSubEver who requested anonymity due to fears of harassment, said that the moderation team unanimously agreed to close the subreddit.

“After the Infowars interview, we were disgusted by his behavior,” CalmYe said. “We didn’t want to give a platform to what he’s saying anymore.”

After the Infowars interview, we were disgusted by his behavior. We didn’t want to give a platform to what he’s saying anymore."" -Reddit user CalmYe, a moderator for /r/WestSubEver

Over the past two months, CalmYe said the community became “hell” due to a sudden influx of alt-right members joining the page and posting hate speech. The subreddit became increasingly difficult to moderate, and Ye’s praise of Hitler was the tipping point.

CalmYe said the mods won’t be deleting /r/WestSubEver. They plan on keeping the page closed for at least a month.

The team is currently planning to use the page to post occasional music news from Ye, with limitations on members’ comments. CalmYe said there are still fans who are interested in Ye’s music who have chosen to separate art from the artist.

The moderators decided to rebrand their group on the chat app Discord, and they started polling members on what they wanted as an alternative topic. CalmYe also said members started channels in Discord to educate each other on antisemitism and Holocaust facts.

CalmYe said most fans seem “disgusted” with Ye’s recent behavior, and this latest interview caused many to ditch the artist for good. CalmYe said it has been difficult to watch his community fall apart in recent days.

“We had a very tight knit community. ... We had a lot of memes. We had a lot of, you know, regular users. We had, of course, the moderators, and it’s just kind of depressing,” he said.

Meanwhile, members of the /r/Kanye subreddit, which has over 712,000 members, appeared to debate their options. Some members called on moderators to “close the sub,” while others hoped there could be a way to save the community.

On Friday, the subreddit was full of Taylor Swift memes and members posting about trading the Ye fandom for Swiftie status, a reference to Ye and Swift’s yearslong feud following the 2009 Video Music Awards. Others posted recommendations for educational materials about the Holocaust and stated the page should become a Holocaust remembrance subreddit.

Reddit user avayr44, a moderator for /r/Kanye, said there are no plans to close the subreddit. Avayr44, who requested anonymity due to fears of harassment, said the page would remain accessible for fans who want to process Ye’s recent behavior.

“For a lot of people, this Reddit is a way to get closure with like-minded people who grew up with Kanye and are disappointed in his latest behavior,” he said.

In regard to supporting the rapper, avayr44 said the decision to separate the art from the artist is a personal decision for each fan to make. The future of the subreddit is dependent on what the community wants, avayr44 said, and the mods will “respond accordingly.”

On Twitter, Chris Lambert, co-host of the Ye-themed podcast “Watching the Throne,” said that the podcast and corresponding YouTube channel were ending following the Infowars interview. Previously, Lambert said on his website that “Watching the Throne” was the No. 1 Ye podcast, with more than 100,000 downloads a month.

“This account will probably never tweet about Ye ever again. The podcast is done. The YouTube channel will be rebranded. Appreciate y’all for the support over the years. And for all continued support and connection,” Lambert tweeted. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other Ye-focused creators have tried to steer their followings through the aftermath of the Infowars interview.

Emilie Hagen, a comedian who runs an Instagram page documenting Ye’s posts, said it’s been tricky to navigate Ye’s hard-right turn into politics. She started “kanyesposts,” an archive that reposts everything Ye posts on Instagram among other appearances and interviews, in February 2022. Her account has over 126,000 followers and is currently set to private.

“In the beginning it was a lot more fun because I was just documenting him calling Pete Davidson ‘Skete,’ and then we got into this new political territory and I’m like ‘OK, this is not what I signed up for,’” Hagen said. She called the week of Ye’s Infowars interview the “worst week yet.”

Hagen hasn’t pivoted her page away from Ye yet, but said she has spent the days following his Infowars interview “fending off trolls, trying to keep the peace amongst a divided fanbase, and making disclaimers on the IG story to keep everyone calm.”

“I’m basically his unpaid publicist at this point,” she added. Hagen, who was a fan of Ye’s, said she isn’t sure his reputation will be able to recover. But she said she’s continuing her role as an archivist of his social media posts. The account’s bio says, “We do not endorse every opinion Ye presents.”

In recent months, brands and former collaborators have cut ties with Ye over his antisemitic remarks. Adidas and Gap both cited antisemitism in their statements about parting ways with Ye, while Balenciaga and Ye’s former agency CAA were reported to have dropped him after Ye made antisemitic posts on Instagram and Twitter in October.

The statement added that the group was motivated by a rejection of the ""free democratic basic order of the Federal Republic of Germany.""

Some member’s the group’s “military arm” are former members of the German army, the Bundeswehr, prosecutors said. The German armed forces have been beset by a series of scandals involving personnel belonging to far-right groups.

A spokesman for the German Military Security Service confirmed to NBC News that “an active member of the military’s special forces (KSK) group” was also under investigation. But the spokesman stressed that he is not part of the special forces itself and would not confirm whether the suspect was arrested.

The group is heavily influenced by right-wing conspiracy theories, authorities say, including a belief in a secretive, malign ""deep state"" running the country as seen in the QAnon movement. It believes that the Federal Republic of Germany is not a sovereign state and its members espouse antisemitic conspiracy theories, Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution said.

Reichsbürger activists and members of other closely-related groups commonly take part in protests against Covid-19 restrictions. The pandemic was a rallying cause for far-right actors across Europe, adding to baseless accusations of a wider government plot to control citizens.

Prosecutors also said the group believes that ""the Alliance,"" a group of national governments and intelligence services, including those of the United States and Russia, is active in Germany and about to launch an attack on the ""deep state.""

Germany’s domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), has been officially observing the “Reichsbürger” scene since 2016. The agency counts around 21,000 followers, according to its website, with a little more than a thousand of them also considered right-wing extremists.

Authorities said among those arrested was ""Heinrich XIII P. R,"" named in German media as Prince Heinrich XIII of the House of Reuss, which ruled parts of Germany until 1918. NBC News has not verified his identity.

He is considered to be a future head of state after an insurrection and he heads the group's ruling council which has met to discuss the planned takeover, prosecutors said.

Prince Heinrich, who still uses his title despite its constitutional irrelevance, is accused of contacting representatives of the Russian Federation both in Russia and Germany in the hope of winning support for the overthrow of the Berlin government.

One suspect was also arrested was in Perugia, Italy, while another was in Kitzbühel, Austria. A Russian national named as Vitalia B. is accused of helping the organization attempt to contact Russian officials.

German prosecutors note, however, that there is no evidence Russian officials reacted positively to the request.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in his daily news briefing on Wednesday that the investigation was ""an internal matter for Germany, and they themselves state there is no question of Russian interference.""

256,FBI asking about videos and racist website in connection with Colorado shooting,"The FBI is asking about two websites in connection with last month’s shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado that left five dead and 17 others injured, a former neighbor and friend of the suspect told NBC News.

The former neighbor, Xavier Kraus, said an FBI agent asked him about the two websites at an FBI field office in Colorado Springs last Thursday afternoon after an agent called him earlier that day.

One of the websites, Kraus said he told investigators, was created by Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, who was charged Tuesday with 305 criminal counts, including first-degree murder and bias-motivated crimes, in the mass shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs shortly before midnight on Nov. 19. Aldrich was subdued by three club patrons shortly after the shooting began and was then arrested by authorities.

The website allegedly created by Aldrich is a forum-type “free speech” site where people have anonymously posted racist and antisemitic memes, language and videos.

A video on the homepage titled “Wrong Targets” advocates for killing civilians as part of a larger effort to “assassinate the elites at the top” and “cleanse” society.

A link on the homepage that reads “Visit Our Brother Site!” directs to a webpage with links to four short videos, each uploaded in two different formats, that appear to have been posted in the hours leading up to the shooting.

Two of the videos show the inside of a Toyota at night; in one, the dashboard clock reads 11:44, and the person recording the video says “OK” before ending it. Local police began receiving 911 calls about a shooting at Club Q at 11:56 p.m.

The videos appear to have gone up from 9:28 p.m. to 11:43 p.m. local time on the night of the shooting. While it is unclear who recorded and posted the videos, one frame in the 11:44 video shows a reflection in the rearview mirror that resembles Aldrich.

A screengrab taken from one of the four videos shows a reflection in the car’s rear-view mirror that resembles Aldrich. Obtained by NBC News

The “brother site” previously hosted video of the mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in May that left 10 people dead, according to an archive of the page that was viewed by NBC News. Links to the site were quickly shared on the extremist sites 4chan and 8kun (formerly 8chan) in the days after the shooting, where the site and video were discussed.

Public defenders representing Aldrich, who is being held without bond, didn’t immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment.

A spokesperson for the FBI’s Denver field office said, “The Denver FBI Field Office, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, National Security Division, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado are aware of the situation regarding the shooting in Colorado Springs at Club Q, and we will review all available facts of the incident to determine what federal response is warranted.” The Colorado Springs police department didn’t return a request for comment.

Kraus, who, according to public records, lived one door away from Aldrich in a Colorado Springs apartment complex, said he told the FBI that Aldrich made the free speech website in late spring or early summer. Kraus said Aldrich described the site as “a platform where people could go and post pretty much whatever they want.”

“At the time, I was like, OK, I can kind of get behind that, I guess, not really realizing what it was going to actually turn into,” Kraus said. He added that he and Aldrich — whose attorneys have said is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns — visited the site together at Aldrich’s apartment about two or three times after the site was live, and that Aldrich once said they had forgotten to moderate the content added by others.

Kraus said that most of the posts currently on the site, including the racist content, were not there when he visited it with Aldrich. A message at the top of the site’s homepage states, “There are two Rules. NO CP and NO SPAMMING,” with “CP” presumably referring to child pornography.

Kraus said the agents asked whether Aldrich posted the “Wrong Targets” video on the homepage. Kraus said he told them that the video’s placement on the site “was something that only an admin could do.” He knew this because he had previously visited the site with Aldrich, but he was unable to confirm that Aldrich was the one to post the video.

The FBI also asked Kraus about the “brother site” that included the video links and whether he knew anything about it or what was on it, he said. Kraus said an agent unsuccessfully tried to access that site on a laptop while Kraus was at the field office, and a subsequent text message between Kraus and the agent also shows the agent was unable to open it at the time.

One of the four videos appears to quickly pan around the inside of an apartment. Kraus confirmed that the apartment shown was the apartment that Aldrich had lived in with their mother when Aldrich and Kraus were neighbors.

One of the videos is completely black throughout, and the two videos recorded inside the vehicle are dark, but some details can be made out. In one of the vehicle videos, the person recording says, “Shoutout to professional seven sins,” and the car dashboard clock reads 10:06.

After listening to the voice in the videos, Kraus said it “sounds very, very similar” to Aldrich, but he could not confirm this with certainty.

When asked about the “professional seven sins” remark, Kraus said that he and Aldrich were both familiar with an online community called Se7en Sins Gaming Community, but Kraus didn’t know the meaning of the remark. One of the administrators of this online community goes by the name “Professional.”

If this remark was meant to refer to the online gaming community and is tied to the alleged Club Q gunman, it would not be the first time such a reference was made by a mass shooter. Brenton Tarrant, who in 2019 shot and killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, said during a livestream of the shootings, “subscribe to PewDiePie,” a reference to a viral meme about a popular YouTuber who posted videos of himself playing video games. A livestream of the shooting was posted to 8chan, eventually leading to the site’s ban in New Zealand and rebranding to 8kun.

Less than one month later, a shooter at the Poway Synagogue in California posted a largely identical manifesto to the Christchurch shooter on 8chan shortly before the attack. Investigators said the shooter tried and failed to set up a livestream of the shooting.

Kraus said that he has felt a “tremendous amount of guilt” since the Club Q shooting. He said that he did not challenge Aldrich when they made racist or homophobic statements, including stating that they “hate faggots,” because Aldrich was “an angry person” who also owned guns.

“I know that this wasn’t something that I did, but, I don’t know how to explain it, I feel absolutely horrible knowing that I knew somebody and got to know somebody and made friends with somebody that could go in and do this horrible thing,” Kraus said. “There’s some nights I just cry, because it could have been me, it could have been, who knows what could have happened — it’s just terrifying.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/fb-asking-videos-racist-website-connection-colorado-shooting-rcna60188,2022-12-06T22:04:07.634000+00:00
257,Wooden ship from 1800s uncovered on Florida beach after erosion caused by recent hurricanes,"DAYTONA BEACH SHORES, Fla. — Severe beach erosion from two late-season hurricanes has helped uncover what appears to be a wooden ship dating from the 1800s which had been buried under the sand on Florida’s East Coast for up to two centuries, impervious to cars that drove daily on the beach or sand castles built by generations of tourists.

Beachgoers and lifeguards discovered the wooden structure, between 80 feet to 100 feet, poking out of the sand over Thanksgiving weekend in front of homes that collapsed into rubble on Daytona Beach Shores last month from Hurricane Nicole.

“Whenever you find a shipwreck on the beach it’s really an amazing occurrence. There’s this mystery, you know. It’s not there one day, and it’s there the next day, so it really captivates the imagination,” said maritime archaeologist Chuck Meide, who on Tuesday led an archeological team from St. Augustine, Florida to examine the beach find.

Hurricane Ian made landfall in late September on Florida’s southwest coast and exited into the Atlantic Ocean over central Florida. Nicole devastated much of Volusia County’s coastline in early November, leaving behind homes collapsed into the ocean after they had been made vulnerable to erosion from Ian.

“It’s a rare experience, but it’s not unique, and it seems with climate change and more intense hurricane seasons, it’s happening more frequently,” Meide said of the discovery.

The archeological team on Monday and Tuesday removed sand and made a shallow trench around the structure’s wooden timbers, took measurements and made sketches in an effort to solve the 200-year mystery. The digging team members went from using shovels to trowels and then their hands as more of the frame was exposed, so as not to damage any of the wood.

“It’s going a lot quicker today but it does take a lot of time,” said Arielle Cathers, one of the members of the team, as she kneeled in the sand around the trench unearthing parts of the timber frame with a trowel. “You want to go really carefully.”

Meide, who serves as the director of the research arm of St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum in Florida, said he is convinced the structure is a shipwreck because of how it was constructed and the materials such as iron bolts that were used.

It’s not unusual for items to wash up, or become uncovered along beaches, after storms. In Martin County, which is about 160 miles south of Volusia County, the skeletal remains of six people believed to be from a Native American burial ground were unearthed by Nicole’s wind and waves. A historical steamer-style trunk and other items also washed onto beaches.

After the initial discovery two weeks ago, sand from waves reburied the ship’s timbers that had become visible on Daytona Shores Beach. Members of the archeological team this week don’t intend to uncover the entire length of the ship, but merely enough to measure it, draw it and possibly take some wood samples to test for its origins.

There are no plans to remove the ship from Daytona Beach Shores, not only because the cost would likely run in the millions of dollars, but because it’s protected where it is, packed into the wet sand, Meide said.

“We will let Mother Nature bury the wreck,” he said. “That will help preserve it. As long as that hull is in the dark and wet, it will last a very long time, hundreds of more years.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wooden-ship-1800s-uncovered-florida-beach-beach-erosion-caused-recent-rcna60517,2022-12-07T14:21:56.846000+00:00
258,"Polygamous leader in Arizona had more than 20 ‘wives,’ including children, feds say","A “self-proclaimed prophet” had more than 20 wives, including minors, and said it was the “Heavenly Father’s will” he participate in sex acts with them, according to an FBI affidavit.

Samuel Rappylee Bateman, of Colorado City, Arizona, said it was the will of God to encourage his followers, “including the minor children, to engage in sexual acts,"" according to the affidavit filed Friday in federal court in the Eastern District of Washington.

Bateman was the leader of a branch of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the affidavit said.

The affidavit was filed one day after authorities tracked down eight girls — who had been under Bateman's care but were placed in state custody in Arizona — to an Airbnb in Washington state. The girls had escaped from their group homes in Arizona, the affidavit said.

On Sept. 14, nine girls were taken into custody with the Arizona Department of Child Services, according to the affidavit. None of them “disclosed actual sexual abuse by Bateman, but at least one admitted being present and partially nude” for sex orgies, the affidavit said.

Eight of the nine girls on Nov. 27 ran away from group homes where they were in state custody, according to the affidavit.

On Thursday, a sergeant with the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office spotted a vehicle driven by one of Bateman’s wives in which all eight of the missing girls were passengers, the affidavit said.

The affidavit named Bateman’s wife as a defendant in the ongoing criminal case for kidnapping and obstruction.

Bateman has not been charged with sex crimes, although the affidavit said there is probable cause he participated in sexual activity with minors who were transported between Arizona, Utah, Nevada and Nebraska in 2020 and 2021.

Lawyers for Bateman could not be immediately reached Tuesday.

A defendant named in the affidavit became one of Bateman’s wives when she was under 18. She gave birth seven months after she turned 18, the affidavit said. She is accused of kidnapping and obstruction along with two other women, the affidavit said.

In 2019, Bateman began to proclaim he was a prophet translated from Warren Jeffs, who Bateman and his followers referred to as “Uncle Warren,” the affidavit said.

In 2019, Bateman was married to one woman and had a daughter who had been born in 2005, the affidavit said.

The woman left Bateman and that's when he began accumulating wives, the affidavit said.

Some of the information provided to an FBI agent in the affidavit came from two people, a woman who Bateman believed was trying to help members of his group, and her husband, who was filming a documentary.

In December 2020, Bateman drove to the couple’s home in Colorado City “in a large SUV packed with women and girls. Bateman introduced everyone as his wives,” the affidavit said. The youngest of the girls was born in 2011, according to the affidavit.

A minor related to Bateman was interviewed on video in December 2020, according to the affidavit. A review of the video determined Bateman asked the minor if she prayed about who she was going to marry. The girl responded she hadn’t because she was too young. Bateman then told her, the affidavit said, he “felt like she was his wife.”

The girl also told investigators Bateman had hugged and kissed her and one of the kisses was a “nasty kiss” she described as “slobbery.”

The affidavit said investigators had also secured other evidence in the form of journals from some of Bateman’s wives, according to the FBI agent who wrote the affidavit.

“I have reviewed a number of the journals seized during the search warrants, and there are details referenced by several of the girls about sleeping with Bateman, kissing him, and touching him,” the affidavit said.

Bateman was 46 in September when he was arrested following a separate indictment on charges of destroying records in a federal investigation.

The federal charges allege destruction of records or an attempt to destroy records in an official proceeding; tampering or attempting to tamper with an official proceeding; and destruction of records in a federal investigation, authorities have said.

That indictment alleges that on Aug. 28, Bateman destroyed or attempted to destroy records, by deleting or aiding and abetting others to delete, electronic communications associated with Signal accounts, prosecutors said. Signal is an encrypted messaging application. The indictment also alleged that Bateman did so in order to obstruct, influence, and impede an investigation and prosecution in federal court.

Bateman was using Signal to communicate with his wives and followers, prosecutors said.Bateman has pleaded not guilty.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/polygamous-leader-arizona-20-wives-children-feds-say-rcna60319,2022-12-06T23:42:38.609000+00:00
259,"New York man charged with hate crime after allegedly targeting Jewish father and son in BB gun attack, police say","A New York man was arrested and charged on Tuesday after allegedly firing a BB gun at a Jewish father and son who were out grocery shopping over the weekend, police said.

Jason Kish, 25, of Staten Island, was charged with assault as a hate crime, endangering the welfare of a child, reckless endangerment and assault in connection with the incident, which unfolded on Sunday afternoon, the New York City Police Department said.

The victims, a 32-year-old father and his 7-year-old son, had been standing in front of a Kosher grocery store on Staten Island and were wearing yarmulkes when they were hit with BB gun pellets on Sunday afternoon, the NYPD said.

In video of the incident shared online by the Staten Island Shomrim Safety Patrol, the father and son can be seen appearing to put a shopping cart away outside the Island Kosher supermarket when a black Ford Mustang with at least one window rolled down drives by.

The boy can be seen grabbing his ear as he appears to be struck by a BB gun pellet, as the father appears to turn around to see what happened.

The NYPD's 121st precinct had released a photo of the black Ford Mustang on Twitter, saying its driver was wanted for two counts of assault as a hate crime.

It was not immediately clear whether Kish has obtained an attorney. NBC News has reached out to a social media account appearing to belong to Kish.

On Tuesday, the precinct announced that the suspect wanted for the BB gun assault had been apprehended.

Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said he feared the young boy allegedly targeted in the shooting would ""never walk that street again without thinking about that incident.""

“We are not going to allow hate to run our city,” Adams said, noting that there has been a ""substantial increase in hate crimes, particularly antisemitism, across the country,"" including in New York, which he said has the largest Jewish population outside of Israel.

“We need to stop what’s happening on social media, we need to stop the spreading of this hate, we need to combat it in a very real way,” he said.

Reports of antisemitic incidents in the U.S. hit record highs last year, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents since 1979.

Antisemitic rhetoric has become especially prominent in recent weeks after Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, made a series of antisemitic remarks on social media and praised Hitler in an hourslong interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

The White House announced on Monday that a roundtable hosted by second gentleman Doug Emhoff would be convened Wednesday to discuss the rise of antisemitism and efforts to counter hate across the country.

The roundtable is expected to include White House Domestic Policy Adviser Susan Rice; Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism; and Keisha Lance Bottoms, senior adviser to the president for public engagement.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-york-man-charged-hate-crime-allegedly-targeting-jewish-father-son-rcna60484,2022-12-07T12:38:58.740000+00:00
260,Woman who watched boyfriend kill 6 of his family members in Chicago robbery sentenced to 25 years in prison,"CHICAGO — A woman who watched her former boyfriend kill six members of his family, including two young boys, at their Chicago home then helped him steal their property was sentenced Tuesday to 25 years in prison.

Jafeth Ramos, 25, pleaded guilty to armed robbery under a deal with Cook County prosecutors in which she agreed to testify against the former boyfriend, Diego Uribe Cruz, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

Uribe Cruz was sentenced to life in prison last month for six counts of first-degree murder in the February 2016 slayings in the victims’ bungalow in the Gage Park neighborhood on the city’s Southwest Side.

At Uribe Cruz’s trial, Ramos told jurors that she accepted the plea agreement in the hope that she one day would be able to again be with her son, who was barely a toddler when the couple were arrested in May 2016.

During that trial, prosecutors alleged he shot his 32-year-old aunt, Maria Martinez, after trying to rob her on Feb. 4, 2016, before he fatally stabbed her sons, ages 10 and 13, and stabbed or beat to death other relatives to make sure there were no witnesses.

Ramos declined to give a statement at her sentencing hearing.

As she was led out of the room, Ramos waved to family members in the gallery and made a heart shape with her hands. The family declined to comment afterwards.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/woman-watched-boyfriend-kill-6-family-members-chicago-robbery-sentence-rcna60483,2022-12-07T10:13:32.416000+00:00
261,Former CBP agent accused of sexually assaulting a minor was caught on video threatening his accuser,"A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent accused of kidnapping and repeatedly sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl in Arizona was caught on police video saying what appears to be a threat against his accuser.

Aaron Thomas Mitchell, 27, made the incriminating remark after his arrest in April, when local detectives left him alone in an interrogation room without turning off the video recorder, according to federal court documents.

“I cannot believe this s---,” Mitchell, who worked for CBP for 10 months and who is the son of two retired Florida police officers, could be heard saying, according to federal court papers. “F------- little b—-. B—-- is claiming rape. That’s so f—--- crazy. That’s crazy, man. She better hope I don’t get out of here.”

Aaron Thomas Mitchell. U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona

Mitchell’s federal public defenders concede that he “muttered” the statement but insisted in court papers that “there is no evidence that this was a genuine threat.”

“In context, it was clear that he was upset and processing the arrest,” they said. “Indeed, when released into Arizona for two weeks before returning to Florida, he did nothing to contact the alleged victim or her family.”

Mitchell, who had been indicted in April on 18 state charges, now faces three federal charges: a civil rights violation for sexually assaulting a minor; kidnapping a minor; and misleading state investigators, according to a superseding indictment issued by the Department of Justice.

If convicted on the federal charges, Mitchell faces anywhere from 20 years to life in prison, a $250,000 fine and could be placed under supervised parole for the rest of his life, the Department of Justice said in a statement on Nov. 30, when the superseding indictment was unsealed.

Mitchell was ordered to remain in custody until his trial. When he was arraigned on the state charges months earlier, he posted bond and was allowed to live at his parents’ Miami home under electronic monitoring. He was taken back into custody in August when he was federally indicted on one count of kidnapping a minor, after which a federal judge ordered that he remain in detention.

“If Mitchell was bold enough to kidnap a girl near her school, depraved enough to violently and sexually assault her, cunning enough to dispose of incriminating evidence, and careless enough to threaten her while in police custody, then none of Mitchell’s proposed conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the community and the victim,” prosecutors argued in court papers filed Nov. 10.

Mitchell worked for the CBP at a border post in Douglas, Arizona, according to the court papers. CBP would only confirm that Mitchell is no longer employed with the department.

In a statement released on April 28 to the Tucson Sentinel, CBP said, “We do not tolerate corruption or abuse within our ranks, and we cooperate fully with all criminal or administrative investigations of alleged misconduct by any of our personnel, whether it occurs on or off duty.”

At the time they referred all questions to the Douglas Police Department.

On April 25, Mitchell was wearing a vest emblazoned with the word “POLICE” on it when he spotted the alleged victim, who lives in Mexico but crossed the border into the U.S. regularly to attend high school in Douglas, prosecutors said in court papers.

Douglas is about two hours southeast of Tucson, Ariz.

Driving up in his personal car, Mitchell asked the teenager to present her papers, took her backpack and “ordered her into the car so he could take her to a police station,” according to Mitchell’s October appeal of the pre-trial detention order.

But after handcuffing her, Mitchell allegedly “asked her age and family’s names, and drove her to his apartment an hour away in Sierra Vista, Arizona,” according to the court document.

There, Mitchell “made her stay in the car while he retrieved a jacket, placed the jacket over her shoulders to hide the handcuffs before he walked her inside,” the court papers state.

Once inside, according to the papers, Mitchell “told her to do as instructed if she did not want to get hurt” and “repeatedly sexually assaulted her.”

Several hours later, Mitchell drove the teenager back to Douglas and falsely identified himself as a Sierra Vista police officer. He tossed her backpack into a dumpster, the court papers state.

The victim reported the alleged assault the next day and Mitchell was taken into custody. Mitchell “gave a recorded post-arrest statement in which he admitted to taking the girl to his apartment to skip school but said they only watched television.” He also said he recognized the girl “from her prior border crossings,” according to the court papers.

Although Mitchell denied assaulting the teenager, “DNA recovered from the girl’s genitalia was consistent with Mitchell’s DNA,” the papers state.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-cbp-agent-accused-sexually-assaulting-minor-was-caught-video-th-rcna60222,2022-12-07T02:04:25.081000+00:00
262,Fellow officer says Aaron Dean did not mention gun before fatal shooting of Black woman,"The police partner of a former Fort Worth, Texas, officer on trial for murder in the 2019 death of Atatiana Jefferson testified Tuesday that Aaron Dean never said he saw someone with a firearm the night he shot and killed Jefferson in her home.

Officer Carol Darch and Dean had been responding to a call at Jefferson’s home when Dean, who is white, fatally shot Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman who was playing video games with her 8-year-old nephew.

During questioning from the prosecution, Darch testified that Dean never said the word “gun” or that he saw someone with a firearm before he shot her or after they went inside and searched the home.

Darch said Dean took the lead as they approached the house and moved toward Jefferson’s backyard. She said the two of them thought they might be at the scene of a burglary and did not announce themselves.

Dean and Darch went to the home after a concerned neighbor noticed a door had been left ajar and called a nonemergency police line. Jefferson, according to court documents, was up late that night playing video games and caring for her 8-year-old nephew, Zion Carr. According to police and body camera footage, Dean failed to identify himself before firing his weapon and striking Jefferson.

Dean pleaded not guilty Monday to the murder charge.

Zion, who is now 11, testified Monday that the screen doors were open after he and his aunt burned hamburgers they had planned to eat for dinner. The two then continued to play video games into the night.

Zion said his aunt pulled out her gun and kept it at her side after hearing noises outside, both of them unaware police had been called to the home.

Darch said when she turned around she did not see Jefferson's gun and could only see Jefferson’s face in the window with “eyes as big as saucers.”

Darch said that when they went into the room where Jefferson had been shot, she saw Zion crying and wrapped him in a blanket and took him outside.

“I heard the baby and that became my sole focus,” she said.

Darch cried as she spoke about being concerned for the boy’s well-being and asked the judge to pause her testimony.

Dean’s lawyers have said Dean acted reasonably while responding to what he believed might have been a burglary in progress.

James Smith, the neighbor who called police that night, also testified Tuesday and said he had received a call from his family members around 2 a.m. expressing concern for his neighbors because they had seen a front door and a side door open at Jefferson’s house.

Smith said he called the nonemergency line and not 911 because he was not sure what was happening.

""It did not appear to be an emergency,” he said.

Smith said it was “devastating” to learn Jefferson had been shot by police and that he lives with the consequences of his phone call and Jefferson’s death “every day, every day.” He said he feels “somewhat” responsible for it.

Dean's attorneys asked Smith whether there was crime in the neighborhood, and he said that while there were problems in part of it, the area where he lives was safe.

“It could be less. It should be less than what it is,” he said, referring to how much crime is in the neighborhood.

Jefferson’s death echoes that of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman fatally shot by police in 2020 in her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment. Both shootings led to widespread criticism and prompted calls for police accountability and racial justice in law enforcement.

During opening statements Monday, prosecutors said Jefferson’s death was “an unjustifiable act that never should’ve happened.”

Dean’s attorney, Miles Brissette, said during opening statements that Dean saw a gun being raised, gave the command and fired.

Dean, who resigned from the Fort Worth Police Department before his arrest, was indicted by a Texas grand jury in December 2019 on a murder charge.

263,Supreme Court weighs North Carolina dispute that could upend election law,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear a major case that could upend election law as the justices consider whether to reinstate Republican-drawn congressional districts in North Carolina.

The appeal brought by North Carolina Republicans asks the justices to embrace a hitherto obscure legal argument called the “independent state legislature” theory, which could strip state courts of the power to strike down certain election laws enacted by state legislatures.

The theory has been embraced by supporters of former President Donald Trump, who cited it during various cases during the 2020 presidential election and its aftermath.

The case, which could have a broad impact on an array of election issues, is being closely watched for its potential impact on the 2024 presidential election.

Republicans led by Tim Moore, the Republican speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, invoked the theory after the state Supreme Court in February struck down the congressional district map.

The state court ruled that the 14 congressional districts — drawn by Republicans to maximize the influence of Republican voters in a state strongly contested by both main parties — were “unlawful partisan gerrymanders.” The court, which then had a liberal majority, said the maps violated various state constitutional provisions, one of which requires that “all elections be free.”

Voting rights advocates and Democratic voters had turned to the state court after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that partisan gerrymandering claims could not be heard in federal court but left open the possibility that state courts could address the issue.

Moore and other Republicans immediately asked the Supreme Court to reinstate the maps, saying the state court had overstepped its authority. The high court agreed to take up the case, but it left in place a replacement map used for this year’s midterm elections. Democrats and Republicans each won seven seats.

The independent state legislature argument hinges on language in the Constitution that says election rules “shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.”

Supporters of the theory, which has never been endorsed by the Supreme Court, say the language supports the notion that, when it comes to federal election rules, legislatures have ultimate power under state law, potentially irrespective of potential constraints imposed by state constitutions.

In addition to being raised by Trump and his allies in 2020, the theory also arose in the 2000 presidential election during the litigation in Florida that ultimately led to Republican President George W. Bush’s taking office.

The Supreme Court in 2020 refused to intervene in the various election-related cases that raised the theory, but during the litigation four conservative justices indicated some support for it, giving its supporters hope that they might be a majority willing to embrace it. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.

There are several different versions of the argument, some of which would merely limit the authority of state courts in certain circumstances and others that would go further in giving legislatures virtually unchecked authority.

A Supreme Court ruling that embraces the theory would affect not only redistricting disputes, but also other election-related rules about issues like mail-in voting and voter access to the polls that legislatures might seek to enact even when state courts have held that those rules violate state constitutions. The theory could also bring into question the power of governors to veto legislation.

Those backing the theory in briefs filed at the court include John Eastman, the lawyer involved in Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election who argued that then-Vice President Mike Pence could block the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory on Jan. 6, 2021.

Various conservative groups that push for greater restrictions on voting and claim that voter fraud is a major issue have also backed the theory at the court.

Democrats and voting rights activists have issued stark warnings about the potential impact of the case in light of the attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, although many high-profile GOP candidates who denied or questioned Biden’s victory lost in this year’s midterm elections.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-weighs-north-carolina-dispute-upend-election-law-rcna60315,2022-12-07T12:13:39.638000+00:00
264,Fauci criticizes 'extreme' ideological divide that has led to disproportionate Covid deaths,"Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top infectious disease expert and a chief proponent of Covid vaccines, sharply criticized the ""extreme"" ideological divide that he said has led to a disproportionate amount of coronavirus deaths among Republicans compared to Democrats.

In an interview with NBC News' Lester Holt scheduled to air Wednesday night, Fauci said he thought political viewpoints had a measurable effect on the number of people who could have been saved by the coronavirus vaccine.

""I mean, differences in ideology are healthy. It’s part of our democracy, part of what makes our country great. But when they get so extreme that it prevents you from doing something that’s life saving, that is really awful,"" he said.

Watch the full interview on “NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt” tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.

Several studies have found that Covid deaths are unevenly distributed among Republicans and Democrats. One study, published in September by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that so-called excess death rates, or deaths elevated beyond what is expected based on historical trends, were 76% higher in Florida and Ohio among Republicans than Democrats from March 2020 to December 2021.

“The degree of divisiveness in this country right now has really led to such a polarization that it has interfered with an adequate science-based public health response,” Fauci, who was a member of former President Donald Trump's Covid task force, told NBC News.

“I mean, it’s just extraordinary that you have under-vaccination in red states, and good levels of vaccination in blue states, which gets translated into a disproportionate amount of suffering and death among Republicans compared to Democrats,” he added. “That’s completely crazy.”

Fauci announced in August that, at the end of the year, he would leave his post at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which he has directed since 1984, and step down as President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fauci-criticizes-extreme-ideological-divide-led-disproportionate-covid-rcna60463,2022-12-07T12:00:33+00:00
265,Family of deceased Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick snubs GOP leaders,"The family of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died hours after defending the Capitol on Jan. 6, refused to shake hands with the two top Republican members of Congress at a Tuesday ceremony.

The Sicknick family members walked by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., during a ceremony on Tuesday recognizing hundreds of officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6.

McConnell had his hand outstretched, but Sicknick’s family ignored his gesture. They told NBC News after the event that passing on the opportunity to shake the GOP leaders’ hands was not a mistake.

“We got together and said we’re not going to shake their hands,” Gladys Sicknick, mother of the late officer, told NBC News.

She called out congressional Republicans who continue to support former President Trump, “go down to Mar-a-Lago and you know, kiss his ring or whatever the hell they do down there, you know.” She met with Republican lawmakers last year asking for them to vote in support of creating a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the Capitol attack. McConnell and McCarthy were opposed to the commission. The legislation passed the House, but it was blocked in the Senate due to a Republican opposition led by McConnell.

Ken Sicknick, brother of the late officer, told NBC News that their refusal to shake GOP leaders’ hands at the ceremony is “kind of self-explanatory.”

“They continue to perpetrate the big lie, or at least not denounce it, which is basically the same thing, and they refuse to condemn Donald Trump,” he said, referring to the former president’s false claims of widespread election fraud in the 2020 election.

Craig Sicknick, another brother of the late officer, also called McCarthy out for his initial condemnation of Trump after the Capitol attack, but ultimately remained a staunch supporter of the former president.

“I mean, they’re speaking here today in honor of the officers and what happened but at the same token out of the other side of their mouth, ... they’re doing a lot to support what caused the events of January 6, instead of denouncing them,” Craig Sicknick said.

Former Metropolitan Police Department Officer Mike Fanone, who suffered a heart attack and traumatic brain injury after being violently assaulted Jan. 6, said he was “surprised” McCarthy made an appearance at the ceremony.

“I was surprised, actually, that Kevin McCarthy showed up. I thought that he would be busy trying to figure out how he could suspend the Constitution on behalf of former President Trump,” Fanone said in an interview with CNN.

“That ceremony happened in spite of Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell, not because of them,"" he added. ""And so, the fact that they got to go there and speak words, I mean, they were meaningless.”

Fanone separately told NBC News that members of MPD heckled him inside the rotunda during the ceremony.

“I was heckled by members of my own department,” he said. “They called me a piece of s--- and mockingly called me a great f------ hero while clapping.”

Fanone, who was among four officers who testified Tuesday at the first hearing of the House select committee investigating Jan. 6, said that they told him he was a disgrace and didn’t belong at the ceremony. Fanone said the hecklers were from the Special Operations Division.

Sicknick was given the rare distinction of lying in honor in the building’s Rotunda. He was injured “while physically engaging with protesters” and returned to his division office, where he collapsed, Capitol Police said in a statement.

Washington’s chief medical examiner determined that Sicknick died of natural causes the day after the riot on Jan. 6 after he suffered two strokes.

Last September, Capitol rioter Julian Khater pleaded guilty to two counts of assaulting law enforcement officers in a virtual court appearance before U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan.

266,Rep. Ted Lieu reflects on becoming the highest-ranking Asian American ever in House Democratic leadership,"Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., who recently became the first Asian American to be elected vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, took a moment to reflect with NBC News on how he got there. Lieu, a Taiwanese immigrant, said much of his early years in the U.S were spent with his family at the flea market in Cleveland, selling gifts and fending off shoplifters to make ends meet.

“To go from that, to now being in House leadership in the Democratic caucus,” Lieu said, shows “the durability of the American dream.”

His arc is also somewhat of a metaphor for a larger phenomenon happening in the Asian American community. In the past few years this group has experienced a surge of political activity, influence and visibility — they are increasingly understood as a part of the American society, he said. And this evolution, Lieu noted, coincided with his own trajectory.

“It’s actually more of a recognition by my colleagues of the growing importance of the Asian American Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities,” he said.

In addition to the Asian American community’s growing political power, Lieu's rise is seen as attributable to the strength of coalitions, his active participation in the caucus and various experience he’s racked up along the way.

Lieu, who also won re-election of his seat earlier last month, will be succeeding fellow California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the new caucus chair, at the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3. Lieu defeated three other contenders: Reps. Joyce Beatty of Ohio, Debbie Dingell of Michigan, and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania in a vote among his colleagues in the House.

The congressman said he credits his election partly to an “understanding” from the caucus that having Asian American representation in leadership was a necessity, given the community’s burgeoning political power.

In two decades the Asian American electorate surged 139%, according to Pew Research. And during the midterms, the Asian American vote made up the margin of victory in a number of races including in Nevada, where Asian Americans make up 10% of the electorate and helped swing the 3rd Congressional District blue, and Georgia, where the racial group could tip the scale in a tight runoff Tuesday.

The congressman added that beyond Asian Americans, his win also showcases the power of a broad collective. In addition to the strong support from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Lieu said the endorsement from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, that included a speech from chair Rep. Raul Ruiz of California, was also an important aspect of the campaign.

“If you look at what the House Democratic Caucus did, it was, I feel, remarkable. Over 200 people in independent elections and races basically elected a leadership team that represents the beautiful diversity of America,” he said. “It shows that all our various groups and caucuses are working together to basically put people before politics and help American families.”

Madalene Mielke, president and CEO of Asian Pacific Institute for Congressional Studies, told NBC News that Lieu in Democratic leadership could have a significant impact on the Asian American community.

“This really does put sort of a pin in that Asian Americans now have someone in the room who can help to set legislative priorities and be able to really think about it from the lens of an Asian American,” Mielke said. “I think this is a part of the evolution of how the leadership in the Democratic caucus has really embraced the reflective diversity of its members.”

Of course, Mielke said, simply electing an Asian American doesn’t always translate to a representation of the community’s interests. Genuine inclusion involves a concerted effort to ensure that Asian Americans feel seen across all legislative priorities from health care to education, she said. And already, Lieu has been vocal about language access, an issue of critical importance to Asian Americans, who have a disproportionate number of people with limited English proficiency or whose English is a second language, Mielke said.

Lieu also reflected on paving the way for others.

“I remember growing up and when I found out that S.B. Wu was lieutenant governor of Delaware, I thought, ‘Huh, this Asian American is in a pretty high position in Delaware.’ And then I discovered later Gary Locke was governor of Washington state,” Lieu recalled. “It occurred to me that well, if they could do that, then anyone can be anything in America. And I think that’s true. Personally, when I see diverse representation it does give me hope.”

While Lieu’s win is meaningful and historic, it’s not necessarily surprising, Mielke said. She pointed out that Lieu previously served as vice chair of the Policy and Communications Committee and has made a name for himself as a vocal member of the caucus. Last year, Lieu co-sponsored the article of impeachment on Trump and was subsequently chosen by Speaker Nancy Pelosi as a manager in Trump's second impeachment trial. In June, Lieu went viral for reciting what “Jesus said about homosexuality,” before standing in silence on the House floor for 20 seconds.

Lieu has been well-positioned to ascend in leadership, she said.

“He has a pretty strategic plan when it comes to how he communicates messaging to people — to his constituents and to people across all communities,” Mielke said. “He has just shown that he’s a leader that happens to be Asian American.”

And while Asian Americans have long been stereotyped across industries as good workers rather than strong leaders, something that’s hindered the group in sectors from business to law, Mielke said Lieu has managed to buck the trope in the eyes of his colleagues.

“Congressman Lieu has always just been a very sort of forthright person. He’s just kind of no-nonsense. And I think his tweets really highlight who he is as an authentic individual,” Mielke said, referring to his sharp Twitter presence that has well over 1 million followers. “I think that’s a part of the narrative that people have about who he is and meeting the moment.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/rep-ted-lieu-reflects-becoming-highest-ranking-asian-american-ever-hou-rcna60179,2022-12-06T22:12:16.357000+00:00
267,Special counsel Jack Smith subpoenas local officials in Trump investigation,"Special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed local officials in key presidential swing states for any and all communications involving former President Donald Trump, his campaign and a series of aides and allies who assisted in his effort to overturn the 2020 election.

Subpoenas were issued to top elections officials in Wayne County, Michigan; Milwaukee and Dane counties, Wisconsin; Maricopa County, Arizona; and Allegheny County, Pa. Those counties are home to Detroit, Milwaukee, Madison, Phoenix and Pittsburgh.

The existence of the subpoenas was first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday.

The subpoena is an indication that Smith is probing into a scheme involving fake electors, a slate of individuals who signed documents purporting they were their states’ rightful electors and asserting Trump was the victor in their states even though Biden won.

A spokesperson for Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson confirmed that Smith’s office had sent a subpoena. A copy of the document, obtained by NBC News and issued Nov. 22, asked for any and all records of communications with or involving Trump, his campaign and a list of 19 aides and allies. The subpoena sought communications from June 1, 2020, to Jan. 20, 2021.

Those aides and allies included campaign attorneys and other lawyers who worked closely on Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, such as Justin Clark, Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Victoria Toensing, John Eastman, Cleta Mitchell and Jenna Ellis. Bill Stepien, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, was also on that list.

Bruce Marks, one of Trump's lawyers in the list, had not heard he was included until contacted by NBC News.

""It’s a gross overreach,"" Marks said. ""They are seeking clearly privileged communications between me and other attorneys who were involved with the Trump campaign.""

“There is speculation that the subpoena concerns the matters involving fake electors, as well as the January 6 insurrection,” Christenson said a statement Tuesday afternoon. “I am supportive of this investigation as it is important that the due process of law takes its course for the sake of our Nation and its democratic institutions.”

Scott McDonnell, the Dane County clerk, confirmed to NBC News that his county had received a virtually identical subpoena as Milwaukee. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson confirmed that Wayne County had also received a subpoena, though she had not personally been made aware of its contents as of Tuesday afternoon.

An Arizona elections official confirmed that Maricopa County had received such a subpoena this month with similar demands for those communications.

""Maricopa County has received a subpoena and will comply,"" Fields Moseley, a county spokesperson, said.

In Allegheny County, a spokesperson confirmed receipt of the subpoena and said they have ""nothing further to provide.""

A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment to NBC News.

Representatives of other large counties that Trump focused on in efforts to overturn the vote, including Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, and Fulton County, Georgia, said they had not received similar subpoenas or did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Smith was tapped last month by Attorney General Merrick Garland to oversee the Justice Department's investigation of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and the criminal probe of Trump's possible mishandling of classified documents. The subpoenas show Smith's probe touching on the run-up and immediate aftermath of the Capitol riot, seeking information related to Trump's pressure campaign.

Most of the individuals named in this new recent round of subpoenas were also named in at least some subpoenas involving the fake elector scheme in June, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. In some cases, the Justice Department seized cell phones of the individuals, including Nevada GOP Chair Michael McDonald, who previously confirmed as much to NBC News.

One of the names that appeared on the new subpoenas was James Troupis, a Wisconsin-based attorney who handled Trump's re-election efforts in the state, which centered on Dane and Milwaukee counties. In the final weeks of the 2022 campaign, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson hired Troupis, ostensibly to do possible recount work, even as questions persist about Johnson's conversations with Troupis on Jan. 6.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/special-counsel-jack-smith-subpoenas-local-officials-trump-investigati-rcna60363,2022-12-06T19:07:45.824000+00:00
268,Ethics panel directs Madison Cawthorn to donate $15K for improperly promoting Let's Go Brandon cryptocurrency,"The House Ethics Committee directed GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina to pay nearly $15,000 to a charity Tuesday after finding ""substantial evidence"" that he improperly promoted a cryptocurrency while in Congress.

The fine caps an investigation announced in May that looked into whether the scandal-plagued lawmaker touted a cryptocurrency known as a Let's Go Brandon coin in which he had a financial interest, and whether he engaged in “an improper relationship” with an aide on his congressional staff. The committee said in its 81-page report that it did not find evidence of improprieties between Cawthorn and the staffer.

However, the subcommittee that conducted the probe said Cawthorn violated rules against conflicts of interest surrounding the cryptocurrency and directed him to pay $14,237.49 to an appropriate charitable organization by Dec. 31.

It also found that Cawthorn, 27, failed to file timely reports to the House ""disclosing his transactions relating to the cryptocurrency."" And even though the panel determined that he did not knowingly fail to file the disclosures in a timely fashion, he was still required by law to pay $1,000 to the Treasury Department in late fees.

NBC News has reached out to Cawthorn's office for comment.

The House probe came after an April complaint filed with the Office of Congressional Ethics by the American Muckrakers PAC citing a Washington Examiner article that named “multiple watchdog groups” suggesting the first-term lawmaker may have violated insider trading laws in an alleged cryptocurrency scheme.

In its complaint, the PAC also accused Cawthorn of having a relationship with one of his aides.

The subcommittee which reviewed documents and interviewed Cawthorn and six other witnesses in connection with the allegations, said it did not find evidence that Cawthorn engaged in an improper relationship with a member of his staff ""and recommended no further action with respect to that allegation.""

Cawthorn, who was backed by former President Donald Trump in this year’s GOP primary, lost his renomination bid shortly after causing an uproar when he claimed on a podcast that aired in March that unnamed, older congressional colleagues were using drugs and that some of them had invited him to a “sexual get-together.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/madison-cawthorn-fined-improperly-promoting-cryptocurrency-rcna60424,2022-12-06T23:43:20.959000+00:00
269,"RNC chair defends mail-in voting, even as Trump trashes the practice","Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel unequivocally endorsed mail-in balloting Tuesday, distancing herself from former President Donald Trump on an issue that is fracturing the GOP in the wake of disappointing election results this fall.

“What we do need is our voters need to vote early,” McDaniel, a longtime Trump ally, said during a televised interview on Fox News. “I have said this over and over again. There were many in 2020 saying, ‘Don’t vote by mail, don’t vote early.’ And we have to stop that.”

McDaniel's comments came as part of an extended discussion on ballot harvesting — the third-party collection of completed absentee ballots. McDaniel said the RNC has ""perfected"" the practice in states where it's legal before making her broader point about taking advantage of early and mail-in voting.

""The discussion was about Democrats having a month to bank votes while Republicans expect to get it done in one day,"" RNC spokesperson Nathan Brand said in a statement to NBC News. ""We were not talking about the former president, who has encouraged his base to vote early and has himself voted by mail.""

But Trump, who already has launched a 2024 presidential campaign, also is the most prominent skeptic of voting by mail. He continues to raise false and unsubstantiated claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, in part through vote-by-mail programs in battleground states. As recently as last week on his Truth Social website, he wrote, in all capital letters for emphasis: “YOU CAN NEVER HAVE FAIR & FREE ELECTIONS WITH MAIL-IN BALLOTS — NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.”

McDaniel’s comments Tuesday came as voting was set to end in Georgia’s Senate runoff between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and GOP challenger Herschel Walker. Early voting there has shattered records, suggesting an edge for Warnock.

The GOP's early voting deficiencies have come under greater scrutiny after losses in 2020 and 2022. What many believed would be a Republican wave this fall ended with Democrats losing the House but maintaining control of the Senate, while holding onto -- or picking up -- governorships in key states.

""Let’s be clear the GOP did an exceptional job at targeting, pushing and winning vote by mail and early vote before Trump, without merit, cast all vote by mail as suspect and not reliable,"" Chris McNulty, a former RNC political director, tweeted Tuesday. ""If you’re looking for someone to blame … it’s Trump more than anyone.""

McDaniel is seeking a fourth term as RNC chair. She faces several possible opponents, including Rep. Lee Zeldin, who lost a surprisingly close race for governor in New York; MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a 2020 election conspiracy theorist with a right-wing following; and Harmeet Dhillon, an RNC member from California.

Trump, who handpicked McDaniel as RNC chair after the 2016 election, has not weighed in on the upcoming race. The RNC’s 168 members are expected to vote on the matter at their winter meeting next month.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/rnc-chair-defends-mail-voting-even-trump-trashes-rcna60405,2022-12-06T21:19:57.047000+00:00
270,McConnell and McCarthy got snubbed by Jan. 6 heroes. Good.,"There’s no doubt that our country is still incredibly divided after the deadly Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. But congressional Republicans and former President Donald Trump have made it difficult for our country to heal by continuing to fuel the “big lie” that led the rioters to storm the Capitol.

On Tuesday, the disdain for Republican leaders and their silence in condemning the violence was on full display at the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony. Recipients were the heroic law enforcement officers of the U.S. Capitol Police and the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department who protected the Capitol on Jan. 6.

It was a much-needed dramatic and unscripted moment during a ceremony that is usually anything but.

As some refused to shake hands with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, it was a much-needed dramatic and unscripted moment during a ceremony that is usually anything but. McConnell and McCarthy shouldn’t be allowed to just go on as if these moments are just business as usual. These leaders and any other elected official who has been either vocal about supporting the unfounded claims of a stolen election or stood in the way of holding those responsible accountable deserve to be snubbed.

Among those who refused to acknowledge McConnell and McCarthy was the family of fallen U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who suffered two strokes and died of natural causes the day after the attack.

After the ceremony, Sicknick’s mother told CNN that they had refused to shake McConnell and McCarthy’s hands because she views them as “two-faced” for claiming support for law enforcement yet at the same time singing Trump’s praises and “kissing his ring.”

And indeed, that’s what’s been happening. During the ceremony, McConnell touted the bravery of the officers who protected the Capitol on Jan. 6. “Because of your bravery and professionalism, Congress finished our job that very night,” he said. “Because you honored your oaths to support and defend the Constitution, we were able to honor ours. That is a reality that was made especially clear 23 months ago. But it is true every single day.” And McCarthy said, “Too many people take that for granted, but days like today force us to realize how much we owe the thin blue line.”

But it’s not hard to see how the sentiments are perceived as disingenuous when McCarthy has walked back his initial statements calling on Trump to take responsibility for what happened on Jan. 6 and has refused to cooperate with his colleagues on the House select committee investigating what happened that day. When he was asked by the committee in January to voluntarily provide information about his communication with the White House, he responded by describing the committee’s work as an “abuse of power that stains this institution today and will harm it going forward.”

Furthermore, in a quest to win the speakership, McCarthy has signaled that once the GOP takes control of the House next month, it will investigate the dealings of the Jan. 6 select committee investigating the attack. He and many of his GOP colleagues have made it abundantly clear that they believe the investigation was purely a political vehicle to attack Trump. Rather than recognize the bipartisan nature of the committee and the transparent work it has done to determine why and how our democracy came under attack, McCarthy and other House Republicans would rather play politics.

While McConnell has condemned Trump for his actions, he still didn’t lend his support to an investigation. Through a filibuster in May 2021, he blocked the creation of an independent commission to investigate the attack and made clear to his GOP Senate colleagues ahead of the vote that he did not support the commission.

Getting to the bottom of what happened on Jan. 6 and making sure everyone responsible is held accountable has fallen on the shoulders of House Democrats with the support and participation of just two Republicans, Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming — both of whom were censured by the RNC, will not be serving in the next Congress and have been outspoken critics of Trump.

Even deciding to recognize the brave officers who fought against the rioters became a divisive issue. Despite the extreme suffering faced by officers and their acts of heroism that day, there were 21 House Republicans who voted against awarding all the first responders with Congressional Gold Medals — Congress’ highest honor — during a June 2021 floor vote. The reason? Well, it included being opposed to calling the attack an “insurrection” and the Capitol a “temple.”

Many of the law enforcement officers who risked their lives to defend the Capitol and members of Congress who were inside were injured by the violent rioters, and the trauma even caused some officers to take their own lives in the days and weeks following the violent attack. The Congressional Gold Medal ceremony on Tuesday was a moment for these heroes to be recognized for their service and sacrifice, and it served as an important reminder that Republican leaders aren’t going to be able to boast that their party has a platform that supports law enforcement and the Constitution when their actions show the exact opposite.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/mcconnell-mccarthy-congressional-gold-medal-jan-6-officer-snub-rcna60396,2022-12-07T11:00:34+00:00
271,Supreme Court case on North Carolina gerrymandering threatens democracy,"On its face, Moore v. Harper, the case being considered by the Supreme Court on Wednesday, deals with whether the North Carolina Supreme Court acted within its rights last year. In 2021, the state's highest court overturned the congressional redistricting maps drawn by the GOP-controlled state Legislature for being gerrymandered along partisan lines.

The Independent State Legislature doctrine could open the door to giving state legislators the power to decide, for example, which presidential candidate will receive their state’s Electoral College votes.

But the reality is that the impact of the justices’ eventual ruling in this case could extend far beyond the state or the once-per-decade process of drawing congressional districts. That’s because the plaintiffs appealing the North Carolina court’s ruling are employing a fringe legal theory — the so-called Independent State Legislature doctrine, or ISL — that argues the U.S. Constitution grants unique power over federal elections to state legislatures.

In their opening brief to the Supreme Court, attorneys for the Republican state lawmakers invoked a sweeping interpretation of the Constitution’s Elections Clause, arguing that “the power to regulate federal elections lies with state legislatures exclusively.”

If taken to its radical extreme, this reading of the Constitution would give state lawmakers, not governors or state courts, authority over not only how the maps get drawn but also over all the rules about how federal elections are administered, how the votes get counted and even which candidate wins.

You heard that right: If endorsed by the Supreme Court, the Independent State Legislature doctrine could open the door to giving state legislators the power to decide, for example, which presidential candidate will receive their state’s Electoral College votes regardless of how the people actually voted. In practice, we could see a rogue legislature, displeased with their state’s election results, spur manufactured chaos and delays and invoke the ISL as justification for them to step in and unilaterally send its own slate of electors to participate in the Electoral College vote for president — with no clear path for the state’s governor or courts to check their actions.

Though the Elections Clause hasn’t been understood this way in the past, such a reinterpretation isn’t all that hypothetical. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump used ISL as the centerpiece of his efforts to convince Republican lawmakers in key states to overturn the will of their voters and declare him the winner, thereby handing him a second term.

It didn’t work then, but if ISL gets the stamp of approval from the Supreme Court’s current rightwing supermajority, it might work in 2024 if Trump or another antidemocracy candidate attempts to steal the election again. If so, the idea of American democracy as we’ve known it would be dramatically altered. Validating ISL would undermine our foundational system of checks and balances — usurping the role of state governors, courts and constitutions in the election process — and would hand over even greater power to extreme partisan legislators.

Those are the stakes in this case. No pressure.

Unfortunately, it’s highly likely that the court does go down this dark path. At least four justices have already signaled some level of openness to ISL — just one short of the majority, with Trump-appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett positioned to potentially serve as the swing vote.

The most important antidote, in that case, is electing as many pro-democracy lawmakers to state legislatures as possible — lawmakers who will uphold the voice of the voters and stand up against efforts to undermine elections in their states.

At The States Project, we’ve put our money where our mouth is. We invested nearly $60 million in state legislative efforts throughout the 2022 cycle to defend and build governing majorities in key state chambers that would be in a position to prevent the theft of the 2024 presidential election while promoting efforts that would safeguard democracy, protect individual rights and improve people’s lives. Given the imminent threat posed by a ruling on Moore v. Harper and the large number of Republicans serving in state legislatures who are election deniers, we prioritized electing Democratic majorities that could serve as a bulwark against future election subversion attempts in their states.

This historic investment in these chambers — larger than any other outside effort focused on state legislative races in a single cycle — paid off in spades. Backed by our investment, pro-democracy candidates made significant gains in key states, including in places where we spent heavily despite others doubting the victories we envisioned were possible.

We went all in on Michigan, helping to flip both chambers and creating the state’s first Democratic trifecta in nearly 40 years. We doubled-down in Pennsylvania, tuning out the naysayers and winning back the House from the right-wing majority for the first time in a decade.

And we refused to give up on Arizona, even when others called it a long shot — and now we expect that, when all the results are certified, Democrats will have held their ground in the state that has been called “‘Ground Zero’ of America’s democracy crisis.”

But while the importance of these wins cannot be overstated, they do not offer a permanent solution. There is always another election — a new opportunity for anti-democracy forces to again seize power. With the Supreme Court potentially lending their imprimatur to ISL this spring, each state legislative election could put the integrity of our democracy at risk.

For those of us who believe in democracy, that means only one thing: We cannot rest on our laurels. We must continue to treat state legislative campaigns like the crucial races they are and invest in them accordingly. Not just for one cycle, but every cycle.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/supreme-court-north-carolina-gerrymandering-case-threatens-democracy-rcna60410,2022-12-07T00:32:26.961000+00:00
272,Elon Musk's Twitter Files and Trump tweets complicate free speech,"Last week, Elon Musk promised the world that a treasure trove of internal Twitter documents showing how the social media company had suppressed reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop in 2020 would be released. These so-called Twitter Files were proof of “free speech suppression,” the billionaire claimed. The document dump, such as it was, turned out to yield little new information. But for supporters, the details are less important than the narrative: another battle in Musk’s grand war to protect and enable “free speech” — seemingly everywhere and anywhere.

It’s an attractive-sounding crusade, especially for those on the political right. But does free speech really need saving?

The essence of the First Amendment was born from the need to protect speech that we hate, not speech we love. The speech we love doesn’t need our protection; rather, it needs protection from people who may hate it and might therefore want to restrict or eliminate it from easy or any access. John Milton’s 1644 pamphlet “Areopagitica” highlighted this difficult goal lucidly, urging that the marketplace of ideas be kept open to everything, so that true ideas would not be kept from the public because they were mistakenly regarded as false.

Of course, Milton assumed that human beings are inherently rational, and able to discern truth from falsity. Thomas Jefferson, an early proponent of the First Amendment, did too. That assumption about human nature has always been risky. In the past few years, it has been put sorely to the test. And in the past few months, that turmoil has been brought to a boiling point by Musk and his own personal conception of free speech, embodied in his acquirement and administration of Twitter.

Before we get into that, we should be clear on exactly what the First Amendment does. It says Congress and the federal government — and by extension in the 14th Amendment, any state or local government — cannot abridge or limit speech or the press. Elon Musk, as far as I know, is not part of any government. He’s the owner and CEO of (several) private companies. That means he can pretty much do whatever he pleases with Twitter. He can make whatever rules he wants and break them when he feels like breaking them. This would be essentially true even if Twitter still were a publicly traded corporation. In that case, Musk could be held accountable by the stockholders. But as far as the First Amendment was concerned, he could still do whatever he wanted to — invite Ye back to Twitter, then ban him, and invite him back again.

On the other hand, free speech does not mean the total lack of limits. A criminal conspiracy organized online would be an appropriate and necessary target of government intervention and prosecution. Falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater (the famous example offered by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in the Supreme Court’s 1919 Schenck v. United States) is rightly prohibited as well. If we agree that endangering human lives is a worthy reason to limit a given communication, then spreading lies and conspiracy theories about something as deadly as Covid-19 surely deserves government prohibition, too.

Before Musk put in his bid to buy Twitter — which he later unsuccessfully attempted to rescind — he himself was the author of dangerous nonsense about the pandemic, promoting chloroquine as a possible remedy. Before Musk, Twitter wisely began labeling and then removing tweets that disseminated false information about the pandemic. For similar reasons — the endangering of human lives — Twitter before Musk correctly concluded that Donald Trump’s tweets had the potential to inspire violence after Jan. 6, 2021.

Since Musk took the reins of Twitter, proclaiming it a place where absolute free speech — or at least, almost absolute — would prevail, he has invited Trump back (Trump so far has declined the invitation) and decreed that Twitter would no longer enforce its banning and removal of Covid misinformation. As CEO, he has every right to do this. But it feels like Musk’s actions as head of Twitter are incorrectly being blended with his statements on free speech.

As someone who has been close to an absolutist regarding freedom of speech and press — that the government should keep its hands and rules off those and other media of communication — my calling for government intervention does not come easy. Just a few years ago, I said I disagreed with Karl Popper’s “paradox of tolerance” reasoning, which points out that a democratic government that is tolerant toward the publication of fascist ideas is laying the groundwork for its own destruction. I argued the very censorship of those fascist ideas is a big step toward fascism. But that was on Dec. 22, 2020, two weeks before the attack on the Capitol. As John Maynard Keynes is reputed to have said, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”

Fascism these days is no longer a hypothetical in an academic debate about freedom of the press.

So, yes, the facts have indeed changed here in the United States and around the world. Fascism these days is no longer a hypothetical in an academic debate about freedom of the press. It lives and destroys in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. It lives in the words of antisemites and white supremacists here in the United States. Is their hateful speech something that warrants protection by the First Amendment? Are their words examples of “awful but lawful” communication that we in our democracy must tolerate?

Musk’s self-proclaimed defenses of free speech sound good — most Americans remain, rightly, committed to this fundamental tenet of constitutional freedom. But such proclamations, as we saw with the ""Twitter Files"" debacle, can also be manipulative.

There’s a reason his actions are also giving many of us pause. Do we tolerate too much?

As Daniel Patrick Moynihan, James R. Schlesinger and many others have said, everyone is entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts. And this is especially true, I would add, when those twisted facts endanger our democracy and our lives.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/elon-musks-twitter-files-trump-tweets-complicate-free-speech-rcna60322,2022-12-06T18:43:00.269000+00:00
273,Deion Sanders is showing that upward mobility isn't just for white coaches,"After it was announced that football great Deion Sanders was leaving his coaching job at Jackson State University for an opportunity at the University of Colorado on Saturday, he faced criticism on social media. Many are upset that the Black former superstar is leaving a Historically Black University where his leadership could continue to provide a solid foundation for young Black athletes.

But this view is a bit shortsighted. Sanders should not be obligated to stay at an HBCU, and as Colorado's new head football coach, he has proven he’s true to his profession.

Upward mobility is not exclusive to white coaches.

That’s not only because of the success Sanders had in his three years coaching at Jackson State in Jackson, Mississippi, but also because his Colorado deal includes a reported base salary of $5 million a year. (He made $300,000 annually at Jackson State.) This means Sanders is looking out for himself, first and foremost.

And there’s nothing wrong with that. That’s what college football coaches do. They want the best contract they can get from a school where they believe they can win major championships. That’s why many a coach has changed jobs despite telling a new crop of fresh-faced recruits that he’s going to stay.

Sanders proved his ability in his first coaching job by making the Jackson State Tigers the best team among HBCUs. His 27-5 coaching record includes a 12-0 record this year and two consecutive Southwestern Athletic Conference titles.

In his final game at Jackson State, Sanders will lead the Tigers against North Carolina Central University in the Cricket Celebration Bowl on Dec. 17 in Atlanta. The Tigers will seek a victory in what has become known as “the Black national championship game.”

Some might say that Sanders, a Pro Football Hall of Famer and former Major League Baseball player who also excelled for years as a football commentator on network TV, should have been content to stay at Jackson State. Why not build the Tigers into a true dynasty while continuing to sing the praises of HBCUs?

But those critics should realize that Sanders has the same right as any other coach to pursue success at a higher level. That’s why he’s joining Colorado of the Pacific-12 Conference, one of college football’s Power Five conferences (along with the Big Ten, Southeastern Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference and Big 12).

Ambition is available to anyone willing to possess it. In that regard, Sanders is no different from, for example, Nick Saban, the legendary University of Alabama coach.

Those conferences have lucrative TV rights deals, such as the Big Ten’s seven-year, $7 billion contracts with NBC, Fox and CBS that begin in July 2023. And teams in these conferences compete in New Year’s Day bowl games and play for major championships on the biggest stages.

Sanders, having nicknamed himself “Coach Prime,” wants a piece of that action. His new goal is to lead the Colorado Buffaloes to a national championship. Not “the Black national championship.” The national championship.

Ambition is available to anyone willing to possess it. In that regard, Sanders is no different from, for example, Nick Saban, the legendary University of Alabama coach with whom Sanders appears in Aflac commercials.

At each previous stop in Saban’s head coaching journey (University of Toledo, Michigan State University, Louisiana State University and the NFL’s Miami Dolphins), he may well have disappointed some players who signed on hoping he would stay. But Saban asserted his right to accept new challenges, and with each success he has been rewarded handsomely. He’s won a record seven national championships (six at Alabama, one at Louisiana State), and he makes more than $11 million a year.

Upward mobility is not exclusive to white coaches. Sanders is showing the same ambition now that he had as a teenager in Fort Myers, Florida. Schools from coast to coast eagerly recruited the preternaturally gifted defensive back and kick returner. He could have gone to an HBCU such as Florida A&M University. The NFL still would have drafted him, as it did Jackson State’s Walter Payton, Mississippi Valley State University’s Jerry Rice and other legends who played at HBCUs.

It’s understandable for those who revere HBCUs to lament Sanders’ departure. He brought HBCUs the national attention they have long deserved.

Instead, Sanders chose Florida State University. One of the bigger schools. He wanted to match his skills against those who play at that level. He wants the same now as a coach.

As for those who wanted to play for Sanders at Jackson State, they can now consider Colorado. His son, Jackson State star quarterback Shedeur Sanders, is expected to do just that and follow his father. As can players beyond Jackson State. Winston Watkins Jr., a highly recruited wide receiver, says he’s going to Colorado after originally selecting Texas A&M. Asked why he made the change, Watkins told football website On3.com: “Deion Sanders. He is the GOAT [greatest of all time] and will always be. He’s an amazing coach and can develop me as a player and person.”

Jackson State, meanwhile, may be hard-pressed to find another coach as charismatic as Sanders. But it is possible for the Tigers to find a coach who can build on the foundation Sanders has laid. He’s hardly the only man who can inspire young Black men to succeed on the football field and in life.

It’s understandable for those who revere HBCUs to lament Sanders’ departure. He brought HBCUs the national attention they have long deserved. But he was never obligated to stay. He’s allowed to accept what he considers a better offer.

It’s better, then, to root for Sanders to succeed at Colorado so other Black people who aspire to coach will be more likely to get hired — at every level.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/deion-sanders-jackson-exit-to-colorado-black-coach-upward-mobility-rcna60223,2022-12-06T11:00:35+00:00
274,Supreme Court case on same-sex marriage could allow LGBTQ discrimination,"Does a website design company have a First Amendment right to discriminate against same-sex couples? That was essentially the question before the Supreme Court in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis on Monday. More specifically, the court considered two questions: Do businesses have the right to refuse certain services to same-sex couples, and do they have the right to post a statement on their websites explaining the religious justifications for doing so? The answer to both ought to be no. Unfortunately, the tenor of the oral argument suggests the answers may well be yes, opening the door to widespread discrimination against the LGBTQ community.

303 Creative LLC is a Colorado company that designs websites. Its owner Lorie Smith has her eye on expanding into the wedding market. However, she only wants to design wedding websites for straight couples, on the grounds that same-sex marriage conflicts with God’s will.

Unfortunately, little in Monday’s oral argument suggests that the Supreme Court will rule in Colorado’s favor.

Unfortunately for Smith, to refuse service to members of the public because they are gay is illegal: Colorado bans businesses, shops and other places of public accommodation from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. 303 Creative argues that its First Amendment rights trump Colorado’s antidiscrimination law.

If this case creates a feeling of déjà vu, that’s because the 2018 Masterpiece Cakeshop LTD v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission decision, concerning a bakery’s refusal to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, also raised free speech and religious liberty claims. But the Supreme Court reached no conclusion on the free speech claim and instead ruled in favor of the bakery on narrow religious grounds.

303 Creative v. Elenis, in contrast, is solely a free speech case. It argues that requiring it to design a wedding website for a same-sex couple forces it to endorse same-sex marriage in violation of the First Amendment’s free speech clause, which states that “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.”

Existing constitutional law requires at least two things to be true in order for 303 Creative to win: that providing website services to clients is speech that’s protected by the free speech clause, and that the government can’t articulate a reason that justifies possible infringement on the design company’s free speech rights. (No constitutional right is absolute, so even speech rights may have to yield to a compelling government interest.)

The first requirement may seem straightforward; after all, wedding websites for customers and 303 Creative’s proposed statement for the company’s own website both contain written words, and if written words are not speech, then what is? But this question is in fact complicated. Speech in the colloquial sense does not always match “speech” in the constitutional sense: Sometimes speech is not “speech” but conduct, and therefore not protected by the First Amendment, and sometimes conduct counts as protected “speech.”

For example, an American telling national security secrets to a foreign enemy is speech, but it would be treated as the conduct of treason — which is not protected by the free speech clause. A sign on a restaurant that says “We do not hire Black people” is words, but it would be treated as an act of discrimination that is not protected by the free speech clause, either.

For this reason, the proposed website statement, the second issue, might not be “speech” at all. It depends on the ruling on the first issue. If it turns out that 303 Creative does not have a free speech right to refuse service to same-sex couples, publishing a statement on its website that it will not provide wedding services to gay and lesbian couples could be characterized as discriminatory conduct that triggers no free speech review.

At the same time, conduct may express a message and therefore count as constitutionally protected “speech.” The classic example is burning a draft card. Even though a law that forbids starting fires in public outlaws conduct, because burning a draft card is intended to and understood to express a message — namely opposition to the draft — using the law to prosecute someone who burns a draft card may trigger free speech scrutiny. A law that targets conduct (burning) but also incidentally bans expressive conduct (burning a draft card to protest a war) is much less likely to be unconstitutional than a law that purposely bans speech.

The challenge here is how to classify 303 Creative’s making or refusing to make a website for same-sex couples. Is that pure speech? If so, Colorado’s public accommodations law is unconstitutional unless the government can show that the law is necessary to accomplish a government goal of the utmost importance. Is it pure conduct? If so, it does not trigger, never mind violate, the free speech clause. Or is it akin to expressive conduct, which is afforded some free speech protection but not at the same level as pure speech?

Not surprisingly, 303 Creative argues that the challenged law regulates pure speech. After all, the anti-discrimination law requires that it create a website of words and images. But that’s not a fair characterization of the law.

Colorado’s law actually bars companies that open their doors to the public from refusing to serve people based on certain characteristics like sexual orientation. That’s a regulation of conduct. If the place of public accommodation is a website designer, it might incidentally affect speech, but the law itself is not targeting speech. Consequently, its odds of being constitutional are much higher than if it were pure speech.

But because no constitutional right is absolute, even a pure free speech claim requires that the government cannot justify the challenged law by pointing to a really compelling need for it. In this case, the compelling need is obvious: to end discrimination against gay and lesbian couples in public spaces. This is how the government ensures not only equal access to goods and services but also equal citizenship and equal dignity.

Unfortunately, little in Monday’s oral argument suggests that the Supreme Court will rule in Colorado’s favor. The majority of justices seemed disinclined to see this law as one aimed at conduct. And continuing a trend established by previous cases that allowed Christian store owners and Christian organizations to discriminate against same-sex couples, the conservative justices mostly ignored the state’s interest in making sure its LGBTQ citizens are not treated as second-class citizens. Instead, various justices on the right emphasized Monday how decent people with honorable religious beliefs might oppose same-sex marriage.

The conservative justices mostly ignored the state’s interest in making sure its LGBTQ citizens are not treated as second-class citizens.

This could have sweeping implications that go well beyond wedding websites. If the court finds for 303 Creative, this right to discriminate against gay and lesbian people won’t be limited to those whose religion condemns same-sex marriage. It would extend to companies that oppose it for nonreligious reasons but can argue that providing their speech-based services to same-sex couples compelled them to express a message of support for that marriage. Potentially, any such company hostile to gays or lesbians could argue that taking their picture or printing an invitation or acting as their lawyer or agent or counselor would express approval of homosexuality.

Nor will this right to discriminate necessarily be limited to the LGBTQ community. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson suggested at the oral arguments, the argument is little different from the owners of malls claiming a free speech right to limit its Santa photos to white children if multiracial photos clash with their convictions.

If so, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor highlighted, it would be the first time the Supreme Court concluded that a commercial business open to the public could refuse service to someone based on their race, sex, religion or, as here, sexual orientation.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/supreme-court-case-same-sex-marriage-allow-lgbtq-discrimination-rcna60113,2022-12-05T23:31:21.640000+00:00
275,Trump's legal team should have known better than to ask for a special master,"To the untrained and the unwary, defending a person accused of a criminal offense may mean deploying a “win at all costs” strategy. But when Donald Trump’s defense team requested a special master to review records that were lawfully seized from Mar-a-Lago under a search warrant, we saw the startling hubris of defense attorneys who seemed to have closed their eyes to the law when it did not suit their goals.

Wanting a special master was right out of Trump’s stalling, obstructing and using the time to play the victim circus act. The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruling Thursday that a district judge was wrong to appoint such a review of the documents and stop the Justice Department from using them in its criminal investigation of Trump was the right move.

We saw the startling hubris of defense attorneys who seemed to have closed their eyes to the law when it did not suit their goals

Trump’s defense team had to know its request was meritless based on the separation of powers. In fact, a grade school social studies class (I’m surely dating myself now) may have known it. That’s where many first learn that the legislative branch makes the law, the executive branch enforces the law, and the judicial branch interprets the law.

Every defense attorney with a pulse knows, or should know, that the judicial branch, in just about every instance, has no right or authority to butt into a criminal investigation conducted by the executive branch (here, the Justice Department).

And if a defendant believes that it has the proverbial golden ticket (a nod to Willy Wonka) to get the judicial branch to stick a broomstick into the spokes of a Justice Department investigation where let’s say, the department has gotten and executed a search warrant, then the law is as clear as the right eyeglass prescription. The aggrieved party (here, Trump) must show proof of the following four: (1) the government’s callous disregard for his constitutional rights; (2) his interest in or need for the things seized; (3) he will be irreparably harmed if the stuff is not returned; and (4) he doesn’t have an adequate remedy at law.

Team Trump could not muster the strength to jump over the first hurdle. Not only was the government not callous when it came to Trump’s constitutional rights, but the government was also deferential and almost subservient to him. How many times was the former president politely asked to simply deliver the documents?

Now that we know that Trump’s defense had no ground to stand on the first standard of proof, what about the other three? Well, the Trump Team could fare no better with the second or third one. It comes down to one simple fact: These documents are not Trump’s. They belong to the government. The only harm Trump suffers if these documents are in the hands of the Justice Department is the ease with which he can be prosecuted — it is really over at the question of whether he possessed them.

In reality, the only one who suffers harm in the context of these documents is the public, and those who protect us in an undercover capacity because among the documents were highly classified information.

That brings us to No. 4. And the former president doesn’t have a case there either because he does have an adequate remedy at law, although it is one his defense team should hope it never has to use. The bad news is Trump would have to be indicted; the good news is Trump could then exercise his right to challenge (controvert) the search warrant and make a motion to suppress the fruits of the search. In other words, Trump could move to keep the seized documents out of prosecution by trying to argue that they were obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure.

A criminal defense attorney’s job is to get the client the best possible result. Defense counsel looks at the facts of a case and the applicable law in the hope that one of them favors the client. A seasoned defense attorney will look at the intersection of a case and determine that “if the facts take me down that road, I’ll go down that road” or “if the law takes me down that road, I’ll go down that road.”

When the district judge was considering whether to grant Trump a special master, she should have seen clearly that Team Trump was seeking to delay the proceedings.

But what happens if the defense attorney has neither? Then, it may be that the strategy is to simply slow down what may be inevitable. And that is where the district judge must step in to stop frivolous delay. The district judge is charged with a dual responsibility. One is to ensure that the delay is not the product of arguments by the defense that cannot be supported by existing law. The other is to decide whether the defense has presented a good faith argument that the law is wrong and should be changed, if not overturned.

When the district judge was considering whether to grant Trump a special master, she should have seen clearly that Team Trump was seeking to delay the proceedings by simply choosing to ignore fundamental concepts of separation of powers and the law.

A fifth grader knows that the judicial branch can’t make law. A 3L — or third-year — law student who’s taken criminal procedure knows that a search warrant is issued by a judge after the government provides proof that it is more likely than not that evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. A third-year associate in a law firm knows the difference between a court of law (where an aggrieved party wins money damages, for example) and a court of equity (where the court tries to be fair by issuing, for example, an injunction to maintain the status quo until the case is over). And I knew pretty early on in my criminal law career that it is rare that a criminal court can or will exercise equitable powers in a criminal case. In Trump’s case, the district court decided to sit as a court of equity. That was wholly improper.

Thankfully the appeals court got it right. Team Trump’s arguments were a sideshow. They were a not-so-thinly veiled effort to delay the Justice Department from sitting down with the documents seized under a court-blessed search warrant and determining whether it is time for Trump to account for his conduct. The former president cannot keep those entrusted with enforcing our laws on a wild goose chase forever. The 11th Circuit was correct in telling the Trump circus to pull up its Big Tent.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trumps-legal-team-special-master-request-ignored-the-law-rcna60073,2022-12-05T16:26:08.517000+00:00
276,China eases Covid restrictions in major shift after protests,"Officials have defended the policy as necessary to save lives in a country where the fragile health care system could be overwhelmed by uncontrolled outbreaks, touting China’s low death toll as evidence of the superiority of Communist Party rule.

But they had already begun easing restrictions before the protests began late last month, announcing 20 “optimized” measures on Nov. 11 that aimed to minimize the impact on the economy and society.

The protests were the biggest show of public unrest China had seen in decades, and were quickly put down by security forces. But local officials have since further eased lockdowns and testing requirements in an effort to address frustration with the restrictions, which have created an atmosphere of anxiety and undermined the world’s second-largest economy.

Social media users expressed relief but also ambivalence at Wednesday's announcement.

“To be honest, I don’t think there is anything to be happy about. I don’t feel anything. It’s mixed,” one person commented on Weibo, a popular social media platform similar to Twitter. “This virus is hard to prevent, and I have to fend for myself from now on.”

The National Health Commission said early Wednesday that those isolating at home would be subject to health monitoring and would be released after testing negative on the sixth and seventh days. Anyone whose condition worsens “will be transferred to a designated hospital for treatment in time,” it said in a statement listing 10 new measures.

Previously, people who tested positive for the virus were sent to centralized quarantine facilities regardless of the severity of their symptoms. Those facilities will still be available to people who do not wish to isolate at home.

The commission also said that proof of a negative PCR test and a green “health code” displayed on a smartphone app would no longer be required to travel between provinces or enter most public venues, aside from places like nursing homes, medical facilities, child care institutions and schools. Until now, many cities had required negative test results as often as daily in order to enter shopping malls or take public transportation.

The National Health Commission’s statement did not mention the protests or any official end to the “zero-Covid” policy. But it did prohibit the blocking of fire exits during lockdowns, which protesters had suggested contributed to the death toll in an apartment fire in the western city of Urumqi on Nov. 24. (Officials denied the allegation.)

Other measures announced on Wednesday included the lifting of restrictions on the sale of cold medications, which had previously required name registration in order to root out potential infections. Lockdowns will be limited to five consecutive days if no new infections are discovered, and must be highly targeted.

Echoing earlier remarks by top officials, the National Health Commission noted that the new omicron variant was weaker but more transmissible than previous variants of the virus. It also stressed the importance of inoculating China’s older population, whose relative undervaccination is one of the country’s biggest obstacles in transitioning to “living with the virus.”

Though still small by global standards, China has been reporting rising case numbers amid outbreaks driven by omicron. The National Health Commission said Wednesday there were 25,115 new infections nationwide, more than 80 percent of them asymptomatic.

The challenge for Chinese officials now is to prepare the public for potential infection with the virus after years of emphasizing its lethality. The hashtag “Pharmacists explain in detail how to treat omicron’s mild symptoms” has been trending this week on Weibo, which is tightly controlled by online censors.

Despite the eased restrictions, the likely explosion in cases means the pandemic will continue to loom large in the country where the virus was first detected in late 2019.

“Free?” one Weibo user said Wednesday. “In the past three years, from the age of 20 to 23, what I lost, only I know.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-eases-restrictions-zero-covid-protests-rcna60479,2022-12-07T13:06:33.435000+00:00
277,Dig at U.K. housing site yields major 7th century treasures,"A 1,300-year-old gold and gemstone necklace found on the site of a new housing development marks the grave of a powerful woman who may have been an early Christian religious leader in Britain, archaeologists said Tuesday.

Experts say the necklace, uncovered with other items near Northampton in central England, is part of the most significant early medieval burial of a woman ever found in the U.K.

The woman is long gone — some tooth enamel is all that remains. But scientists say her long-buried trove will shed new light on life in 7th century England, a time when Christianity was battling with paganism for people’s allegiance.

The items are “a definite statement of wealth as well as Christian faith,” said Lyn Blackmore, a senior finds specialist at Museum of London Archaeology, which made the discovery.

“She was extremely devout, but was she a princess? Was she a nun? Was she more than a nun — an abbess? … We don’t know,” Blackmore said.

The Harpole Treasure — named for the village where it was found, about 60 miles northwest of London — was unearthed in April by archaeologists working with property developer Vistry Group on a neighborhood of new houses.

On one of the last days of the 10-week dig, site supervisor Levente-Bence Balázs noticed something glinting in the dirt. It turned out to be a rectangular gold pendant with a cross motif, inlaid with garnets — the centerpiece of a necklace that also contained pendants fashioned from gold Roman coins and ovals of semiprecious stones.

“These artifacts haven’t seen daylight in more than 1,300 years,” Balázs said. “To be the first person to actually see it — it’s just indescribable.”

Researchers say the burial took place between 630 and 670 A.D., the same period as several other graves of high-ranking women that have been found around Britain. Earlier high-status burials were mostly men, and experts say the change could reflect women gaining power and status in England’s new Christian faith.

The Kingdom of Mercia, where the Harpole Treasure was found, converted to Christianity in the 7th century, and the woman buried there was a believer, maybe a faith leader. A large and ornate silver cross was placed on her body in the grave. It is adorned with tiny, astonishingly well-preserved likenesses of human heads with blue glass eyes, who may represent Christ’s apostles. Clay pots from France or Belgium, containing residue of an unknown liquid, were also found.

Within a few decades, as Christianity took hold more widely in England, the practice of burying people with their luxury goods died out.

“Burying people with lots and lots of bling is a pagan notion, but this is obviously heavily vested in Christian iconography, so it’s that period of quite rapid change,” said Simon Mortimer of archaeological consultants RPS, who worked on the project.

The Harpole discoveries will help fill in gaps in knowledge about the era between the departure of Britain’s Roman occupiers in the 5th century and the arrival of Viking raiders almost 400 years later. Experts say it’s one of the most significant Saxon finds since the 7th-century ship burial found in the 1930s at Sutton Hoo, about 100 miles to the east.

Once archaeologists have finished their work, the plan is for the items to be displayed in a local museum.

Property developers in Britain routinely have to consult archaeologists as part of their planning process, and Mortimer said the practice has yielded some important finds.

“We are now looking at places we would never typically have looked at,” he said, and as a result “we are finding genuinely unexpected things.”

“The scale of the wealth is going to change our view of the early medieval period in that area,” he added. “The course of history has been nudged, ever so slightly, by this find.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/dig-uk-housing-site-yields-major-7th-century-treasures-rcna60496,2022-12-07T13:52:02.396000+00:00
278,New Zealand court rules against anti-vax parents of ill baby,"A New Zealand court temporarily took away medical custody of a baby from his parents on Wednesday after they refused blood transfusions for him unless the blood came from donors who were unvaccinated against Covid-19.

The court’s ruling in favor of health authorities places the 4-month-old boy into the guardianship of authorities until after he undergoes an urgently needed heart operation and recovers. The parents remain in charge of decisions about their boy that don’t relate to the operation.

The parents’ legal battle has been embraced by anti-vaccine groups, who gathered outside the courtroom this week as evidence was presented.

High Court Judge Ian Gault said he accepted the affidavits of health experts who said there have been millions of blood transfusions performed around the world since coronavirus vaccines were introduced, and the vaccines hadn’t caused any known harmful effects.

The ruling will likely set a precedent and come as a relief to healthcare groups that collect and use donated blood.

The parents had said they had unvaccinated donors willing to give blood for their son’s operation, but health authorities argued that such directed donations should only occur in exceptional circumstances, such as for recipients with very rare blood types.

Health authorities also said the unvaccinated donors wouldn’t necessarily give them access to all the blood products they might need during the boy’s surgery.

The parents used discredited arguments and fringe theories to try to show that mRNA vaccines were unsafe.

The judge said the baby’s parents were loving and wanted the best for their son and accepted that he needed the surgery. The judge said the relationship between the parents and clinicians had suffered and that they should try to improve it before and after the surgery and be respectful of each other.

279,Moroccans celebrate historic World Cup win against Spain,"Morocco is the only Arab — and African — nation left in the tournament, the first World Cup held in the Middle East. Its World Cup success has reverberated across the Arab world and among Moroccan and some other immigrant communities in Europe.

In Barcelona, Spain’s second largest city, a crowd of youths waving Moroccan, Egyptian, Algerian and Palestinian flags gathered in the center, where fans of FC Barcelona traditionally celebrate big victories. People cheered to the sound of drums. Some were lighting flares.

In a Barcelona restaurant where viewers had congregated, people jumped on tables and lifted chairs in the air. Outside, cars honked horns and people lit firecrackers and red and green smoke bombs.

Youssef Lotfi, a 39-year-old construction worker who was born in Casablanca but moved to Spain as a child and said he feels love for both countries, was brimming with pride.

“Today is a day of joy for Moroccans and all the Arab world,” Lotfi said. “It was a heart-attack finish that could have gone either way.”

He called the victory “once in a lifetime” experience. “Morocco is representing all the Arab world, all the African continent, that is beyond description, it is the most glorious part,” he said.

In Ceuta, a Spanish exclave which borders with Morocco on the north African coast, the win was also celebrated with cars honking horns. Ceuta’s population is a mix of Spaniards and Moroccan residents and workers.

“What pride! What happiness! Now to celebrate with friends. I have lost my voice!” said 20-year-old Ismael Mustafa. “We were able to pull it off. For Spain? You will win next time, so no worries.”

Celebrations across Spain, which has some 800,000 Moroccan residents, were mostly peaceful, though Spanish media reported a brief scuffle between Morocco and Spain fans in a bar in the southern city of Huelva. No injuries or arrests were reported.

In Qatar, Moroccan fans clashed briefly with police outside the stadium before the game started.

Ten days ago riots broke out in Belgium and the Netherlands as Morocco fans celebrated beating Belgium in the group stage in Qatar.

In central Paris, cars started honking almost immediately after Morocco’s surprise win Tuesday, and crowds of people streamed toward the Champs-Elysees to celebrate. Men and women, in business suits or track suits, from teenage to middle-aged, cheered or raised their hands in victory. Cries of “Allez, allez!” in French rang out, and one woman asked strangers “Who has a Moroccan flag I can borrow?”

Spain fans were crushed by the loss.

“They have been very unlucky in the penalties, but it seems to me that they have also made a mistake in the players who take the penalties,” said 64-year-old Dionisio Sánchez, who was among a group of fans who trickled out of bar in Madrid.

“They shot with very little enthusiasm ... little desire to score, but the penalties, it’s luck, it’s a lottery,” he said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/moroccans-celebrate-world-cup-win-spain-rcna60493,2022-12-07T12:36:05.613000+00:00
280,Ukrainian drone attacks hit airbases in Russia. Here's what it means.,"A blast hit an airbase inside Russia on Tuesday, the latest in a series of apparent Ukrainian drone attacks that showcase an ability to strike at the heart of Russian territory and suggest a new boldness in Kyiv's fight against Moscow's war.

An airfield at Kursk in southwest Russia, near the Ukrainian border, was ablaze on Tuesday morning, with regional governor Roman Starovoit saying the incident was the result of a drone attack.

Photos and video verified by NBC News showed a large fire at the airfield caused by a suspected damaged oil tanker, with smoke trailing miles across the sky.

Similar explosions were seen on Monday at the Engels air base outside the city of Saratov and at Ryazan, just 125 miles southwest of Moscow and hundreds of miles away from the Ukrainian border.

The Engels base houses Russia's strategic bombing fleet of tu-160 and tu-95 planes, which have been used on long-range bombing missions to Ukraine and can be adapted to carry nuclear weapons.

Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility, but officials have jokingly suggested its military may be behind the incidents. Russia’s defense ministry blamed Kyiv’s forces for the two blasts Monday, in which it said three “maintenance personnel” died and two planes were damaged.

Analysts were cautious about the military impact of the apparent attacks on strategic sites far from the front lines, but said they had further undermined Russian confidence in the country's air defenses while providing a timely morale boost for Ukrainian civilians preparing for a long winter under bombardment.

“The signaling is important for the Ukrainians: They need to know that they are hitting back, given the amount of pain and devastation and general discomfort that’s being meted out in Ukraine,"" Matthew Ford, an associate professor at the Swedish Defense University in Stockholm, told NBC News.

""It’s important from a morale point of view that some Russian strategic resources are being targeted.""

Russia has the firepower to carry on bombing Ukraine, he added. ""It might be a pain, but they can relocate aircraft and infrastructure, they can put up more security around air bases.""

The attacks were inflicted, the Kremlin said, by ""Soviet-made UAV,"" or unmanned aerial vehicles. This suggests Ukraine is not using the billions of dollars' worth of lethal aid it has received from the United States and other Western allies in attacks on Russian soil, which Washington has feared could trigger an escalation.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukrainian-drone-attacks-russia-airbases-kursk-putin-war-what-it-means-rcna60276,2022-12-06T15:20:07.762000+00:00
281,Kirstie Alley died of colon cancer. These are the disease's early signs.,"Following the news that actor Kirstie Alley died of colon cancer at age 71, several doctors and cancer specialists urged people to get the recommended screenings for the disease.

Alley's manager confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday that the actor died of colon cancer. Alley’s family said in a statement on Monday night that the cancer had only recently been discovered.

""She was surrounded by her closest family and fought with great strength, leaving us with a certainty of her never-ending joy of living and whatever adventures lie ahead,"" the statement said.

Colorectal cancer is the fourth-most common form of cancer in the U.S. and the second-most deadly behind lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute estimates that around 151,000 cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed this year.

Colon cancer can be difficult to diagnose, however, since symptoms can resemble those of other conditions like hemorrhoids or irritable bowel syndrome.

""Unfortunately, colon cancer doesn't have a lot of symptoms until it's advanced, which is why screening is so important,"" said Dr. Paula Denoya, director of the Colorectal Surgery Residency Program at Stony Brook Medicine.

The pandemic also most likely delayed detection of some new cases, according to Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor in the department of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

""Patients have not had access to routine colonoscopy readily during Covid. As a result, cancers that would have been caught at an earlier stage are now presenting with more advanced and later stage,"" he said.

Nearly 90% of colorectal cancer patients are age 50 or older, so doctors recommend that everyone over 45 get a colonoscopy every 10 years.

But diagnoses in younger adults have been rising: New cases of colorectal cancer went up more than 2% each year among people under 50 from 2012 to 2016, according to the American Cancer Society.

""There’s an expectation there will be 15% of colorectal cancers in people under 50 not too long from now,"" said Dr. Joel Levine, co-director of the Colon Cancer Prevention Program at UConn Health.

Overall, the rate of new colorectal cancer cases in the U.S. has declined, from around 67 per 100,000 people in 1985 to around 34 in 2019, according to the National Cancer Institute.

Early signs of the disease can include rectal bleeding or changes in bowel movements such as constipation or diarrhea. Patients with more advanced illness may also experience abdominal pain, fatigue, anemia, weight loss or decreased appetite.

But Levine said people should get colonoscopies even when they feel healthy.

""One of the reasons I’m so fussy about not waiting for symptoms is because it leads to, 'Well, I feel alright, everything’s OK.' And by the time you have a symptom, the horse is a little bit out of the barn,"" he said.

Colonoscopies allow doctors to examine the colon and remove precancerous growths, which can prevent cancer from forming. However, the procedure requires sedation or anesthesia and can cost thousands of dollars without insurance.

""Patients have barriers to getting colonoscopies, whether it be insurance, whether it be time off work, they don’t want to do it or they have medical problems that make it higher risk,"" Denoya said.

As an alternative for patients facing these issues, doctors sometimes suggest a stool test. There are various types: One, called Cologuard, can detect changes in a person’s DNA and should be done every three years. Denoya said that test is good at finding cancer but less effective at flagging precancerous growths.

A second type of stool test, called the FIT, looks for hidden traces of blood that may signal the presence of cancer. Denoya said that test should be performed annually. If either test returns abnormal results, doctors will still recommend a colonoscopy.

Beyond age, other risk factors for colon cancer include obesity and lifestyle factors like smoking or drinking.

More than half of colorectal cancer diagnoses in the U.S. are attributable to behavioral patterns, including physical inactivity, diets high in red or processed meat, and a low intake of fruits, vegetables and fiber.

A family history of colon cancer can also raise one's risk.

""If somebody has a parent or sibling that had colon cancer, then that person would start screening 10 years younger than [when] their family member had it,"" Denoya said.

Patients diagnosed early have a high survival rate.

""If the patient is diagnosed with a stage one or localized cancer, where it's just in the colon and hasn't moved elsewhere in the body, it's about 90% curative just with surgery,"" Denoya said.

More advanced cases may require chemotherapy or radiation. People whose tumors have spread to nearby lymph nodes or areas around the colon have a 72% survival rate after five years. The rate drops to 14% for patients whose cancer has spread to other organs or more distant lymph nodes.",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kirstie-alley-colon-cancer-signs-symptoms-disease-rcna60310,2022-12-06T22:39:33.570000+00:00
282,"Five women file lawsuit against Bill Cosby, accusing him of sexual assault","Five women, including two actors who appeared on “The Cosby Show,” filed a lawsuit in New York on Monday, accusing disgraced comedy legend Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting them.

The plaintiffs named the actor, Kaufman Astoria Studios Inc., The Carsey-Werner Company and NBCUniversal Media as defendants in the 34-page lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.

""The Cosby Show,"" which ran from 1984 to 1992 on NBC, was filmed at studios now controlled by Kaufman Astoria and produced by Carsey-Werner, according to the civil action.

All the defendants are ""culpable and liable because they knew and/or should have known that Bill Cosby was sexually abusing, assaulting, and/or battering women, including on their premises, but did nothing to stop it,"" according to the complaint.

NBC News does not typically identify victims of sexual assault, but the five women in this civil action all named themselves in the complaint.

Actor Lili Bernard, who appeared in a ""Cosby"" episode, said the defendant arranged for her transportation out of New York when he allegedly drugged and raped her — in New Jersey in August 1990 and then months later in Nevada.

Eden Tirl, who was offered a small role on ""Cosby"" despite having no acting experience, accused Cosby and producers of pressuring her numerous times to have lunch with him in his private dressing room in 1989. When she relented, Cosby allegedly ""touched her breasts and without her consent forcibly pressed his penis into"" her back, according to the suit.

Aspiring actor Jewel Gittens said that in “or around the late 1980s,” Cosby invited her to his home in Manhattan where she was given what she says was a tainted glass of wine. She says she felt sluggish as Cosby allegedly sexually assaulted her with his finger and ""ejaculated from the sexual encounter.""

Aspiring model Jennifer Thompson said she was 18 in the late 1980s when Cosby allegedly grabbed her ""hand and forcefully placed it on his penis"" and made the victim ""masturbate him without her consent"" at the actor's Manhattan home, according to the lawsuit.

Cindra Ladd, a ""platonic"" friend of Cosby's said the actor drugged her in ""approximately 1969"" and allegedly raped her while she was passed out.

The lawsuit did not name a dollar figure sought by the plaintiffs.

Cosby's spokesman Andrew Wyatt called the civil action ""frivolous"" and accused plaintiffs of seeking a payout.

""We believe that the courts as well as the court of public opinion will follow the rules of law and relieve Mr. Cosby of these alleged accusations,"" Wyatt said in a statement.

""Mr. Cosby continues to vehemently deny all allegations waged against him and looks forward to defending himself in court.""

A spokeswoman for defendant NBC Universal Media LLC, the parent company of NBC News, declined comment.

Reps for the other two defendants could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.

Cosby was released from a Pennsylvania prison on June 30 last year after the state's high court overturned his conviction on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault in 2018.

The state Supreme Court ruled that Cosby's rights against self-incrimination were violated when a prosecutor declined to press a case against the actor in 2014, allowing ""America's Dad"" to speak freely in a civil lawsuit.

But a second prosecutor in the same jurisdiction later used the lawsuit testimony in a criminal trial, and that testimony was key in his conviction for drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004.

283,Who made Google’s top trending searches of 2022?,"Actor Johnny Depp topped Google’s list of trending people in 2022.

The company released Wednesday its “2022 Year in Search — Themes and Insights” report, with data that it says reflects the year’s trending topics, meaning the searches that received a significant increase in traffic over a sustained period of time this year compared to last year.

Depp won his defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard in June. Heard was the third top trending person on Google Search this year.

The Depp-Heard trial also took a prominent spot in users’ search history this year. Depp sued Heard for defamation in 2019 after she described herself as a “public figure representing domestic abuse” in a 2018 op-ed in The Washington Post. The trial began in April.

A jury found that Heard defamed Depp and awarded him $15 million in damages. Heard was also awarded $2 million in compensatory damages for her $100 million countersuit against Depp. The verdict in the trial was the ninth top trending news topic.

Google's 2022 list also showed there was high interest in the Oscars moment when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock after the comedian joked about the actor’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. The incident landed at No. 8 on the top trending “news” category.

Smith and Rock were second and seventh on the top trending “people” category. Jada Pinkett Smith was also featured in the trending “actors” category.

U.S. users also expressed interest in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, specifically looking for ways to help people in Ukraine. Three of the top trending “How to help” searches included “How to help Ukraine?” “How to help Ukrainian refugees?” and “How to help Ukraine army?”

Ukraine was also the sixth on the general “searches” category and third on the top trending “news” category.

Many were also curious about niche internet trends this year. According to Google, ""more than ever before,"" the world searched for ""goblin mode"" (which Oxford Dictionaries named Monday as its word of the year). People also wondered ""what is web3,"" which is short for Web 3.0. CNBC described it as a ""hypothetical, future version of the net based on blockchain technology.""

Andrew Tate, the self-described “success coach” who has been criticized online for what many see as misogynistic advice, topped Google’s 2022 category for trending “who is …” questions.

Google Trend data showed that interest in Tate grew in May and spiked in August, around the time he was banned from Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube for violating each platform’s community guidelines. He was also the eighth top trending person on Google.

One of the internet's biggest 2022 debates — ""are there more doors or wheels in the world"" — ranked as the top trending or searched worldwide. A New Zealand rugby league manager first posed the divisive question in March, asking people on Twitter: ""Do you think there are more doors or wheels in the world?"" His tweet went viral, and the debate bubbled over to TikTok, where people used #DoorsVsWheels and #wheelsvsdoors hashtags to explain which side they were on.

In the gaming sphere, the popular online puzzle Wordle was the top trending game worldwide and in the U.S., according to Google Search. Wordle, which The New York Times purchased in January, is a seemingly simple puzzle, giving users six tries to guess a five-letter word that resets every day. There is no hint offered to start, but with each guess, the tiles turn green if the letters are in the right spot, yellow if they’re in the word but need to be moved, and remain unchanged if the letter is not in the word.

Wordle was also the top trending general ""search."" The game was so popular that it inspired a number of unofficial spinoffs. Four offshoots also made the top trending ""games"" category: Quordle, a version of Wordle that challenges players to solve four word puzzles at once; Heardle, a game that gives users six tries to guess a song; Worldle, a guess-the-country game that also gives users six tries; and Nerdle, a math equation guessing game.

But the biggest breakout search worldwide?

According to Google, the question most people wanted answered this year was: “Is the multiverse real?”",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/google-search-trending-topics-2022-johnny-depp-rcna60255,2022-12-07T08:05:01+00:00
284,"Lensa, the AI portrait app, has soared in popularity. But many artists question the ethics of AI art.","For many online, Lensa AI is a cheap, accessible profile picture generator. But in digital art circles, the popularity of artificial intelligence-generated art has raised major privacy and ethics concerns.

Lensa, which launched as a photo editing app in 2018, went viral last month after releasing its “magic avatars” feature. It uses a minimum of 10 user-uploaded images and the neural network Stable Diffusion to generate portraits in a variety of digital art styles. Social media has been flooded with Lensa AI portraits, from photorealistic paintings to more abstract illustrations. The app claimed the No. 1 spot in the iOS App Store’s “Photo & Video” category earlier this month.

But the app’s growth — and the rise of AI-generated art in recent months — has reignited discussion over the ethics of creating images with models that have been trained using other people’s original work.

Lensa is tinged with controversy — multiple artists have accused Stable Diffusion of using their art without permission. Many in the digital art space have also expressed qualms over AI models producing images en masse for so cheap, especially if those images imitate styles that actual artists have spent years refining.

For a $7.99 service fee, users receive 50 unique avatars — which artists said is a fraction of what a single portrait commission normally costs.

Companies like Lensa say they’re “bringing art to the masses,” said artist Karla Ortiz. “But really what they’re bringing is forgery, art theft [and] copying to the masses.”

Prisma Labs, the company behind Lensa, did not respond to requests for comment.

In a lengthy Twitter thread posted Tuesday morning, Prisma addressed concerns of AI art replacing art by actual artists.

“As cinema didn’t kill theater and accounting software hasn’t eradicated the profession, AI won’t replace artists but can become a great assisting tool,” the company tweeted. “We also believe that the growing accessibility of AI-powered tools would only make man-made art in its creative excellence more valued and appreciated, since any industrialization brings more value to handcrafted works.”

The company said that AI-generated images “can’t be described as exact replicas of any particular artwork.” The thread did not address accusations that many artists didn’t consent to the use of their work for AI training.

For some artists, AI models are a creative tool. Several have pointed out that the models are helpful for generating reference images that are otherwise difficult to find online. Other writers have posted about using the models to visualize scenes in their screenplays and novels. While the value of art is subjective, the crux of the AI art controversy is the right to privacy.

Ortiz, who is known for designing concept art for movies like “Doctor Strange,” also paints fine art portraits. When she realized that her art was included in a dataset used to train the AI model that Lensa uses to generate avatars, she said it felt like a “violation of identity.”

Prisma Labs deletes user photos from the cloud services it uses to process the images after it uses them to train its AI, the company told TechCrunch. The company’s user agreement states that Lensa can use the photos, videos and other user content for “operating or improving Lensa” without compensation.

In its Twitter thread, Lensa said that it uses a “separate model for each user, not a one-size-fits-all monstrous neural network trained to reproduce any face.” The company also stated that each user’s photos and “associated model” are permanently erased from its servers as soon as the user’s avatars are generated.

The fact that Lensa uses user content to further train its AI model, as stated in the app’s user agreement, should alarm the public, artists who spoke with NBC News said.

“We’re learning that even if you’re using it for your own inspiration, you’re still training it with other people’s data,” said Jon Lam, a storyboard artist at Riot Games. “Anytime people use it more, this thing just keeps learning. Anytime anyone uses it, it just gets worse and worse for everybody.”

Image synthesis models like Google Imagen, DALL-E and Stable Diffusion are trained using datasets of millions of images. The models learn associations between the arrangement of pixels in an image and the image’s metadata, which typically includes text descriptions of the image subject and artistic style.

The model can then generate new images based on the associations it has learned. When fed the prompt “biologically accurate anatomical description of a birthday cake,” for example, the model Midjourney generated unsettling images that looked like actual medical textbook material. Reddit users described the images as “brilliantly weird” and “like something straight out of a dream.”

The San Francisco Ballet even used images generated by Midjourney to promote this season’s production of the Nutcracker. In a press release earlier this year, the San Francisco Ballet’s chief marketing officer Kim Lundgren said that pairing the traditional live performance with AI-generated art was the “perfect way to add an unexpected twist to a holiday classic.” The campaign was widely criticized by artist advocacy groups. A spokesperson for the ballet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“The reason those images look so good is due to the nonconsensual data they gathered from artists and the public,” Ortiz said.

Ortiz is referring to the Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network (LAION), a nonprofit organization that releases free datasets for AI research and development. LAION-5B, one of the datasets used to train Stable Diffusion and Google Imagen, includes publicly available images scraped from sites like DeviantArt, Getty Images and Pinterest.

Many artists have spoken out against models that have been trained with LAION because their art was used in the set without their knowledge or permission. When an artist used the site Have I Been Trained, which allows users to check if their images were included in LAION-5B, she found her own face and medical records. Ars Technica reported that “thousands of similar patient medical record photos” were also included in the dataset.

“And now we are facing the same problem the music industry faced with websites like Napster, which was maybe made with good intentions or without thinking about the moral implications.” artist mateusz urbanowicz

Artist Mateusz Urbanowicz, whose work was also included in LAION-5B, said that fans have sent him AI-generated images that bear striking similarities to his watercolor illustrations.

It’s clear that LAION is “not just a research project that someone put on the internet for everyone to enjoy,” he said, now that companies like Prisma Labs are using it for commercial products.

“And now we are facing the same problem the music industry faced with websites like Napster, which was maybe made with good intentions or without thinking about the moral implications.”

The art and music industry abide by stringent copyright laws in the United States, but the use of copyrighted material in AI is legally murky. Using copyrighted material to train AI models might fall under fair use laws, The Verge reported. It’s more complicated when it comes to the content that AI models generate, and it’s difficult to enforce, which leaves artists with little recourse.

“They just take everything because it’s a legal gray zone and just exploiting it,” Lam said. “Because tech always moves faster than law, and law is always trying to catch up with it.”

There’s also little legal precedent for pursuing legal action against commercial products that use AI trained on publicly available material. Lam and others in the digital art space say they hope that a pending class action lawsuit against GitHub Copilot, a Microsoft product that uses an AI system trained by public code on GitHub, will pave the way for artists to protect their work. Until then, Lam said he’s wary of sharing his work online at all.

Lam isn’t the only artist worried about posting his art. After his recent posts calling out AI art went viral on Instagram and Twitter, Lam said that he received “an overwhelming amount” of messages from students and early career artists asking for advice.

The internet “democratized” art, Ortiz said, by allowing artists to promote their work and connect with other artists. For artists like Lam, who has been hired for most of his jobs because of his social media presence, posting online is vital for landing career opportunities. Putting a portfolio of work samples on a password-protected site doesn’t compare to the exposure gained from sharing it publicly.

“If no one knows your art, they’re not going to go to your website,” Lam added. “And it’s going to be increasingly difficult for students to get their foot in the door.”

Adding a watermark may not be enough to protect artists — in a recent Twitter thread, graphic designer Lauryn Ipsum listed examples of the “mangled remains” of artists’ signatures in Lensa AI portraits.

Some argue that AI art generators are no different from an aspiring artist who emulates another’s style, which has become a point of contention within art circles.

Days after illustrator Kim Jung Gi died in October, a former game developer created an AI model that generates images in the artist’s unique ink and brush style. The creator said the model was an homage to Kim’s work, but it received immediate backlash from other artists. Ortiz, who was friends with Kim, said that the artist’s “whole thing was teaching people how to draw,” and to feed his life’s work into an AI model was “really disrespectful.”

Urbanowicz said he’s less bothered by an actual artist who’s inspired by his illustrations. An AI model, however, can churn out an image that he would “never make” and hurt his brand — like if a model was prompted to generate “a store painted with watercolors that sells drugs or weapons” in his illustration style, and the image was posted with his name attached.

“If someone makes art based on my style, and makes a new piece, it’s their piece. It’s something they made. They learned from me as I learned from other artists,” he continued. “If you type in my name and store [in a prompt] to make a new piece of art, it’s forcing the AI to make art that I don’t want to make.”

Many artists and advocates also question if AI art will devalue work created by human artists.

Lam worries that companies will cancel artist contracts in favor of faster, cheaper AI-generated images.

Urbanowicz pointed out that AI models can be trained to replicate an artist’s previous work, but will never be able to create the art that an artist hasn’t made yet. Without decades of examples to learn from, he said, the AI images that looked just like his illustrations would never exist. Even if the future of visual art is uncertain as apps like Lensa AI become more common, he’s hopeful that aspiring artists will continue to pursue careers in creative fields.

“Only that person can make their unique art,” Urbanowicz said. “AI cannot make the art that they will make in 20 years.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/lensa-ai-artist-controversy-ethics-privacy-rcna60242,2022-12-06T23:30:38.255000+00:00
285,Lizzo is TikTok’s top music artist for 2022,"Lizzo was the queen of TikTok this year, as millions of users learned the choreography for “About Damn Time” and engaged with her other songs and videos. TikTok users also pushed “Jiggle Jiggle” and the “It’s corn!” kid to the top viral trends on the app in the U.S.

Lizzo, who has 26 million TikTok followers, was the No. 1 music artist on TikTok this year, based on total video views. “About Damn Time” was the app’s No. 4 top-trending song, and Lizzo’s TikTok video in which she demonstrates the dance for the hit song came in at seventh place on the trending-videos ranking, according to the company.

The No. 1 trending song in the U.S. was “Sunroof” by Nicky Youre and Dazy, with TikTok users making some 8.9 million videos featuring the track. “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)”, the 1985 song by Kate Bush that roared back on the charts after playing a key role in “Stranger Things 4,” was No. 10.

“Jiggle Jiggle,” the rap created more than two decades ago by documentary filmmaker Louis Theroux, gained a new life after it was remixed by DJ duo Duke & Jones (No. 8 on the top trending songs) and became a popular dance on TikTok created by English college students Jess Qualter and Brooke Blewitt. “Riverdale” stars Camila Mendes (Veronica Lodge), Lili Reinhart (Betty Cooper) and Madelaine Petsch (Cheryl Blossom) tapped into the craze on their joint TikTok account @blondebrunetteredhead, where their deadpan take on “Jiggle Jiggle” was the No. 4 trending video in the U.S. for the year.

In addition, Drew Barrymore and Lupita Nyong’o were among the top 10 U.S. “breakthrough” creators on TikTok, registering among the creators with the biggest growth on the platform for the year.

“We’re honored to celebrate our global community who shaped this year’s trends, shared new ideas, learned from one another, and turned their passions into careers and livelihoods throughout 2022,” Vanessa Pappas, TikTok’s chief operating officer, said in announcing the 2022 lists.

286,Why aluminum plants in the U.S. are far more polluting than some of their counterparts abroad,"This article was published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news outlet that covers climate, energy and the environment.

ROBARDS, Ky. — Shielded by protective hoods and covered by a hard outer crust, giant pots brimming with molten aluminum bubble gently in a series of long, metal buildings here that make up the smelter Century Aluminum Sebree. This is one of the country’s largest sources of a potent greenhouse gas that remains in the atmosphere for 50,000 years, tetrafluoromethane (CF4).

In 2021, this aluminum plant vented 23 tons of CF4 as well as a ton of hexafluoroethane — both are perfluorocarbons, or PFCs, that are among the most potent and longest-lasting greenhouse gases on the planet, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The pollution equals the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 40,000 automobiles, ones that will effectively remain on the metaphorical road for tens of thousands of years.

Meanwhile, a newer plant also owned and operated by Century Aluminum in Grundartangi, Iceland, emits just one-sixth the PFC emissions per ton of aluminum compared to the company’s Sebree plant, according to an Inside Climate News assessment of EPA data, as well as financial and environmental reports published by Century and Nordural, its Icelandic subsidiary.

It’s a tale of two smelters: older U.S. plants with some of the highest PFC emissions rates in the world and their overseas counterparts with far lower emissions — even when they are operated by the same multinational companies. The contrast highlights why the U.S. aluminum industry needs revitalization, environmental advocates say, even as it has declined precipitously in recent decades.

“They’re a shell of what they used to be, but that doesn’t mean they are allowed to be a huge polluter, just because they’re old,” said Nadia Steinzor, a policy and research consultant with the Environmental Integrity Project in Washington, D.C. “If there are technological fixes that the industry can employ to lower or eliminate climate emissions, they should be required to adopt them.”

In a case similar to that of Century Aluminum, Alcoa’s Intalco smelter in Ferndale, Washington, emitted nearly 50 tons of PFCs in 2020 before the company temporarily shut down production that same year, according to the EPA.

That’s in contrast to Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter in Fjarðabyggð, Iceland, which has a PFC emissions intensity less than one-fortieth that of the recently shuttered Intalco smelter, according to an Inside Climate News assessment of EPA data; the company’s production data, which was obtained through a public records request; and data the company publishes for its facility in Iceland.

Jim Beck, a spokesperson for Alcoa, said “we do not disagree” with the assessment. Beck added that emissions from the Intalco facility were high “due to the older technology and operational instability that the facility was experiencing.”

Century Aluminum offered a similar explanation for its Sebree plant, the largest U.S. aluminum production facility operating at full capacity, which was completed in 1973.

“It is important to note that the Iceland facility is a newer and more technologically advanced” facility, Steinunn Dögg Steinsen, the vice president of health safety and environment for Century Aluminum, said in an email. Steinsen added that the smelting process at the plant in Iceland is more automated, resulting in more efficient production, while the Sebree plant relies more on manual controls, which are less precise. “This explains most of the difference in PFC emission between the plants,” she said.

Although they are considered nontoxic by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, CF4 and hexafluoroethane belong to a class of synthetic, fluorine-containing chemicals known as “the immortals” because of how long they remain in the atmosphere. Once the gases are released, they are “essentially permanent additions to the atmosphere” and threaten “the public health and welfare of current and future generations,” the EPA notes.

However, unlike carbon dioxide, the primary driver of climate change, the EPA does not regulate PFCs.

American aluminum vs. Chinese aluminum

Twenty years ago, the U.S. led the world in aluminum production and in a worldwide effort to reduce PFCs, greenhouse gases that, pound for pound, are thousands of times worse for the climate than carbon dioxide, according to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Now, just 1.5% of global aluminum smelting, or production, takes place in the U.S. — but efforts to reduce PFC emissions in the U.S. have stalled, according to an Inside Climate News assessment of EPA data, while the cleanest smelters in other countries have brought emissions of the potent greenhouse gas down to near zero.

Industry experts say it may be too late to try to curb PFC emissions from existing U.S. smelters.

Aging U.S. smelters are like Model T cars, said Barry Welch, a chemical engineering professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, who has consulted for many of the world’s leading aluminum production companies.

“They are out of date,” Welch said of the current fleet of U.S. smelters, which were built from 1902 to 1980. “They should be shut down.”

Yet security experts say the U.S. must find a way to keep the aluminum plants open. The strong, lightweight metal is used to make more fuel-efficient cars and airplanes as well as solar panels and satellites.

“Just as we are reliant on the Middle East for oil, we will soon be in position where we will be reliant on China and Russia for aluminum,” said Joe Quinn, the vice president of strategic industrial materials at SAFE Commanding Heights, based in Washington, D.C., which advocates for U.S. energy security. “There is a legitimate need to stabilize the aluminum sector for national security reasons.”

In written testimony submitted to the U.S. International Trade Commission in 2017, Century Aluminum executives said aluminum producers were being “decimated” by “unfair practices of Chinese aluminum producers.”

“American smelters from New York, to Indiana, to Washington have already closed their doors, depriving local workers and communities of sorely needed jobs and tax revenue,” company officials wrote. “The continued viability of the aluminum industry outside of China, and especially in the United States, is dependent upon a prompt and effective solution to China’s overcapacity and overproduction.”

In 2018, President Donald Trump levied tariffs on imported aluminum. The tariffs remain largely in place. However, in June, Century announced it was temporarily shutting down production at its largest U.S. plant, an aluminum smelter in nearby Hawesville, Kentucky.

It was the only U.S. smelter to make high-purity “military grade” aluminum, used in fighter jets and in lightweight armor plating. Century said at the time that the closure would last “nine to twelve months” and that it was due to “soaring energy prices.”

Few industries have contracted as quickly and as completely as U.S. aluminum smelting.

“There were 23 operating in 2000 and five now,” Andy Thompson, the president of the local United Steelworkers of America union in Robards, said of the U.S.’s last remaining aluminum smelters.

Of the five remaining facilities, only the Century Aluminum Sebree plant in Robards, which employs 625 workers, and a smaller Alcoa plant in Massena, New York, run at full capacity.

Brad Schneider, the judge executive, or head of the county government, for Henderson County, which includes Robards, said that if the Century plant ever closed, it would be a significant loss for the region.

“Generations of people have worked there, the same families,” Schneider said. “It would be a definite blow.

“We’re all saddened by what happened to Hawesville,” he said. “If we don’t solve or at least protect our heavy industry and their energy needs, we’ll regret it. On multiple levels.”

Steinsen, of Century Aluminum, said the company has no plans to shut down its Sebree facility in Robards. “Sebree has unique operational and commercial advantages that Hawesville does not, and we are confident that Sebree is well positioned to continue operating,” Steinsen wrote.

A 76% drop in PFC emissions

Aluminum smelters turn alumina ore into aluminum by feeding alumina powder into a bath of molten salt and running large amounts of electricity through the mix in a cell, or “pot.”

If the concentration of the alumina dips too low, PFCs, an unwanted byproduct, can form quickly.

EPA officials first became aware of the issue in the early ’90s, yet rather than propose regulations, they worked with aluminum manufacturers to see whether they could find a way to reduce PFC emissions without regulations.

The result, the agency’s Voluntary Aluminum Industrial Partnership, which launched in 1995, was wildly successful. PFC emissions per ton of U.S. aluminum dropped by 76% from 1990 to 2015, according to the EPA.

“In addition to the environmental benefits, participation improves operational efficiency and benefits a company’s bottom line,” a 2008 EPA report concluded.

In 2015, when the U.S. aluminum production was in steep decline, the EPA ended its industry partnership. While the end of the program did not appear to have an impact on plant activities, the EPA did not respond to questions about why they do not regulate PFC emissions from aluminum plants or if they plan to in the future, and declined repeat requests to speak with an agency expert currently working on emissions policies. A spokesperson for the agency said, “EPA continues to track facility specific emissions from the aluminum industry through the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.”

Today, PFCs are a small fraction of aluminum production’s total greenhouse gas emissions. The vast majority, about 70%, come indirectly from burning fossil fuels in power plants to run the energy-intensive smelters, according to a 2019 study published in the Journal of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.

But the remaining PFC emissions are still significant. In 2019, 7,510 metric tons of PFCs were emitted from global aluminum production, according to a study published last year in the Journal of Geophysical Research — Atmospheres. That equals the annual emissions of 12.5 million automobiles, according to the EPA.

Aging technology and the Inflation Reduction Act

In May 1998, Alcan Aluminum, the former owner of what is now Century Aluminum Sebree, completed a $1.6 million investment in new equipment for the facility. Alcan installed a “demand feed” system that optimized the rate at which alumina was fed into the aluminum pots.

The investment cut the emissions intensity of CF4, the primary PFC emitted in aluminum production, in half, from 2 to 3 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per ton of aluminum to just over 1 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, according to a 1999 EPA report.

The emissions reduction made Alcan a climate leader among aluminum producers in the late ’90s. Twenty-four years later, the emissions intensity of CF4 from the plant remains virtually unchanged, at just under 1 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent per ton of aluminum, making Century, the current owner, a climate laggard.

Steinsen said the company has focused on reducing the PFC emissions intensity from the Sebree facility this year. New controls were added, and “we anticipate that these changes will reduce the plant’s PFC intensity,” Steinsen said.

The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act, the single biggest climate investment in U.S. history, made $5.8 billion in grants and other incentives available for heavy industry to adopt emissions-abating technologies. Aluminum manufacturers could use the money to install better control systems that reduce PFC emissions and increase production efficiency, said Quinn, of SAFE Commanding Heights, the U.S. energy security advocacy organization.

The act also appropriated $500 million for “enhanced” use of the Defense Production Act. Quinn said the additional money could be used to subsidize the cost of electricity to produce aluminum, which the act designated as a “critical mineral.”

The Inflation Reduction Act could breathe new life into the U.S. aluminum industry, said Mike Tanchuk, a veteran of the aluminum industry. With the backing of Blue Wolf Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and the AFL-CIO labor union federation, Tanchuk seeks to harness funds under the act as part of an effort to buy Alcoa’s Intalco smelter, upgrade its technology and power the facility with renewable energy to manufacture “green,” or low-carbon, aluminum.

“Potential federal funding from the Inflation Reduction Act and the continued support from Governor Inslee and other leaders in Washington state have revived my hope that Intalco can be saved,” said Tanchuk, the head of the recently formed company Green Aluminum — Intalco Works. (Jay Inslee is the governor of Washington.)

Beck, of Alcoa, said the company has participated in discussions with a prospective buyer, “although the various conditions for a successful sales transaction have not been met to date.”

Tanchuk previously worked as an executive for Alcoa, where he oversaw a prior reopening of the Intalco smelter in 2002, and at Century Aluminum, where he oversaw an expansion of the Nordural smelter in Iceland in 2006. He said technology upgrades at the Intalco plant would result in significantly reduced PFC emissions similar to those of the Nordural plant.

“The planned modernization of Intalco will result in a significant reduction of emissions, including greenhouse gases,” he said. “We still face some hurdles caused by recent geopolitical turmoil, such as high energy prices, but these events only reinforce my strong belief that now more than ever we need a reliable supply of domestic aluminum.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/aluminum-plants-us-are-far-polluting-counterparts-abroad-rcna57894,2022-12-06T10:00:35+00:00
287,Sen. Warren demands answers from Silvergate Bank about its business dealings with FTX,"When it came to pitching banking services to the crypto community, Silvergate Bank held an ace card: an endorsement from none other than Sam Bankman-Fried, the celebrity founder of FTX, a large and popular crypto exchange.

“Life as a crypto firm can be divided up into before Silvergate and after Silvergate,” Bankman-Fried gushed in a testimonial featured recently, and prominently, on Silvergate Bank’s website. “It’s hard to overstate how much it revolutionized banking for blockchain companies.”

Now, with billions of dollars missing from a bankrupt FTX’s coffers, Bankman-Fried’s tribute has vanished from San Diego-based Silvergate’s website. Silvergate’s role as a banker to FTX and other Bankman-Fried entities is raising questions for Alan Lane, its chief executive, and creating headaches for the institution’s public shareholders.

Late Monday, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Senate banking committee, and two Republican colleagues sent Lane and Silvergate a request for information about the bank’s relationship with FTX and the Bankman-Fried entities.

“In the weeks since FTX’s shocking collapse, new and disturbing allegations about the company’s business practices have continued to surface,” the letter said, “including the reports that Mr. Bankman-Fried ‘secretly transferred some $10 billion of customer funds to his trading vehicle, Alameda Research,’ to fund ‘risky bets,’ violating both U.S. securities laws and FTX’s own terms of service. We are concerned about Silvergate’s role in these activities because of reports suggesting that Silvergate facilitated the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda.”

The letter, co-signed by Republican Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Roger Marshall of Kansas, also questioned Silvergate’s vigilance in flagging suspicious activities in client accounts as it is required to do under banking regulations.

“Your bank’s involvement in the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda reveals what appears to be an egregious failure of your bank’s responsibility to monitor for and report suspicious financial activity carried out by its clients,” the letter said. Silvergate has until Dec. 19 to respond to the lawmakers.

Silvergate is one of only a handful of U.S. banks allowing customers to move dollars or other so-called fiat currencies onto crypto exchanges. FTX and related companies, including Alameda Research, its hedge fund and proprietary trading firm, held 20 different accounts at Silvergate, according to a recent FTX bankruptcy filing. Billions of dollars in wire transfers sluiced through Silvergate to FTX Group in recent years, according to a lawsuit filed against Bankman-Fried and his top executives.

It is not yet clear what transpired at FTX, Alameda and other affiliated entities or where the billions of dollars in missing customer funds wound up. But in a conversation with an investment manager, a former top FTX employee said Silvergate was FTX’s primary banking partner. In the conversation, a recording of which was shared with NBC News, the former employee described transfers of funds between FTX’s Silvergate account, which included FTX customers’ money, and accounts belonging to other entities believed to be controlled by Bankman-Fried, including Alameda Research, the supposedly separate crypto trading operation. The investment manager told NBC News he shared some of the former employee’s statements with members of the Senate banking committee.

FTX’s bankruptcy filings, public statements by Bankman-Fried and news reports raise questions about possible commingling of customers’ money and transfers of funds between FTX and Alameda.

“Silvergate appears to be at the center of the improper transfer of billions in FTX customer funds. Americans need answers. Those guilty of wrongdoing must be held accountable,” Sen. Warren said in a statement.

In response to the lawmakers’ letter, Silvergate provided this statement: “We received Senator Warren’s letter and look forward to answering her questions openly and transparently. Like many others, Silvergate was the victim of FTX’s and Alameda Research’s apparent misuse of customer assets and other lapses of judgment and we believe our full cooperation will help set the record straight about our role in the digital asset ecosystem.”

Citing client confidentiality and Silvergate’s status as a federally regulated financial institution, Lane declined to answer NBC News’ questions about the bank’s dealings with FTX, Alameda or other Bankman-Fried companies.

Late Monday, Lane put out a new statement describing the bank’s extensive due diligence process on FTX and Alameda, saying: “If we detect activity that is unexpected or potentially concerning in any account, we conduct an investigation and, when required, confidentially file a suspicious activity report in accordance with federal regulation.”

‘Duty of due diligence’

Silvergate’s customers are all institutional and include crypto exchanges, hedge funds, venture capital firms and other institutions that buy and sell digital currencies, its website and securities filings show. Silvergate has over 1,300 digital currency and fintech customers using its platform daily, it says. In 2017, it launched an instant money transfer system that operates 24/7, called the Silvergate Exchange Network, or SEN. Over that time, SEN has facilitated $1 trillion in transfers of U.S. dollars, the bank states.

In a recent news release addressing the FTX mess, Lane said his institution’s exposure to the FTX debacle is nominal, with FTX deposits totaling less than 10% of the bank’s almost $12 billion in digital deposits as of Sept. 30. “As a federally regulated banking institution that is well capitalized, we maintain a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity to support our customers’ needs,” Lane said.

Still, Silvergate’s potential exposure to the FTX crackup extends beyond the deposits it held for the company. Silvergate’s securities filings spell out the potential risks posed by associations with problematic clients. “If one of our customers (or in the case of digital currency exchanges, their customers) were to engage in or be accused of engaging in illegal activities using digital currency,” a filing states, “we could be subject to various fines and sanctions, including limitations on our activities, which could also cause reputational damage and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Silvergate is overseen by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the state of California and its deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. fund, its securities filings show. As a regulated bank, Silvergate has a duty to monitor clients’ accounts for suspicious activities that could signal fraud, money laundering or tax evasion, the filings note. Such crimes can be enabled through the use of digital currencies, the bank acknowledged in its filings, but Silvergate said its risk management and compliance framework “is reasonably designed to detect any such illicit activities conducted by our potential or existing customer.” Still, the bank conceded in those filings that it could not ensure its ability to uncover all such activities were they to occur.

Silvergate’s use of Bankman-Fried as a pitchman may also create potential legal risks, one securities law expert said. “If they’re advertising him on their website, they would have a more substantial duty of due diligence,” said Lewis D. Lowenfels, a prominent securities lawyer and co-author of the leading treatise on the nation’s securities laws. “They have a duty to make sure they are not stimulating a fraud.”

Crypto-driven deposits

Fifteen years ago, well before the crypto craze, Silvergate Bank was a small industrial loan company in San Diego with four branches, 40 employees and $300 million in assets, Lane has said in interviews. The bank dodged the mortgage meltdown of 2008, and with other lenders in disarray had no trouble attracting borrowers. Amassing deposits was harder, though, and as it battled larger and more established institutions for its share, in 2013, Lane said, he began to see the promise of crypto.

Buying and trading bitcoin was taking off, but other banks were avoiding the cryptocurrency business because risks of money laundering and other financial crimes had plagued the arena, Lane has acknowledged. In a 2019 podcast, he agreed when asked if Silvergate aimed to fill the crypto banking vacuum and ""drive deposits.”

Drive them he did. Silvergate’s deposits had grown to $13 billion in the September quarter, and its stock, issued to the public in 2019 at $12, soared to $217 in early November 2021 when the price of bitcoin hit a peak of almost $69,000. Then, Lane’s Silvergate holdings were worth an estimated $87.5 million based on data in regulatory filings. Now, with Silvergate’s stock down 89%, Lane’s stake, smaller as a result of some stock sales, has a value of $6.1 million.

Almost 40% of Silvergate’s deposits are from foreign entities, its filings state, without specifying the countries. This isn’t surprising in the crypto arena. Only 2% of FTX exchange customers were U.S.-based, a recent filing in the bankruptcy court shows. Fully one-third of FTX’s customers were from the Cayman Islands and the Virgin Islands, known tax havens, while customers from China, which has outlawed crypto transactions, totaled 8% of FTX customers.

A regulated institution, Silvergate must monitor its clients’ accounts for illegal activities, such as money laundering or tax evasion, and alert regulators to suspicious transactions. “Once the bank has established a customer relationship, it should be alert for unusual transactions,” states a manual published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the nation’s top bank regulators. Among the activities banks should watch for, the manual says, is an “unusual transfer of funds among related accounts, or accounts that involve the same or related principals.”

Banks are supposed to file what are known as suspicious activity reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) when they spot problematic transactions. But such filings are confidential and it could not be determined whether Silvergate had filed any of these reports regarding FTX. The lawmakers’ letter specifically asks if Silvergate filed suspicious activity reports about FTX, adding that a failure to do so may constitute a violation of the law.

FTX frequently used the Silvergate Exchange Network, according to the former FTX employee with direct knowledge of the transactions. Among the transactions described by the former employee were transfers of funds from FTX’s client account at Silvergate to accounts belonging to Alameda Research and other entities the employee believed were controlled by Bankman-Fried.

Bank compliance experts say large institutional clients like those that bank at Silvergate require intense due diligence because they are so complex and ownership can be obscure. For example, one expert said that multiple analysts would have been required to service just one large account like FTX’s to ensure against money laundering.

As the crypto craze has gone cold and several crypto currency exchanges have filed for bankruptcy, Lane has issued statements assuring investors that none of those failures will hurt its operations.

The bank also made a recent change in its internal risk oversight. On Nov. 7, a few days before FTX filed for bankruptcy, Silvergate named a new chief risk officer: Kathleen Fraher, previously the bank’s vice president, compliance and Bank Secrecy Act officer. Fraher replaced Tyler Pearson, a son-in-law of Silvergate CEO Lane who had been in that role. Pearson is now deputy chief risk officer at the bank. A Silvergate spokeswoman said the change reflected a shift in functions taken on by a new president at the bank.",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/elizabeth-warren-ftx-silvergate-bank-crypto-rcna60147,2022-12-06T11:30:31+00:00
288,"Hackers linked to Chinese government stole millions in Covid benefits, Secret Service says","Hackers linked to the Chinese government stole at least $20 million in U.S. Covid relief benefits, including Small Business Administration loans and unemployment insurance funds in over a dozen states, according to the Secret Service.

The theft of taxpayer funds by the Chengdu-based hacking group known as APT41 is the first instance of pandemic fraud tied to foreign, state-sponsored cybercriminals that the U.S. government has acknowledged publicly, but may just be the tip of the iceberg, according to U.S. law enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts.

The officials and experts, most speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject matter, say other federal investigations of pandemic fraud also seem to point back to foreign state-affiliated hackers.

“It would be crazy to think this group didn’t target all 50 states,” said Roy Dotson, national pandemic fraud recovery coordinator for the Secret Service, who also acts as a liaison to other federal agencies probing Covid fraud.

The Secret Service declined to confirm the scope of other investigations, saying there are more than 1,000 ongoing investigations involving transnational and domestic criminal actors defrauding public benefits programs, and APT41 is “a notable player.”

And whether the Chinese government directed APT41 to loot U.S. taxpayer funds or simply looked the other way, multiple current and former U.S. officials say, the theft itself is a troubling development that raises the stakes. One senior Justice Department official called it “dangerous” and said it had serious national security implications.

“I’ve never seen them target government money before,” said John Hultquist, the head of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant. “That would be an escalation.”

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

‘The horse is out of the barn’

As soon as state governments began disbursing Covid unemployment funds in 2020, cybercriminals began to siphon off a significant percentage.

The Labor Department Office of Inspector General has reported an improper payment rate of roughly 20% for the $872.5 billion in federal pandemic unemployment funds, though the true cost of the fraud is likely higher, administration officials from multiple agencies say.

In-depth analysis of four states showed 42.4% of pandemic benefits were paid improperly in the first six months, the department’s watchdog reported to Congress last week.

A Heritage Foundation analysis of Labor Department data estimated excess unemployment benefits payments of more than $350 billion from April 2020 to May 2021.

“Whether it’s 350, 400 or 500 billion, at this point, the horse is out of the barn,” said Linda Miller, the former deputy executive director of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, the federal government’s Covid relief fraud watchdog.

By the time Covid relief funds appeared as a target of opportunity in 2020, APT41, which emerged more than a decade ago, had already become the “workhorse” of cyberespionage operations that benefit the Chinese government, according to cyber experts and current and former officials from multiple agencies. The Secret Service said in a statement that it considers APT41 a “Chinese state-sponsored, cyberthreat group that is highly adept at conducting espionage missions and financial crimes for personal gain.”

Ambassador Nathaniel Fick, the head of the State Department’s Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, said cyberespionage is a long-time Chinese national priority aimed at strengthening its geopolitical position.

“The United States is target No. 1, because we are competitor No. 1,” Fick told NBC News. “It’s a really comprehensive, multi-decade, well-considered, well-resourced, well-planned, well-executed strategy.”

American officials have blamed Chinese hackers for the Office of Personnel Management, the Anthem Health and the Equifax breaches, among others.

The experts and officials describe the Chinese model of “state-sponsored” hackers as a network of semi-independent groups conducting contract work in service of government espionage. The Chinese government may direct a hacking group to attack a certain target. APT41, also known to cybersecurity firms as Winnti, Barium and Wicked Panda, fits the model and is considered a particularly prolific Chinese intelligence asset, known to commit financial crimes on the side.

Demian Ahn, a former assistant U.S. attorney who indicted five APT41 hackers in 2019 and 2020, said the evidence showed the group had tremendous reach and resources. The defendants, who were accused of infiltrating governments and companies around the world while conducting ransomware attacks and mining cryptocurrency, talked “about having tens of thousands of machines at one time, as part of their efforts to obtain information about others, and also to generate criminal profits.” None of the five Chinese nationals indicted have been extradited, and the cases remain open.

APT41’s intrusion methods have included hacking legitimate software and weaponizing it against innocent users, including businesses and governments. Another tactic involves tracking public disclosures about security flaws in legitimate software. APT41 uses that information to target customers who don’t immediately update their software, according to a former Justice Department official familiar with the group.

The primary purpose of APT41’s state-directed activity, the experts and officials say, is believed to be collecting personally identifying information and data about American citizens, institutions and businesses that can be used by China for espionage purposes.

“They have the patience, the sophistication and the resources to carry out hacking that has a direct impact on national security,” said a former Justice Department official familiar with the group.

Law enforcement officials and counterintelligence experts have testified to Congress that by now, every adult American has had all or most of their personal data stolen by the Chinese government.

‘Wild West’

Beijing has increasingly turned its focus to breaching U.S. critical infrastructure in recent years, say current and former officials and China and cybersecurity experts, with worldwide campaigns driven by APT41.

China’s targets include state governments, which can have inadequate cybersecurity defenses. “The state governments don’t allocate a lot of cyber protection money to their state IT infrastructure,” said William Evanina, the former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. “So it’s really an unprotected Wild West.”

The Covid fraud scheme that the Secret Service has publicly linked to APT41 began in mid-2020 and spanned 2,000 accounts associated with more than 40,000 financial transactions.

“Where their sophistication comes in is the ability to work heavily and quickly,” the agency's Dotson said.

The agency said it has been able to recover about half of the stolen $20 million in the APT41 case.

Overall, the Secret Service said that as of August it had seized more than $1.4 billion in fraudulently obtained Covid relief funds and helped return about $2.3 billion to state unemployment insurance programs.

But while Evanina and other officials and experts consider APT41’s breach of state systems a national security issue, they aren’t convinced that stealing Covid funds was a goal of the Chinese government. Such thefts increase the risk of criminal prosecution and make it harder for China to obscure the state’s role. They believe that the Chinese government may have simply tolerated the hackers making a profit off their labors.

Many believe the hackers are still inside state information technology systems.

Mandiant, which contracts with more than 75 state and local government organizations and agencies, issued a report in March that the APT41 had infiltrated six — and likely more — state governments using back doors in popular software and was exfiltrating data on citizens.

Hultquist said in an interview that Mandiant analysts discovered at least two occasions involving interactions with servers associated with state benefits after May 2021.

Current officials would not comment about whether APT41 still had access to state government networks after being discovered last year.

The Labor Department, the Small Business Administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the White House all declined to comment and referred NBC News to the Justice Department. The FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.

“Once you are in these systems with intent to promulgate theft"" of personally identifying information, Evanina said, ""you’re in forever,” noting that at the state and local levels, many disparate systems share an interconnected domain. “Unless,” he said, “you tear down the systems and replace everything.”

State agencies across the country continue to struggle against invisible online attackers, many lacking the proper funding and expertise to secure their online benefits systems.

“If we can come together and really have open and honest conversations about what works well and what went very wrong, we would just be in a much better place to stop this,” said Maryland Labor Secretary Tiffany Robinson, who said her state’s system is still bogged down by thousands of fraudulent applications and phone calls each week. “Because this is not over.”

Federal officials acknowledge they are nowhere close to fully accounting for what really happened to benefits programs in the pandemic.

“A lot of these criminals, we’ll never be able to indict and locate,” said a federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of fraud investigations involving China-based hackers. “With the internet and the dark web, it’s borderless.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/chinese-hackers-covid-fraud-millions-rcna59636,2022-12-05T11:30:33+00:00
289,"What's in the 'magic spray' World Cup players use, and does it really work?","Viewers of the World Cup are likely familiar with the “magic spray” that sometimes gets whipped out after a player tumbles to the ground, writhing in pain from a mid-game injury.

The aerosolized substance garners renewed intrigue every so often, when team doctors douse players with it and then send them back into action, seemingly healed. So, how does the spray work, and just how magical is it?

The sprays commonly used in these settings don’t actually do any healing, according to experts. Rather, they offer temporary chilling and numbing to dull pain.

What’s in the bottle varies from brand to brand, but the sprays usually contain ethyl chloride, a prescription medication used as a topical antiseptic and cooling substance, or methyl salicylate, a counter-irritant that can cause a cold-and-hot feeling and is commonly found in over-the-counter rubs like Bengay.

“It’s providing a little bit of temporary anesthetic or numbing or freezing of the skin,” said Dr. Shane Davis, a physiatrist specializing in nonoperative sports medicine at Tufts Medical Center. “It’s a lot like if you put an ice pack on — you lose sensation of that area, it calms down the pain.”

The relief lasts just a few seconds to a couple of minutes, Davis said, but it’s enough to get a player over that initial pain. Other pain relief interventions like ice packs require more time to take effect, but in a game, players often can’t afford to spend 10 or 15 minutes on the sidelines.

For some players, the spray may also have a placebo effect. And by the time it wears off, the adrenaline of being back in the game might further mask some of the discomfort.

It’s common for soccer players to take impacts in bony areas, which can cause pain but don’t often lead to lasting injuries. But if a player suffers a fracture or tear, cold spray might do more harm than good.

“If there is concern for structural damage or concern that the athlete could make things worse, that’s where the decision would be to pull that athlete out,” said Mitch Therriault, a physical therapist in sports medicine at Ohio State Wexner Medical Center. “But if it’s something that’s more minor or more of a short-term pain … that’s where this [spray] comes into play.”

Experts also said the sprays are not for use on open wounds.

“Magic spray” is more commonly used in soccer than other contact sports, but not all teams rely on it. The U.S. Soccer Federation, the organization that governs the Men’s and Women’s National Teams, does not use magic spray, a spokesperson told NBC News.

“Some guys actually don’t need it and don’t ever ask for the cold spray, but some guys have gotten accustomed to using it and know it helps them,” said Sam Cervantes, the athletic trainer for men’s soccer at the University of Pittsburgh. “It’s not something that I’m going to jump to, but if somebody asked for it, I’ll certainly provide it for them.”

Outside the sports world, physicians sometimes use sprays like ethyl chloride to numb an injection site before inserting a needle.

The general public can find versions of these sprays at drug stores or online, sold as “Cold Spray” or “Pain Relief Spray” by brands like Cramer or MyDerm.

Cervantes said cold sprays can pose risks when applied by untrained users, though: Their freezing properties can damage the skin when applied for too long, and the products should not be used on people with conditions that make them vulnerable to cold or that impair their skin sensation.

He added that he doesn’t think the pain relief the spray offers World Cup players is very different than the experience anyone has after rubbing their shin for a few moments following a collision with a table or dresser.

“That’s kind of the funny thing about it,” Cervantes said. “There’s really no magic to the spray.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/magic-spray-world-cup-soccer-rcna59872,2022-12-02T22:46:31.949000+00:00
290,Drug deaths among pregnant women hit a record high,"The number of pregnant women and new mothers dying from drug overdoses grew dramatically as the pandemic took hold, reaching a record high in 2020, a new study finds.

The research, published Tuesday in JAMA, provides a stark look at how substance use disorder is harming pregnant people who are less likely than others to seek or receive help for a dependency on opioids and other drugs.

""Drug use is incredibly stigmatized in general,"" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. ""It goes to an ever higher level of stigma among pregnant women.""

Researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health looked at the death certificates of 7,642 people who died while pregnant or had just given birth from 2017 through 2020. Of those, 1,249 died of a drug overdose — usually from methamphetamine, cocaine or the synthetic opioid fentanyl.

During that time, the rate of overdose deaths in that group nearly doubled, from 6.56 to 11.85 per 100,000. And the rate of overdose deaths particularly sped up in 2020, said Emilie Bruzelius, a doctoral candidate of epidemiology at Columbia. She does not work with pregnant women or those with substance use disorder, but did crunch the numbers for the new research.

""When you stop and take a minute and think about those 1,200 deaths, it's incredibly sad,"" she said.

Drug overdoses of women in their childbearing years in general also increased, especially during 2020, Bruzelius's study found.

While the rate of overdose deaths among women of childbearing age was higher — 19.76 per 100,000 in 2020, compared with 14.37 per 100,000 in 2017 — the rate of increase was much faster among pregnant women and those who’d given birth within the previous year.

Dr. Tricia Wright, an obstetrician and addiction medicine expert at the University of California, San Francisco, was unsurprised by the latest research.

""Overdose deaths in general have increased, and pregnant women aren't immune to the effects of addiction,"" Wright said.

Medications to help drug withdrawal

Opioid use among pregnant women has been skyrocketing for more than a decade, increasing by 131% from 2010 to 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Left untreated, their babies are more likely to be born too early and at a low birth rate, and must go through drug withdrawal that can last for weeks.

Medications like methadone and buprenorphine to treat the disorder can be used safely in pregnant women and greatly increases the chances mom will carry the baby to full term, said Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and director of the Vanderbilt Center for Child Health Policy in Nashville.

""It's not even a question. We know — convincingly — that outcomes are better with these medications,"" he said. He was not involved with the new research.

Even doctors who treat opioid use disorder may be unlikely to help a woman if she's pregnant. Patrick led a 2020 study that found pregnant women who called treatment centers were less likely than other women to get an appointment.

""Oftentimes what we find is addiction medicine doctors not comfortable taking care of pregnant women, and obstetricians not comfortable taking care of addiction,"" Patrick said. Pregnant people are left stuck in the middle.

The pandemic worsened the situation.

""Pregnant women became even more vulnerable during Covid because access to treatments for anything that wasn't Covid went down,"" said Dr. Anna Lembke, a professor of psychiatry and addiction medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.

""So now you've got a population of patients who already have barriers to treatment, are reluctant to access treatment, and then access to treatment isn't readily available,"" Lembke said. She was not involved in the new study.

""At the same time, fentanyl was increasing everywhere throughout the country,"" Wright said. ""It was kind of a perfect storm.""

A Biden administration report, released in October, called for broader access to opioid treatment medication among pregnant women and de-stigmatize addiction treatment during pregnancy.

""The power of stigma is exceptional,"" Patrick said. ""It drives people away from treatment, and kills them.""

291,People lost more weight when they were offered cash incentives,"Offering people cash can help them shed excess pounds, a study published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine finds.

Participants who were offered cash incentives for either pounds lost or for completing certain activities were more likely to lose weight compared with those who were simply offered tools, such as diet books, fitness trackers and access to a weight loss program, the study found.

The patients in the study were low income — a group that tends to have a tougher time losing weight, said senior study author Dr. Melanie Jay, the co-director of NYU Langone Health’s Comprehensive Program on Obesity in New York City. “Forty percent of Americans have obesity and the prevalence is higher in people from low income and minoritized populations,” she said.

When it comes to weight loss, “there are a lot of barriers for those with low incomes,” Jay said, including lack of access to healthy foods or a gym, and the time needed for exercise.

Giving people the tools and information to lose weight often isn’t sufficient.

“One thing we continuously struggle with is keeping patients engaged,” said Colleen Tewksbury, an assistant professor of nutrition science at the University of Pennsylvania and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

“This shows giving people tools, such as scales and ways to track eating and exercise, might not be enough,” said Tewksbury, who was not involved with the new research. “They might need financial incentives.”

Cash for weight loss

To explore whether financial incentives could help people lose excess pounds, Jay and her colleagues recruited 688 patients, ages 18 to 70, with obesity (body mass index greater than or equal to 30), who were seeing a doctor at either Bellevue Hospital or NYU Langone Brooklyn, both in New York City, or Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.

The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. All were given a year’s membership to WW Freestyle (formerly known as Weight Watchers), a Fitbit, health education, a food diary to keep track of what they ate, a scale and monthly one-on-one check-in visits. For the control group, no other intervention was added.

The remaining participants were split into two groups: the outcome-based group, which received payments based on the percentage of weight lost; or the goal-directed group, which received payments for sticking with certain weight loss behaviors, such as attending weekly program sessions, maintaining a food diary at least five days a week, and getting at least 75 minutes of physical activity each week.

Participants in both groups could earn up to $750.

The participants were mostly female, 81%, and Hispanic, 72.6%. The average weight of the participants was about 218 pounds at the start of the study. At six months, 22.1% of the patients in the control group lost at least 5% of their initial body weight, compared with 39% of those in the goal-directed group and 49.1% of those in the outcome-based group.

On average, participants in the goal-directed group earned $440.44, as compared to $303.56 in the outcome-based group.

Although more of the outcome-based group lost 5% of their body weight over six months than the goal-directed group, Jay believes that the goal-directed approach may turn out to have more lasting effects because it’s teaching people healthy habits.

“Even if less weight is lost, adopting lifelong physical activity or better eating habits may be more important,” she said.

Dr. Robert Kushner, a nutrition and weight management specialist and a professor at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said it was very impressive that the study participants were able to manage their weight better and get healthier.

Kushner, who was not involved with the new study, agreed that low-income people face extra challenges when it comes to weight loss. He sees similar patients in his practice.

“They have a difficult time changing their behaviors because of all the other life challenges they face,” he said.

What’s not clear, however, is how the strategy of offering cash for weight loss could be implemented in a real-world setting, outside of academia. “Politically and culturally we’re going to be hard-pressed to pay people to get healthy,” Kushner said. “There are a lot of headwinds.”

Still, he noted, “insurance companies have used similar approaches, by lowering premiums or offering extra memberships for people who lose weight.”

Tewksbury said she suspects that organizations that pay for health care might be open to this kind of strategy.

“It may be a great opportunity for employers, health insurers, government agencies like Medicare and Medicaid,” she said. “Anyone currently spending money on health care costs could benefit by leveraging this strategy to lower health care costs.”

292,"RSV is peaking but flu hospitalizations highest in a decade, CDC says","The spread of RSV appears to be slowing, though Covid cases have risen since Thanksgiving and flu hospitalizations remain at a decade high, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Monday.

""This year’s flu season is off to a rough start,"" Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, board chair of the American Medical Association, said at a CDC press briefing. ""Flu is here. It started early, and with Covid and RSV also circulating, it’s a perfect storm for a terrible holiday season.""

Approximately 78,000 people have been hospitalized with the flu since the start of October. Around 19,500 were newly hospitalized in the week ending Nov. 27, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services — nearly double the number of flu hospitalizations reported the week prior.

The CDC estimates that the flu has already caused 8.7 million illnesses since Oct. 1. That's close to the 9 million cases estimated for the entire 2021-22 flu season.

Flu deaths are already approaching last season's total as well: The CDC estimates this year's toll to be at least 4,500 since Oct. 1, compared to 5,000 in all of last season.

The combined burden of these viruses is straining hospital capacity nationwide. Around 79% of U.S. hospital inpatient beds are full, according to HHS data.

However, cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have most likely peaked in some parts of the country, such as the South and Southeast, and plateaued in the Mid-Atlantic, New England and Midwest, Walensky said.

Nationally, the number of positive weekly RSV tests fell from more than 19,000 in the week ending Nov. 12 to around 7,500 in the week ending Nov. 26.

Average daily Covid cases, however, have risen 16% over the last two weeks, according to NBC News' tally. The CDC recorded a nearly 18% increase in average daily hospital admissions due to Covid from the week ending Nov. 22 to the week ending Nov. 29.

Walensky said the uptick ""is especially worrisome as we move into the winter months, when more people are assembling indoors with less ventilation, and as we approach the holiday season when many are gathering with loved ones and across multiple generations.""

Since the three viruses have many symptoms in common — including runny nose, cough, congestion and sore throat — Fryhofer noted that it can be difficult to diagnose a patient right away. Unlike Covid tests, RSV and flu tests must be performed at a doctor’s office or ordered via prescription.

""It is going to be a confusing respiratory infection season. Figuring out what’s making people sick is going to be a conundrum,"" Fryhofer said.

Walensky said the most important way to protect oneself from these viruses is to stay up to date on Covid vaccines and the annual flu shot. There is no vaccine yet to prevent RSV.

CDC data suggests that people who have received updated Covid boosters were less likely to die than those who were vaccinated but had not received a new booster. The bivalent boosters also seem to lower one's chance of a Covid infection relative to the original shots.

Fryhofer said flu vaccines are also a good match for circulating strains this year.

But Walensky pointed out that some groups with the highest rates of flu hospitalization — those who are pregnant, under age 5 or over 65 — have lower vaccination rates now compared to the same time last year. Flu vaccination rates among pregnant women are about 12% lower than last season, she said.

Walensky recommended that people wear masks if they are traveling by plane, train, bus or other forms of public transportation; if they are immunocompromised or at increased risk for severe disease; or if they live in counties with high Covid levels.

She added that the CDC is looking into the possibility of officially recommending masks in some counties based on the overall spread of respiratory viruses — not just Covid — but that ""one need not wait for CDC action in order to put a mask on.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rsv-peaking-covid-rising-flu-hospitalizations-high-cdc-rcna60126,2022-12-05T20:02:47.126000+00:00
293,"Myocarditis after Covid vaccine low among teens and young adults, large study finds","The incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after Covid vaccination is low and most patients make a full recovery, a large international study from Nationwide Children’s Hospital found.

Most of the cases occurred in male teens and young adults and usually after the second dose of a primary series of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.

Although a majority of the people recovered quickly, 93% of the cases required hospitalization and 23% of the cases were serious enough to require admission to the intensive care unit. No deaths were observed.

While the study’s findings are “reassuring,” the vaccine-associated heart problems “should not be viewed as always mild,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.

The findings confirm earlier studies that found myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, an inflammation of the outer lining of the heart, following Covid vaccination are rare.

But many of those studies, the authors wrote, relied on self-reporting to safety surveillance systems and contained populations from certain countries, where people may have similar risk factors.

Researchers at Nationwide Children’s Hospital reviewed 23 peer-reviewed studies through August across multiple locations, including the U.S., Hong Kong, South Korea and countries in Europe.

The review included more than 800 teens and young adults who developed myocarditis and pericarditis following Covid vaccination.

The heart-related conditions usually occurred within four days after the second dose of a Covid vaccine, the study found.

What are myocarditis symptoms?

The most common symptoms were:

Chest pain

Fever

Headache

Shortness of breath

Levels of troponin, specific proteins that may indicate issues with the heart, including heart injury, were elevated in about 84% of the patients, according to the study.

Most patients recovered with rest and medication. However, 87% had abnormalities on their cardiac MRI, raising the question of whether there may be long-term consequences to the condition, Barouch said.

Pfizer and Moderna are both conducting long-term clinical trials to track health issues — if any — in the years following a diagnosis of vaccine-associated heart problems in teens and young adults.

The research has limitations, including that some of the studies reviewed were observational, meaning that they can't prove cause and effect. The researchers were also unable to determine whether the timing between doses influenced the incidence of the condition. (Studies have found that a wider gap between doses may reduce the risk of the inflammation condition.)

It also doesn't address what makes young men more susceptible to the heart-related health conditions, although some experts expect the virus’s spike protein, once produced in the cell after vaccination, may generate a reaction in the body that can cause inflammation in the heart.

Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University, said he would still like to see estimates of myocarditis risk by age, gender, vaccine type and spacing between doses.

The study's authors said that the overall incidence of myocarditis following Covid vaccination was consistent with estimates from the U.S. and Israel, which found the occurrence of the condition to be low at 0.3 to 5 cases per 100,000 vaccinated people.

It’s important to note that Covid vaccines are not the only vaccinations that have been linked to myocarditis, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

It’s also been seen after smallpox vaccination, he said, though the number of cases may appear higher after Covid vaccines because “we’re paying so much more attention.”

The authors also noted that the risk of developing myocarditis after Covid infection is significantly higher than after vaccination.

294,New coronavirus variants made monoclonal antibody drugs ineffective,"No more monoclonal antibody treatments for Covid are available in the U.S.: The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday rescinded its authorization of bebtelovimab, a drug previously given to patients who faced a high risk of severe disease.

Over the last two years, the FDA authorized six monoclonal antibody treatments for Covid, but omicron’s many subvariants rendered the drugs less effective so the FDA gradually revoked each of those authorizations. Bebtelovimab, made by Eli Lilly, was the last one standing.

According to the FDA's announcement, the drug was ""not expected to neutralize Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.,"" which together now account for the majority of new infections recorded in the U.S. — around 62%, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

""The big problem is that monoclonal antibodies bind to a very small piece of the virus. As the virus changes, we are now in a position in which we lost them all because they don’t bind to the virus anymore,"" said Dr. Arturo Casadevall, a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Paxlovid has become the go-to treatment for most people at high risk of severe Covid, given that it continues to be effective in the face of new variants and is easy to administer (it's a series of three pills taken twice daily for five days). Bebtelovimab, by contrast, was an IV infusion that took about an hour.

But doctors often recommended the monoclonal antibody for people taking certain immunosuppressive medications, such as cancer patients or transplant recipients, since Paxlovid can interact negatively with several of those drugs.

Dr. Rodney Rohde, chair of the Clinical Laboratory Science Program at Texas State University, said he worries about how immunocompromised patients will fare with fewer treatment options.

""There are still segments of the population that have probably very little protection,"" he said. ""You worry about that last push of this virus this winter and going to the spring, if we see higher mortality or hospital beds being filled.""

In the spring, when the BA.2 omicron subvariant was dominant, research from Raymund Razonable, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, showed that bebtelovimab was as effective as Paxlovid at preventing severe disease among high-risk Covid patients. But Razonable said his hospital switched to Paxlovid as the primary treatment over the summer as new subvariants began to spread.

About two months ago, he said, doctors began asking patients who got bebtelovimab to report back if their symptoms hadn't improved in one or two days. By the time the FDA revoked the treatment's authorization, the Mayo Clinic had already stopped administering it, Razonable said, since doctors assumed it was no longer effective against BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.

Razonable said Mayo Clinic patients who are at high risk of severe Covid but can't take Paxlovid are now offered the antiviral drug remdesivir at the infusion center where the hospital previously gave monoclonal antibodies. But remdesivir infusions are given over three days, so patients need multiple appointments.

Another option for immunocompromised people is convalescent plasma, which is derived from the donated blood of people who have already recovered from Covid. Casadevall said convalescent plasma is an effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies, but it's more complicated to administer and oversee.

""It has thousands of different antibodies, so convalescent plasma has a lot of breadth that is not found in the monoclonals,"" he said.

Pharma companies haven't given up on the promise of new monoclonal antibody drugs, however.

""We remain strong in our belief that [monoclonal antibodies] have a critical role in the current fight against Covid-19, particularly in high-risk individuals,"" said a spokesperson for Vir Biotechnology, the company behind a monoclonal antibody called sotrovimab that was formerly authorized by the FDA.

A spokesperson for Eli Lilly said the company is searching for and evaluating monoclonal antibody candidates. AstraZeneca, meanwhile, is developing a new antibody cocktail that it hopes to make available by the end of next year, a company spokesperson said.

The FDA authorized AstraZeneca’s monoclonal antibody drug Evusheld in December 2021 not as a treatment for Covid, but as a way to prevent infection in immunocompromised people who may not develop a strong antibody response to vaccines. But in October, the FDA announced that Evusheld may not be effective against circulating variants, and Razonable said his hospital is preparing for its authorization to be revoked soon.

""Looking at the distribution of variants currently, Evusheld is effective maybe about 30% of the time,"" he said.

Casadevall said new monoclonal antibody drugs are still worth pursuing, since they have proven safe and effective against Covid.

“I would not give up on something like this,"" he said. ""I think it is possible to find antibodies that will be active with the other variants.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-variants-monoclonal-antibody-drugs-ineffective-rcna59797,2022-12-03T11:30:36+00:00
295,"Amid outcry, San Francisco pauses on ‘killer police robots’","SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco supervisors voted Tuesday to put the brakes on a controversial policy that would have let police use robots for deadly force, reversing course just days after their approval of the plan generated fierce pushback and warnings about the militarization and automation of policing.

The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to explicitly ban the use of robots in such a fashion for now. But they sent the issue back to a committee for further discussion and could vote in the future to let police use robots in a lethal manner in limited cases.

The board voted last week to allow the use of deadly robots in extreme circumstances. The police department said it had no plans to arm the robots with guns but wanted the ability to put explosives on them and use then to contact, incapacitate or disorient dangerous or armed suspects when lives are at risk.

The initial vote thrust the famously liberal city into the center of a debate about the future of technology and policing, with some saying arming robots was a step too close to something one would see in a dystopian science fiction movie. Though robot technology for policing has become more widely available, departments across the country have rarely used it to confront or kill suspects.

Three supervisors who rejected the policy from the beginning joined dozens of protesters Monday outside City Hall to urge the board to change course. They chanted and held signs with phrases like “We all saw that movie... No Killer Robots.”

Supervisor Dean Preston was among them, and on Tuesday he told his colleagues the public hadn’t been given enough time to voice their concerns about such a pressing issue.

“The people of San Francisco have spoken loud and clear: There is no place for killer police robots in our city,” he said in a statement after the vote. “We should be working on ways to decrease the use of force by local law enforcement, not giving them new tools to kill people.”

The vote was the result of a new state law that requires police departments to inventory equipment including certain guns, grenades, armored vehicles and battering rams and to seek explicit approval for their use. So far, only San Francisco and Oakland have discussed lethal robots as part of that law. Oakland police wanted to arm robots with shotguns but backed down in the face of public opposition, instead opting for pepper spray.

Some San Francisco officials wanted to proceed with allowing robots to use deadly force in certain cases, arguing nothing substantive had changed to warrant a reversal. But the vote to advance the broader police equipment policy — including the ban on lethal robots — passed unanimously.

It still allows police to use robots to check out potentially dangerous scenes so that officers can stay back.

“Having robots that have eyes and ears and can remove bombs, which happens from time to time, is something that we want the police department to do while we continue to have this very controversial discussion,” said Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who brought forward last week’s motion around the use of robots.

In a civil complaint released Monday, state inspectors said Moorhead, Minn.-based Northland Vapor sold edible cannabinoid products that contained as much as 100 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) per serving, in packages containing a total of 2,500 milligrams of THC.

State law limits THC-based products to five milligrams per serving or 50 milligrams per package.

In connection with the state's lawsuit, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received complaints about ""serious adverse events"" associated with Northland Vapor’s “Death by Gummy Bears” delta-8 THC products, including a death. The FDA has not determined whether the products caused the adverse events, the Minnesota regulators said.

""To protect the public, the Board of Pharmacy embargoed this noncompliant product and is seeking an order from the court to destroy the noncompliant product,"" the complaint states.

The regulators said they were also asking the court to prevent Northland from continuing to manufacture and sell edible cannabinoid products that violate state law. The estimated retail value of the products targeted for embargo exceeds $7 million, the complaint states.

According to Minnesota Public Radio, Minnesota's Board of Pharmacy has investigated 46 complaints since a law allowing consumer THC product sales in the state went into effect in July. This is the first time it has gone to court to stop products from being sold, the station reported. It cited experts who said the high THC doses being sold by Northland are “intensely intoxicating” and should be consumed “with caution and intention.”

A lawyer representing Northland said in a statement that the company is a small, family-owned business that employs more than 60 people, and that it has been in operation for nearly a decade.

According to a statement, Northland said it attempted to work with the state to ensure it was complying with state law, but said that ""someone decided Northland should be made an example.""

“The State’s attempts to smear Northland’s reputation and aggressive tactics go beyond belief,” it said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/minnesota-sues-weed-edibles-company-says-sold-products-50-powerful-all-rcna60413,2022-12-07T02:14:14.255000+00:00
297,"Sale jumpstarts floating, offshore wind power in U.S. waters","PORTLAND, Ore. — Tuesday marks the first-ever U.S. auction of leases to develop commercial-scale floating wind farms, in the deep waters off the West Coast.

The live, online auction for the five leases — three off California’s central coast and two off its northern coast — has attracted strong interest and 43 companies from around the world are approved to bid. The wind turbines will float roughly 25 miles offshore.

The growth of offshore wind comes as climate change intensifies and need for clean energy grows. It also is getting cheaper. The cost of developing offshore wind has dropped 60% since 2010 according to a July report by the International Renewable Energy Agency. It declined 13% in 2021 alone.

Offshore wind is well established in the U.K. and some other countries but is just beginning to ramp up off America’s coasts, and this is the nation’s first foray into floating wind turbines. Auctions so far have been for those anchored to the seafloor.

Europe has some floating offshore wind — a project in the North Sea has been operating since 2017 — but the potential for the technology is huge in areas of strong wind off America’s coasts, said Josh Kaplowitz, vice president of offshore wind at the American Clean Power Association.

“We know that this works. We know that this can provide a huge slice of our our electricity needs, and if we’re going to solve the climate crisis we need to put as many clean electrons online as we can, particularly given increases in load demand with electric vehicles,” he said. “We can reach our greenhouse gas goals only with offshore wind as part of the puzzle.”

Similar auctions are in the works off Oregon’s coast next year and in the Gulf of Maine in 2024. President Joe Biden set a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 using traditional technology that secures wind turbines to the ocean floor, enough to power 10 million homes. Then the administration announced plans in September to develop floating platforms that could vastly expand offshore wind in the United States.

Minimum bids for the leases range from $6 million to $8 million, but sales could go higher. An auction earlier this year for traditional offshore wind leases off the coasts of New York and New Jersey netted more than $4 billion, the record for the U.S. so far.

The nation’s first offshore wind farm opened off the coast of Rhode Island in late 2016, allowing residents of small Block Island to shut off five diesel generators. Wind advocates took notice, but with five turbines, it’s not commercial scale.

The sale is designed to promote a domestic supply chain and create union jobs. Bidders can convert part of their bids into credits that benefit those affected by the wind development — local communities, tribes and commercial fishermen.

As envisioned, the turbines — possibly nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower — will float on giant triangular platforms roughly the size of a small city block with cables anchoring them underwater. They’ll each have three blades longer than the distance from home plate to the outfield on a baseball diamond, and will need to be assembled onshore and towed, upright, to their open-ocean destination.

Modern tall turbines, whether on or offshore, can produce more than 20 times more electricity than shorter machines, say, from the early 1990s.

As for visibility, “in absolutely perfect conditions, crystal clear on the best days, at the highest point, you might be able to see small dots on the horizon,” said Larry Oetker, executive director of the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Conservation and Recreation District, which has been preparing its deep-water port for the projects.

Offshore wind is a good complement to solar energy, which shuts down at night. Winds far out to sea are stronger and more sustained and also pick up in the evening, just when solar is going offline yet demand is high, said Jim Berger, a partner at the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright who specializes in financing renewable energy projects.

California has a 2045 goal of carbon neutrality. But “when the sun goes down we’re relying more on fossil fuel generation,” Berger said. “These projects are huge so when you add a project or a couple projects, you’re adding significantly to the power generation base in the state,” he said.

The lease areas have the potential to generate 4.5 gigawatts of energy -- enough for 1.5 million homes — and could bring big changes to communities in the rural coastal regions nearest the leases.

In remote Humboldt County, in northern California, the offshore projects are expected to generate more than 4,000 thousand jobs and $38 million in state and local tax revenue in an area that’s been economically depressed ever since the decline of the timber industry in the 1970s and 1980s, according to the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Conservation and Recreation District.

The district already received $12 million from California to prepare its deep-water port for the potential assembly of the massive turbines, which are too tall to fit under most bridges as they are towed out to sea, said Oetker, the district’s executive director.

“We have hundreds of acres of vacant, underutilized industrial property right on the existing navigation channel ... and there’s no overhead bridges or power lines or anything,” he said.

But some are also wary of the projects, despite favoring a transition to clean energy.

Environmentalists are concerned about the impacts on threatened and endangered whales, which could become entangled in the cables that will anchor the turbines. There are also concerns about birds and bats colliding with the turbine blades and whales getting struck by vessels towing components to the site. Federal regulators have set a boating speed limit for the project of less than 12 mph to address that concern, said Kristen Hislop, senior director of the marine program at the Environmental Defense Center.

“Floating offshore wind is brand new and there’s only a couple projects in the world and we don’t know how that’s going to impact our coast,” she said.

Tribes in the vast coastal regions also worry about damage to their ancestral lands from turbine assembly plants and transmission infrastructure. They fear that the farms will be visible on clear days from sacred prayer spots high in the mountains.

Frankie Myers, vice chairman of the Yurok Tribe, has attended four wind developer conferences in the past year. Tribes worked with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is overseeing the leasing process, to secure a 5% bid credit for tribal communities for the first time, he said. The agency also helped with a cultural assessment of the potential impact on views from sacred prayer spots, he said.

The tribes are so engaged now, early on, because they are used to outside industries coming to them with promises that aren’t fulfilled. They’ve seen things done wrong, and knowing this windswept area intimately, they want this to be done right, he said.

“Before they even showed us the map, before they even showed us all of their breakdowns ... we were like, ’We know exactly where it’s going,’” Myers said. “There’s no question where the best wind comes from, we all understand that. We’ve been here for a couple of thousand years.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/sale-jumpstarts-floating-offshore-wind-power-us-waters-rcna60230,2022-12-05T21:41:19.998000+00:00
298,Construction begins on the world's largest radio telescope,"Work is finally underway on the world’s largest radio astronomy observatory.

Known as the Square Kilometre Array, the mega telescope consists of huge clusters of dishes and antennas spread across remote parts of South Africa and Western Australia. Construction of the observatory began Monday after three decades of planning.

The Square Kilometre Array has been called one of the biggest scientific projects of the 21st century. The ultra-sensitive instrument will be used to probe some of the most baffling cosmic mysteries, ranging from dark matter, dark energy and how galaxies were formed to the origin of short but intense pulses of radio emissions known as fast radio bursts.

Catherine Cesarsky, chair of the Square Kilometre Array board of directors, said the observatory has been “many years in the making.”

“Today, we gather here to mark another important chapter in this 30-year journey that we’ve been on together. A journey to deliver the world’s largest scientific instrument,” she said in a statement.

The observatory is made up of two arrays: the SKA-Low in Western Australia, located on traditional lands of the Wajarri people, and the SKA-Mid, built in Karoo in the Northern Cape of South Africa.

The facility in Australia will be made up of more than 131,000 tree-shaped antennas each standing about 6.5 feet tall. Together they will be sensitive enough to pick up some of the faintest signals in the universe — low-frequency radio waves between 50 megahertz and 350 megahertz.

Compared to similar telescopes that exist now, the SKA-Low will be eight times more sensitive, have 25% better resolution and be able to survey the sky 135 times faster, according to the project’s scientists.

The South African component will consist of nearly 200 dishes, expanded from the 64-dish MeerKAT telescope that already exists on the site. These will be capable of operating in the mid-frequency range, from 350 megahertz to 15.4 gigahertz.

Compared to existing telescopes, the SKA-Mid in South Africa will operate with four times the resolution and five times the sensitivity and will be able to survey the sky 60 times faster, according to the project’s scientists.

Construction of the roughly $2 billion observatory is expected to continue through 2028, though parts of the arrays could be operational as early as 2024.",https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/construction-begins-worlds-largest-radio-telescope-rcna60110,2022-12-05T19:36:51.903000+00:00
299,Hawaii locals fear the impact of the Mauna Loa eruption as lava oozes closer to a main highway,"Lava flows from the eruption of Hawaii's Mauna Loa, the world's largest active volcano, are moving toward a main highway, adding to local worries on an island with few major roadways.

The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed in its most recent update, issued Thursday night local time, that the lava flows ""are traveling to the north toward the Daniel K. Inouye Highway (Saddle Road) but have reached relatively flatter ground and have slowed down significantly as expected.""

The highway connects the east and west sides of the Big Island, acting as a thoroughfare between the towns of Hilo and Kona.

The lava is traveling toward the highway at a rate of about 0.025 mph and, as of 1 p.m. local time Thursday, the flow front was about 3.2 miles from the highway, the agency's most recent update said.

That rate means the flow could reach the highway in about a week, but that timeline could change, according to the update, which notes that ""there are many variables at play and both the direction and timing of flow advance are fluid and are expected to change over periods of hours to days.""

A blockage of the road would pose problems, especially for those who use it to commute from Hilo and other parts of the island’s east side, where housing is generally more affordable, to jobs on the west side, home to many of the larger beach resorts. Hilo is also home to the Hilo Medical Center, which employs 1,600 people, some of whom come from the west side, NBC affiliate KHNL of Hawaii reported.

“We have such limited roadways on this island and any time we lose a roadway, it just shifts all that traffic to somewhere else,” Mike Brown, a Kona resident, told NBC News.

Unless some sort of bypass is constructed, commuters would need to take coastal routes to and from Kailua-Kona, adding at least an hour of extra driving each way.

Hawaii Gov. David Ige has issued an emergency proclamation to allow responders to arrive quickly or limit access as needed.

If lava does cross the highway, the Hawaii National Guard can help plan for alternatives and try to set up bypass routes, he said.

Hayley Hina Barcia, who lives in Hilo and has family in Kona, on the west side of the island, said her family relies on the highway to see one another.

“We’re looking to have to go several hours longer to go the south way or taking the north road.”

Sky Makai, a Hilo resident who works in Kona, said the highway blockage would make commuting to work “way harder.”

“I don’t know many people who have a four-hour commute, eight hours in a day,” he said. “So just trying to imagine that is pretty hard.”

Hawaii lava flows generally move slow enough to be avoidable, but they can be destructive, according to the USGS: “They can destroy everything in their paths, including vegetation and infrastructure —which can cut off road access and utilities.”

Lava flows can also cause “severe burns, abrasions, and lacerations upon contact with unprotected or exposed skin” and impact air quality by giving rise to hot temperatures and limited visibility after heavy rain, it states.

Mauna Loa, which means “long mountain,” covers half the island, according to the agency.

In about half of the previous eruptions, the lava remained in the summit region, which rises about 55,700 feet above its base. In the other cases, the lava spilled over into one of the rift zones, producing flows that covered broad swaths of the volcano’s lower slopes.

Before Sunday, geologists had recorded 33 eruptions since 1843, making Mauna Loa among the world’s most active volcanoes. It is one of six volcanoes in Hawaii, according to the USGS.

When the volcano last erupted in 1984, a fast-moving river of lava came within 2 miles of Kulani Prison before it stalled, according to the National Park Service.

A few days later, another lava flow that had moved 16 miles in just four days reached the outskirts of Hilo before stopping, sparing the city, the agency reported.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hawaii-locals-fear-impacts-mauna-loa-eruption-lava-oozes-closer-main-h-rcna59763,2022-12-02T14:02:14.543000+00:00
300,"Argentine Vice President Cristina Fernández convicted, sentenced in $1B fraud case","BUENOS AIRES, Argentina— Argentine Vice President Cristina Fernández was convicted and sentenced Tuesday to six years in prison and a lifetime ban from holding public office for a fraud scheme that embezzled $1 billion through public works projects during her presidency.

A three-judge panel found the Peronist leader guilty of fraud, but rejected a charge of running a criminal organization, for which the sentence could have been 12 years in prison. It was the first time an Argentine vice president has been convicted of a crime while in office.

Fernández lashed out at the verdict, describing herself as the victim of a “judicial mafia.” But she also later announced that she would not run next year for the presidency, a post she previously held in 2007-2015.

The sentence isn’t firm until appeals are decided, a process that could take years. She will remains immune from arrest meanwhile.

Fernández’s supporters vowed to paralyze the country with a nationwide strike. They clogged downtown Buenos Aires and marched on the federal court building, beating drums and shouting as they pressed against police barriers.

Fernández roundly denied all the accusations. Argentina’s dominant leader this century, she was accused of improperly granting public works contracts to a construction magnate closely tied to her family.

The verdict is certain to deepen fissures in the South American nation, where politics can be a blood sport and the 69-year-old populist leader is either loved or hated.

President Alberto Fernández, who is not related to his vice president, said on Twitter that she was innocent and that her conviction is “the result of a trial in which the minimum forms of due process were not taken care of.”

Prosecutors said Fernández fraudulently directed 51 public works projects to Lázaro Báez, a construction magnate and early ally of her and her husband Nestor Kirchner, who served as president in 2003-2007 and died suddenly in 2010.

Báez and members of Fernández’s 2007-2015 presidential administration were among a dozen others accused in the conspiracy. The panel also sentenced Báez and her public works secretary, José López, to six years. Most of the others got lesser sentences.

Prosecutors Diego Luciani and Sergio Mola said the Báez company was created to embezzle revenues through improperly bid projects that suffered from cost overruns and in many cases were never completed. The company disappeared after the Kirchners’ 12 years in power, they said.

In Argentina, judges in such cases customarily pronounce verdicts and sentences first and explain how they reached their decision later. The panel’s full decision is expected in February. After that, the verdict can be appealed up to the Supreme Court, a process that could take years.

Fernández went on her YouTube channel to say she will not seek further office after her vice presidential term expires on Dec. 10, 2023. “I’m not going to be a candidate for anything, not president, not for senator. My name is not going to be on any ballot. I finish on December 10 and go home,” she said.

Politicians and analysts had noted that until her appeal is settled, Fernández would be free to run for any elected office — from a seat in Congress to the presidency — and obtain immunity arrest by being elected.

“Cristina always surprises,” pollster Roberto Bacman, director of Argentina’s Center for Public Opinion Studies, said of her announcement. But “she will continue fighting,” he added. “She places herself in the center of the fight and says that she is not going to hide.”

He said it remains to be seen if the Peronist sector seeks to push Fernández to reconsider her decision.

Patricio Giusto, director of the consulting firm Diagnóstico Político, predicted Fernández will deepen her “strategy of victimization and equating herself” with Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva, the leftist politician who has just been elected president of Brazil after a court overturned his prison sentence for corruption.

During the judicial process, the vice president called herself a victim of “lawfare” and characterized the Judiciary as a pawn of the opposition media and conservative politician Mauricio Macri, who succeeded her as president in 2015-2019.

Fernández remains the singular leader of the leftist faction of the Peronist movement. Bacman said his surveys show 62% of Argentines want her removed and 38% support her no matter what.

Meanwhile, other cases remain pending against her, including a charge of money-laundering that also involves her son and daughter.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/argentine-president-cristina-fernandez-convicted-sentenced-1b-fraud-ca-rcna60472,2022-12-07T03:59:17.806000+00:00
301,Lula’s promise to create a ministry of Indigenous affairs in doubt,"BRASILIA — Brazil’s Indigenous leaders were disappointed on Monday after President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva appeared to backtrack on a promise to create a ministry of Indigenous affairs to help restore rights and protections that were undermined by the current government.

Lula said on Friday he might instead decide on a special department linked to the presidential office rather than a fully-fledged ministry, which disappointed Indigenous leaders who were taken by surprise by his comments.

“It was a campaign promise by Lula and we are still working on building a Ministry of the First people,” said Dinamam Tuxá, a lawyer for the largest Indigenous umbrella group, the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB).

Sonia Guajajara, APIB leader who in October became only the third Indigenous person ever elected to Congress, said a working group in Lula’s transition team will present a proposal for the ministry next week, but she does not expect any announcement until after the day he takes office on Jan. 1.

The ministry was important for the historical recognition of Brazil’s 900,000 indigenous people and reparation for their mistreatment and loss of land rights, she told Reuters.

Lula drew loud applause at the COP27 climate talks in Egypt last month when he told delegates he explicitly promised an Indigenous ministry to ensure “dignified survival, security, peace and sustainability” for some 300 Indigenous tribes that still exist in Brazil.

Under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, whom Lula defeated narrowly on Oct. 30, violence has increased against Indigenous communities who lands have been increasingly invaded by illegal gold miners, loggers and cattle ranchers.

“The recognition of land claims that have been paralyzed under Bolsonaro must be restarted and urgent action is needed to protect Indigenous people, as well as environmentalists and defenders of our rights who are at risk,” Guajajara said.

Bolsonaro eased environmental enforcement and backed legislation to allow commercial agriculture and mining in the Amazon, and even on protected Indigenous reservation land, measures that the APIB is now seeking to revert.

Guajajara said violence by organized crime had surged in frontier areas, such as the Javari Valley bordering Peru where British journalist Don Phillips and Bruno Pereira, an expert in isolated tribes, were murdered by illegal fishermen in June.

Indigenous experts said the creation of a secretariat directly under the wing of the presidency could be faster to set up, more effective and cost less.

But Indigenous leaders said a ministry was needed to support their communities with the power to mobilize other ministries, and even the police and security forces to protect them.

“Our situation is so serious today that we need a robust ministry with powers and resources to defend us,” said Eliesio Marubo, lawyer for the Javari Valley Indigenous union Univaja.

A main Indigenous demand is to revamp the government’s Indigenous Affairs Agency Funai, which has been run by a policeman appointed by Bolsonaro and seen by the people it is meant to protect as a tool of the farm sector’s land interests.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lulas-promise-create-ministry-indigenous-affairs-doubt-rcna60311,2022-12-06T15:45:21.796000+00:00
302,LULAC sues Houston over lack of Latino representation on the City Council,"The nation’s oldest Latino civil rights organization accused the city of Houston in a federal lawsuit of denying Latinos fair representation by allowing voters citywide to elect five council members.

The lawsuit filed Monday by the League of United Latin American Citizens alleges the use of at-large districts — where all voters across the city can vote for the candidates, instead of voters within a specific district — violates the Voting Rights Act. Elections in the city are deeply, racially polarized and Latinos' voting strength is diluted through the at-large election process, the lawsuit states.

""Houston's the only major city in Texas where five council members are elected at large and in essence, disenfranchising the Latino community,"" Domingo Garcia, LULAC president, said in a phone interview. ""All the other major cities, Austin, El Paso, Fort Worth, Dallas, have all single member districts and have Latino representation that's reflective of their diversity. Houston only has one Latino on City Council.""

The city has elected only two Hispanics through its at-large districts in its history, LULAC said in its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas in Houston.

Houston is 44.5% Latino. It is Texas’ most populous city and the nation’s fourth most populous. The council controls a $5.7 billion budget, LULAC noted.

Houston officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

The suit was filed on behalf of four registered voters from Houston — Cristina Acosta, Ivan Castillo, Anthony Rios and Ivan Sanchez — and also lists LULAC as a plaintiff.

The lawsuit notes that in 1979, Houston’s City Council went from almost all white male to a more diverse body after voters elected the first two women and first Mexican American to the council and tripled the number of Black council members.

Since then, only 11 Latinos have been elected or appointed to a single member district and only two have been elected to an at-large district, according to the LULAC lawsuit.

The lawsuit also challenges new boundaries drawn for single-member districts in the city's redistricting process.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lulac-sues-houston-lack-latino-representation-city-council-rcna60177,2022-12-05T22:01:23.790000+00:00
303,DCCC upped spending on Latino voters.Was it enough?,"In the first week of October, Democrats got a jolt when a South Texas district they had expected to win easily began to appear less of a certainty.

A week after the nonpartisan Cook Political Report changed its rating of the state's 34th Congressional District from ""lean Democrat"" to ""toss-up,"" TV ads paid for by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) began airing in English and Spanish. They criticized Republican Rep. Mayra Flores as an extremist who backs Texas’ anti-abortion law and who “sided with the mob when they stormed the Capitol.”

This was no last-minute ad, but what the DCCC, the House Democrats' political arm, said was part of an aggressive, well-funded campaign to engage Latino voters this election cycle.

Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez won the race, defeating Flores by about 8.5 percentage points in the district, where about 86 percent of registered voters are Latino. Gonzalez did his own spending and campaigning, but amid an onslaught of Republican spending in the region’s elections, the DCCC ads were welcome, Gonzalez’s campaign said.

“We did historic investments when it came to Latino voters and voters of color,” said Maríafernanda Zacarías, DCCC senior adviser for Latino engagement. “We were on the ground organizing for over a year and a half before November of this year … and it grew from already having those relationships on the ground to paid media.”

Latinos voted overwhelmingly for Latino and Latina candidates in the midterms, the DCCC said in a memo provided first to NBC News.

The memo said that the Latino support that the DCCC helped harness, contradicted two years of forecasting from pundits, media figures and some Democratic strategists that there would be an exodus of Latino support for Democrats this cycle. The narrative was driven, in part, by the gains former President Donald Trump made with Latinos in the 2020 election cycle.

In the recent midterm elections, Republicans won control of the House, winning 222 seats to Democrats’ 213, with two races not yet called by NBC News.

But some Hispanic Democrats found success in key races that Republicans had hoped to win.

In its memo, the DCCC touted wins by at least eight Hispanic Democratic candidates in House battlefield districts, including Reps. Mike Levin in California, Teresa Leger Fernandez in New Mexico, Gonzalez and Henry Cuellar in Texas as well as Reps-elect Andrea Salinas in Oregon, Yadira Caraveo in Colorado and Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez.

“Latino electorate-heavy districts from Virginia to Texas to Nevada turned out in support of Democrats,” the DCCC stated.

Not only was there not a significant decrease in Latino support for Democrats, the DCCC said, there were slight increases in Democratic support in some districts, such as those of Leger Fernandez, Cuellar and in Arizona’s 4th Congressional District, where about 19% of eligible voters are Hispanic.

The memo notes the DCCC spent $18 million on independent expenditures — money for TV and digital ads and other forms of communication that is not coordinated with the campaign — to target Latinos in races across the country. The spending was double the independent expenditure spending on Hispanics in 2020, the DCCC said.

That spending is in addition to $30 million that the committee set aside this election cycle for its Build Our Base program, aimed at reinforcing and growing support among voters of color.

Gonzalez in South Texas was one of the beneficiaries of the spending. The DCCC spent $1.15 million on English language ads and about $126,058 million on Spanish language ads, according to AdImpact data.

That Latino spending was just one portion of the big-money ultimately unsuccessful effort to hold the House Democratic majority.

In total, the DCCC spent about $100.4 million on TV, radio and digital advertising this past election cycle, according to data from the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. About $4.6 million of that was on Spanish-language advertising. And hundreds of millions more were spent by Democratic and Republican campaigns, as well as their affiliated outside groups.

A call for longer-term, deeper investment

Democratic strategist Matt Angle agreed with the DCCC that Republicans fell short of the rhetoric and stated goals in wooing Latino voters. Democrats invested in holding their Latino support and “mostly succeeded,” said Angle, who runs the Lone Star Project supporting Texas Democrats.

But he said the DCCC memo reflects “an almost entirely defensive strategy based on not losing ground with Latinos, rather than broadening and deepening support for Democrats beyond districts already held or drawn to be held by Democrats.”

Angle said more and earlier investment would have helped assure candidates in competitive districts and undermined structural progress Republicans had made developing local Latino leaders who will help them long term.

“Democrats will continue to be on the defensive without a longer term investment to create political structure that exists beyond individual campaigns,” he said.

Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha, a frequent critic of Democrats on investment in Latino voters and hiring of Latino consultants, said there’s no denying Latino voters “helped make history in the midterms.”

“But there is also no denying that if we want to win back control of Congress in 2024, we will need to win Latino-heavy congressional districts we lost in 2022 midterms,"" Rocha said, like Congressional District 27 in Florida, where Annette Taddeo lost to Republican Maria Elvira Salazar, or the 15th District in Texas, where Monica de la Cruz defeated Michelle Vallejo in a district redrawn to give Republicans the edge.

Rocha also named races in California (Districts 22, 27 and 13), all districts where President Joe Biden would have beaten Donald Trump by 10 or more points, if they had been on the ballot, according to the Cook Political Report.

The DCCC spent about $4.7 million in English language ads and about $13.9 million on Spanish language ads in California's 22nd Congressional District race where Republican David Valadao defeated Rudy Salas.

In California's 13th Congressional District, in California's Central Valley, the DCCC spent $2.7 million on English language ads and $415,841 on Spanish language ads, according to AdImpact. The race has yet to be called by NBC News.

Republican Rep. Mike Garcia defeated Democrat Christy Smith to return to Congress for California’s 27th Congressional District, based in northern Los Angeles. Democrats had a registration advantage in the district. Records show no DCCC spending in the district.

There were complaints during the election when Democratic committees and leaders pulled funding from the 15th Congressional District race in Texas, deciding Democrat Vallejo's polling was not showing she could win in a district drawn to favor Republicans.

The DCCC spent $147,935 in English language ads and $61,150 in Spanish language ads in that district, data shows. It also opened a headquarters for the district in spring, had staff on the ground after the primary and included Vallejo in its Red to Blue program that provides candidates resources for their campaigns.

304,The Justis Connection wants to make Black attorneys more accessible to Black clients,"Cassaundra Brownell, a self-described “serial entrepreneur” from Maryland, was relieved when she found the Justis Connection, a company that links potential clients with Black attorneys. After failing to see results with an attorney she hired to help her launch an architecture firm she purchased in May, Brownell felt a Black attorney would be a better option.

It seemed “like we had to prove something to him,” she said of her first lawyer. Brownell said she felt that he pushed aside her needs, responded slowly and even expressed a lack of confidence in the new business. “So, we had to make a change. We were looking for someone where our needs could be met, versus feeling like we had to build credibility with the attorney first.”

Brownell learned of Kisha A. Brown’s Justis Connection on LinkedIn and immediately contacted Brown, who then connected her to multiple Black lawyers in her area. She eventually hired Kerry Davidson, a Black attorney who graduated from Harvard Law School and has served her firm well, Brownell said, providing “first-rate service” in a timely manner.

Her case illuminates a point Black lawyers and advocates have been making for some time: Black clients feel that they receive heightened support and more favorable results from Black lawyers than with non-Black legal aid. And unlike Black lawyer associations like the National Conference of Black Lawyers and The National Black Lawyers, which some have relied on to find Black legal representatives in their cities, the Justis Connection specifically works on making those client-attorney connections. Advocates say this is important, adding that more Black lawyer representation in the legal field can be compared to studies that suggest Black patients with Black doctors receive more competent care.

“For us, having a Black attorney is such a bonus because he relates to us. They have gone through some of the same challenges that we go through as a Black entrepreneur,” Brownell said. “With a Black lawyer, you start with credibility; you don’t have to build it with them. They understand you. There’s a greater sense of urgency in responding to your needs.”

According to the 2022 American Bar Association National Lawyer Population Survey, only 4.5% of lawyers are Black, with 81% white. Additionally, only 5.4% of public defenders are Black, according to an estimate from Zippia, a jobs and career website. With Black people disproportionately incarcerated compared to other races — 38% of people in prison or jail are Black, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, although Black people make up only 13.6% of the U.S. population — the chances are low that they’ll be able to find a Black attorney to handle their case.

These startling numbers were a major factor for Brown, a labor and employee relations attorney, to launch the Justis Connection in 2021. The service is available in Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C., and will expand later this month to Atlanta, Chicago and Orlando, Florida. Next year, the company aims to set up networks in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Texas. Brown also has plans for California and other parts of the country.

“I felt the need for this from the minute I started law school,” Brown, a Georgetown Law graduate, said. “I had people asking, ‘Hey, do you know somebody who does family law? Do you know somebody that does criminal law?’ And on and on. And then you sort of go through your phone, and you start emailing folks because you want to make that connection. And that’s something most Black people experience because we don’t have Black lawyers in our inner circle.”

There are about 30 attorneys in the Washington, D.C., area in Brown’s directory so far, with skills ranging from family law, criminal law and estate planning to tax and business law.

“It shouldn’t have to be this way, but it is,” Brown said. “So, aligning Black people with Black lawyers is the right thing to do, not only for that person, but also for the system because when we challenge the system and the wrongdoing that occurs to us, the system shifts.”

Davidson, whom Brownell hired through the Justis Connection network, said it is important for Black people to seek help from an attorney early in the process instead of as a last resort.

“And the thing about a Black attorney is that he or she would be much more relatable to Black clients,” Davidson said. “The Black attorney will understand exactly some of the hardships that they’re facing because the attorneys themselves have seen it in either his own family or personally or with people he’s close to. There’s a personal connection.”

That personal connection is what clients who want Black representation hope will result in a deeper commitment, which they believe can lead to favorable results.

“It can be much more difficult for white attorneys to understand that the motivation for some of the things that happen to a Black client would be predominantly racial and motivated by animus,” Davidson said. “It’s not their experience. So, he would say, ‘Why would people be doing all this horrible stuff to you? I don’t want to investigate this case, because there’s no way you could have enough evidence to prove that people are doing this.’”

Davidson said he proved an employment discrimination case where “the employer put the Black people in one building and the white people in another building and treated the two groups completely differently. It’s extremely hard for a white attorney to believe that could happen in this day and age. So, he wouldn’t want or believe in the case.”

Anu B. Kemet, another attorney in Maryland who is in the Justis Connection network, said the sensitivity Black people have for each other because of shared experiences makes working together a natural fit — and makes Brown’s networking company viable.

“We care more about one another,” Kemet said. “My whole life experience has been nothing but people who look like me always looking out for me. I went to Morehouse College as an undergrad. I went to Vanderbilt Law School and divinity school. No Vanderbilt graduate has ever helped me or looked out for me. Black people understand more about the issues that we face, particularly in the family law and criminal law sphere that are uniquely our issues.”

Kemet joked that the experience of having a Black attorney working for you is like having a Black DJ spin music at a club: “Would you want to go to a Black club with a white DJ? You can, and you might have a good time. But it’s probably not going to be the same.”

However, even with connections being made, a significant problem still exists: There are not enough Black attorneys to address the needs of Black clients. Kemet, who has been a partner in his boutique firm, the Kemet Hunt Law Group, for 20 years, said that deficiency is disheartening.

“The endemic and systemic choking of Black opportunity within this field is very complex,” he said. “The first thing is the schools themselves are designed to promote a particular body of people and not another body. It’s the history of this country. My law partner and I have been together for 20 years, which makes us one of the longest-lasting partnerships for a Black firm.”

For that reason, Brown said, the Justis Connection is hoping to be a pathway for changing the status quo for clients seeking Black representation.

“It’s really inspiring the work that Black lawyers do because we’re connected to our community’s success in a really personal way,” Brown said. “‘You look like my cousin.’ ‘You went to school with my niece.’ ‘We’re in the same fraternity.’ ‘We go to the same church.’ ‘I’m from that area, too.’ There are all these different intersections that we have. And so, there’s this natural connection that most Black lawyers have that inspire our ethical obligation to zealously advocate for our client, no matter who they are, what they look like.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/justis-connection-wants-make-black-attorneys-accessible-black-clients-rcna60353,2022-12-07T04:28:22.733000+00:00
305,Ava DuVernay becomes the first Black woman featured on Ben & Jerry's pint,"Ava DuVernay has become the first Black woman to have her image on a Ben & Jerry’s pint.

The ubiquitous ice cream company on Tuesday announced the release of “Lights! Caramel! Action! directed by Ava DuVernay,” which will feature a mix of vanilla ice cream with salted caramel swirls, graham cracker swirls and gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough. DuVernay personally curated the flavor creation, which will be available in both milk-based and non-dairy versions. Pints will begin shipping across the country in January 2023.

“Ice cream is a simple joy of life. A comfort food that I’ve turned to on many days — making sunny ones brighter and dark ones sweeter,” DuVernay said in a statement. “Partnering with Ben & Jerry’s, a company that I’ve long admired for their commitment to social justice, has been a thrill ride. I had the opportunity to work with food scientists to create a flavor with all the ingredients that I personally love for a cause close to my heart. Beyond being downright delicious, proceeds from further its non-profit mission of inclusion and belonging in the film and TV industries. A worthy and delicious endeavor.”

Proceeds from the new flavor will benefit the DuVernay’s non-profit Array Alliance, which the director founded in 2011 with the mission is to amplify the work of artists of color and women directors. For this reason, the partnership is not a limited-edition run but will be a continual release.

“Framing this up as a new flavor for the first Black woman to be a featured partner on our pints doesn’t do Ava justice,” Matthew McCarthy, Ben & Jerry’s CEO, said in a statement. “We are humbled by this partnership, impressed by her work sharing not only the struggle but the joy in the justice, and we are inspired by her commitment and vision.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/ava-duvernay-becomes-first-black-woman-featured-ben-jerrys-pint-rcna60361,2022-12-06T18:09:27.600000+00:00
306,Advocates say increasing Black teachers should be a national concern,"Ashley Reeves, an Indiana school teacher, dreamed of getting her teaching license but could not afford the high price of certification. She settled for a renewable teaching permit, which allows educators to work for one year, to teach at George and Veronica Phalen Leadership Academy, a kindergarten through eighth grade school in Indianapolis. However, Reeves’ aspirations were revitalized when she saw a flier for the Educate ME Foundation, an organization focused on helping Black people become teachers.

Reeves said she joined the program in August and got one-on-one support for test preparation and financial help to cover the costs of certification tests. Reeves received her license in November and returned to the classroom a certified teacher.

“It was like a relief. It was a blessing. It’s always been one of my goals,” Reeves, 31, said. “I’ve been in education for quite some time; it’s been six years. The program itself is just great for first-time teachers or teachers who’ve been in education for a long time.”

Blake Nathan launched the Educate ME Foundation in 2014 in Indianapolis to recruit and retain more Black teachers. Today, the foundation works to mentor and support high school and college students looking to pursue careers in education. It teaches Black students about the value of becoming teachers and helps existing teachers through training and certification programs. Reeves is one of dozens of Black people who have used the foundation’s programs to reach their career goals. Nathan said the work they do ultimately benefits students.

“If you are being educated by a same-race teacher, academically, emotionally, you perform better in the classroom,” Nathan said. “Having a Black teacher in the school building decreases school discipline rates. And if you can decrease school discipline rates, you can decrease the school-to-prison pipeline.”

Before Covid changed the education landscape, Black students were already at a disadvantage due to the dismal number of Black teachers in the classroom and other effects of systemic racism. Black people represented just 7% of teachers in the 2017-18 school year, with white teachers making up 79% of the field, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics. This is a dire situation as research shows that when Black students have teachers who look like them, they’re less likely to be over-disciplined and more likely to finish high school and consider college. Therefore, experts say, hiring Black teachers is necessary to address the racial disparities that lead to poor educational outcomes and criminalization for Black children.

But there are many barriers to Black people entering the teaching field. Costly certification tests and exams, called Praxis tests, are a major roadblock for Black teachers trying to become certified, as Black people are more likely than whites to fail these tests, according to a Chalkbeat report. Meanwhile, for Black people who are able to enter the profession, failing these tests can get them booted from their teaching jobs.

Critics believe that these tests, first implemented decades ago, simply work to exclude Black teachers and don’t adequately measure a person’s teaching ability. And there’s little evidence that these tests predict teacher effectiveness at all. And research has shown that, in some cases, Black students perform better academically with a Black teacher who failed the Praxis exam than with a white teacher who passed.

Furthermore, advocates say that Black students who don’t have Black teachers are less likely to become teachers themselves, so commitments to diversifying the industry must start early on in the classroom.

The Educate Me Foundation is one of many programs across the country that aim to train and recruit more Black people into the teaching profession. The programs may use different methods, with some focusing on breaking down the field’s financial barriers and others prioritizing the need to remove implicit biases in credentialing processes (or promoting cultural inclusivity in schools). But they all ultimately aim to improve the educational experience for Black children.

Call Me MISTER, a Clemson University development program for Black men to become elementary school teachers, has produced some 367 educators since 2004, said program field coordinator Winston Holton. Participants are required to work at a South Carolina K-12 public school between one and four years after completing the program, which usually lasts four years, Holton said. Students from “socioeconomically disadvantaged and educationally at-risk communities” receive tuition assistance, mentorship and support for navigating the education industry, and help with job placement.

Founder Tom Parks decided to launch the program in 2000 after learning about the troubling incarceration rates and dismal educational opportunities for Black men. Holton joined the program in 2001 and now serves as a mentor to participants like Caleb Brown, a 20-year-old in his third year of the program, who hopes to become a middle school teacher.

“Representation in the classroom is important,” Brown said. “In the sense of the level of relationships and connections I’ve made, getting this experience early on, that wouldn’t have been possible without the help of Call Me MISTER.”

Many of these development and recruitment programs cater to all genders, but some — like Call Me MISTER and Men of CHS Teach, a Charleston, South Carolina, program inspired by Call Me MISTER — focus on producing more Black male teachers. Just 2% of the country’s teachers are Black men.

That startling statistic, advocates say, is why programs offering different pathways to certification are important.

“Minority males face a lot of barriers in their K-12 experience,” said Eric Stallings, who works with Men of CHS Teach to recruit and support teachers. Men of CHS Teach, which prioritizes men of color, is a partnership between the University of South Carolina and the Charleston County School District.

“They may go into business or marketing, but something always tugs at your heart and you say, ‘I’ve always wanted to be a teacher. I just don’t know,’” he said. “Us creating pathways for that to happen has allowed some of them to come back as educators and truly make a difference. I think that speaks a lot about alternative certification.”

Sharif El-Mekki, founder and CEO of the Center for Black Educator Development based in Philadelphia, said the center’s mission is to build a “national Black teacher pipeline” through policy and advocacy efforts, programs, and partnering with school districts, colleges and similar programs across the country. The center works with school districts to facilitate a course for high school students interested in teaching “but from a Black pedagogical framework, as opposed to what students typically get, all-white educational theory,” El-Mekki said.

“If you try to pursue and reform education without having a deep understanding of the racism that exists to create these disparities, you’re never going to achieve what you purport you want to achieve,” he said.

The center also provides training and mentorship programs for high school and college students, professional development for everyone from college professors to administrators, and consultation services for school districts across the country looking to retain Black teachers. Since its founding in 2019, the center has produced at least 30 teachers, who are now educators or in teacher residency programs.

While some groups focus on getting more Black teachers into classrooms, others focus on the cultural inclusivity that they believe is necessary for tearing down implicit bias in schools — whether in the classroom or the administration offices. The Black Teacher Project in Oakland, California, works with Black teachers to “reimagine schools as communities of liberated learning,” the Project’s website reads. The project offers an 18-month fellowship for Black teachers where they explore Black identity, wellness and culturally competent teaching (or “instruction rooted in Blackness,” according to the site). It also teaches educators how to implement restorative practices in their classrooms and invites them to retreats to foster community among Black teachers.

This, advocates say, will have a positive impact on Black students.

“BTP’s vision is that every student will benefit from the diversity, excellence, and leadership of an empowered Black teaching force,” the website states. “Therefore, the Black Teacher Project’s motto is ‘Every child deserves a Black teacher.’”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/advocates-say-increasing-black-teachers-national-concern-rcna59814,2022-12-05T19:41:14.957000+00:00
307,Same-sex couples wary despite federal marriage rights bill,"Mary and Sharon Bishop-Baldwin were jubilant after winning a decadelong fight for the right to wed in Oklahoma.

But eight years after tying the knot — on the day they won their lawsuit challenging a state ban on gay marriage — and seven years after the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed same-sex couples’ constitutional right to marry, they no longer take their union for granted.

While they’re happy that Congress is moving swiftly to ensure nationwide recognition of same-sex and interracial marriages, they — like many in LGBTQ communities — are frustrated it’s even necessary after so many years and are unsure whether it’s enough.

“The very fact we’re even having these conversations is really disheartening to me,” especially given a dramatic shift in public opinion over the past decade, with polls showing 70% of U.S. adults now favor same-sex marriage rights, said Sharon Bishop-Baldwin, 54.

But when the high court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed abortion rights, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested in a concurring opinion that the decision upholding gay marriage should also be reconsidered. That prompted Democrats to act quickly to protect same-sex marriage while the party still holds the majority in both chambers of Congress.

The Senate passed the Respect for Marriage Act last week with support from 12 Republicans; it’s expected to easily win approval in the House before being signed by President Joe Biden.

At first, Sharon Bishop-Baldwin said, she thought the act was “lip service.” But she changed her mind because it would at least provide some protection.

“It’s ridiculous to think that anybody in this country who has legally married one place could suddenly be unmarried in another,” Bishop-Baldwin said.

When the couple filed their 2004 Oklahoma lawsuit, 76% of state voters had just approved a constitutional ban on gay marriage. Ten years later, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a federal appeals court ruling that declared the state ban unconstitutional. A year later, the high court decided in another case that all states had to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.

“When we won, one of our lawyers said, ‘This is game, set, match, marriage’ ... and that’s what we thought: We’re done,” said Bishop-Baldwin, who runs a small newspaper and met her wife in 1995 when both were editors at the Tulsa World.

The legislation wouldn’t codify, or enshrine into law, the Supreme Court decision requiring states to issue same-sex marriage licenses. But if that decision were overturned and states revived bans, they still would have to recognize same-sex marriages performed legally in other states.

“I can’t imagine that happening at the Supreme Court ... but we have to be prepared,” said Mary Bishop-Baldwin, 61, who notes that Oklahoma’s ban is still on the books.

The possibility has created “a state of extreme anxiety and stress” among same-sex couples, said Jenny Pizer, chief legal officer at Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ civil rights group.

That’s especially true for those with children, she said. Currently, both spouses are considered legal parents, which is especially important if one of them dies or they divorce. “So this bill really does matter,” Pizer said.

Some also fear the high court or a future Congress could undo the federal legislation.

“Every time the House and Senate overturn, you’ll wonder what might happen this time,” said Dawn Betts-Green, 43, who lives in Birmingham, Alabama, with her wife, Anna Green, whom she married in Florida in 2016. “It’s honestly in the hands of whoever we elect, and that is scary.”

A scenario in which constitutional protections are overturned by the Supreme Court and the Respect for Marriage Act is overturned by the court or Congress might be a long shot, but “it is certainly possible for there to be a series of events that really took us back to that earlier time when it was incredibly difficult for families,” Pizer said.

“The idea of returning to those days, frankly, is terrifying,” she said.

Betts-Green and her wife hurried to complete paperwork, such as wills and powers of attorney, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, getting “all of our legal ducks in a row (because) they’re clearly coming for us,” she said, recalling a time when her wife was hospitalized in Florida — before they were married — and a nurse said Betts-Green would not be permitted to make medical decisions.

Marriage also provides many other legal protections, including the ability to claim survivor benefits from Social Security and to obtain health insurance through a spouse’s plan, and tax benefits, such as the ability to leave assets to a spouse.

The Respect for Marriage Act makes Betts-Green feel a little more secure, she said, though “I find it absolutely ridiculous that we’re having to go through this kind of thing in 2022, not only just for queer people, but also interracial marriages. It’s not 1941, but it certainly feels like we’ve gone back in time.”

The issue of same-sex marriage also is overshadowing other concerns, including anti-LGBTQ legislation and harassment of and attacks on LGBTQ people, most notably the recent shooting at a Colorado nightclub that killed five people, Betts-Green said.

“I’m constantly reminded that this is the least of our issues in a lot of ways,” she said.

Minneapolis legal aide Robbin Reed, a white woman who is married to a Black transgender man, supports the act but worries it could mean more danger from people who might be angered by its protections.

“The law won’t really change anything about my life ... because there’s still so much to worry about,” said Reed, who has an 8-month-old child and performs with her husband in queer nightclubs. “This is a ridiculous situation to be in.”

The Bishop-Baldwins said they doubt the Supreme Court will strip away same-sex marriage rights, but are relieved there will be some protections in place just in case. Still, federal legislation shouldn’t even be required, they say.

“Is the Respect for Marriage Act good enough? No, of course not. Good enough should be” constitutional protection, said Sharon Bishop-Baldwin.

Betts-Green said nothing would surprise her now: “You can never really be comfortable.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/-sex-couples-wary-federal-marriage-rights-bill-rcna60302,2022-12-06T15:05:44.656000+00:00
308,Supreme Court leans toward web designer over refusal to work on same-sex weddings,"WASHINGTON — Conservative Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared sympathetic toward an evangelical Christian web designer’s bid to avoid working on same-sex weddings as they weighed the latest clash between religious conservatives and LGBTQ rights.

But after two-and-a-half hours of arguments that included a broad array of tough hypothetical questions directed at both sides, involving far-fetched scenarios like a ""Black Santa"" at a shopping mall refusing to serve children dressed in Ku Klux Klan outfits, it is unclear how exactly the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, will rule.

Lorie Smith, who opposes same-sex marriage on religious grounds and runs a business in Colorado designing websites, is seeking an exemption from a state law that outlaws discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accommodations.

Smith sued the state in 2016 because she said she would like to accept customers planning opposite-sex weddings but reject requests made by same-sex couples wanting the same service. She argues that, as a creative professional, she has a free speech right under the Constitution’s First Amendment to refuse to undertake work that conflicts with her own views.

Civil rights groups say Smith is asking the conservative-majority court for a “license to discriminate” that would gut public accommodation laws that require businesses to serve all customers.

Justices in the conservative majority seemed generally supportive of the notion that Smith should not be forced to express sentiments to which she disagrees, with Justice Clarence Thomas noting that policing speech was not how public accommodations laws like Colorado's were traditionally applied.

""This is is not a hotel. This is not a restaurant. This is not a riverboat or a train,"" he said, referring to businesses required to service all customers. Other conservative justices, including Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, asked similar questions.

Lorie Smith, owner of 303 Creative, at her studio in Littleton, Colo., on Nov. 15. Rachel Woolf / The Washington Post via Getty Images

Kavanaugh asked whether a publishing house that supports abortion rights could refuse to publish a book containing anti-abortion views. Gorsuch queried whether freelance writers could be required to accept commissions expressing views they opposed.

Echoing Thomas, Gorsuch said the extension of public accommodations laws to speech was “very different than the historical understanding of public accommodation.”

But the problem facing the court if it rules for Smith is how to determine what kind of other conduct can be exempted from antidiscrimination laws. The court could try to limit the ruling to certain opponents of same-sex marriage, although the legal principle raised in the case extends to all kind of creative businesses that might invoke their free speech rights to reject all manner of customers.

Liberal justices, who seemed more aligned with the state of Colorado, came armed with tough questions on whether businesses could refuse to serve Black or disabled customers.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, for example, asked about a photographer who makes custom photos of nostalgic, sepia-toned mid-20th century scenes but restricts who can appear in the photographs.

""Precisely because they’re trying to capture the feelings of a certain era, their policy is that only white children can be photographed with Santa in this way because that’s how they view the scenes with Santa that they’re trying to depict,"" she said. Jackson asked Smith's lawyer, Kristen Waggoner, why that would be different to what her client is seeking.

Fellow liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor took a similar line in raising other scenarios in which people could reject requests from customers.

""How about people who don't believe in interracial marriage or about people who believe that disabled people shouldn't get married?"" Sotomayor asked.

In responding to those hypothetical situations, conservative Justice Samuel Alito brought up his own, wondering whether a ""Black Santa"" who sits for photos with children over the holiday season could refuse to provide service to children wearing the white outfits characteristic of the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group.

""Black Santa has to do that?"" Alito asked.

Eric Olson, Colorado's solicitor general, said the ""Black Santa"" would not have to be in the photograph because Ku Klux Klan outfits are not protected under Colorado's antidiscrimination law.

The case is a latest example of the conflict over the Supreme Court’s own 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, which conservative Christians oppose even as Congress has moved to enact a law with bipartisan support that bolsters protections for married same-sex couples.

Smith, whose business is called 303 Creative, told NBC News she has always been drawn to creative projects but also has strongly held beliefs that “marriage is between one man and one woman — and that union is significant.”

Smith sued the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and other state officials out of concern that she could be sanctioned under its antidiscrimination law that bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accommodations, although she has not been sanctioned yet. Lower courts ruled against Smith, prompting her to appeal to the Supreme Court.

The case gives the court a second bite at a legal question it considered but never resolved when it ruled in a similar case in 2018 in favor of a Christian baker, also from Colorado, who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. The court ruled then that the baker, Jack Phillips, did not receive a fair hearing before the state Civil Rights Commission because there was evidence of anti-religious bias.

The 2018 ruling left undecided the broader question now at issue in Smith’s case. If the court rules in favor of Smith, certain business owners would effectively have an exemption from elements of laws in 29 states that protect LGBTQ rights in public accommodations in some form. The remaining 21 states do not have laws explicitly protecting LGBTQ rights in public accommodations, although some local municipalities do.

Civil rights groups say that a ruling along those lines would undermine the entire purpose of antidiscrimination laws.

State officials have said in court papers that they never investigated Smith and had no evidence that anyone had ever asked her to create a website for a same-sex wedding. Colorado Solicitor General Eric Olson wrote that there is a long tradition of public accommodations laws protecting the ability of all people to obtain goods and services.

Smith, like Phillips before her, is represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group, which has had success arguing religious rights cases at the Supreme Court in recent years. The court ruled on the baker case before the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted in favor of LGBTQ rights in key cases. Now, following three appointments made by former President Donald Trump, the court has six conservative and three liberal justices.

Kennedy was in the majority when the court legalized gay marriage on a 5-4 vote. In another major victory for LGBTQ rights, the Supreme Court in 2020 ­— to the surprise of many court-watchers ­­— ruled that a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in employment protects LGBTQ employees.

A year later the court ruled in favor of an agency affiliated with the Catholic Church that the city of Philadelphia had barred from its foster care program because of the church’s opposition to same-sex marriage. In other cases in recent years the conservative majority has consistently backed religious rights.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-weighs-web-designers-refusal-work-sex-weddings-rcna59852,2022-12-05T21:33:46.538000+00:00
309,From 'Spoiler Alert' to 'The Whale': December's must-see queer content,"The final watchlist of 2022 has a little bit of everything, from returning series to moving documentaries and Christmas blockbusters making it before the Oscars submissions cutoff.

That means the beautiful people of New York City’s Constance Billard-St. Jude’s School and Toronto’s most deadpan nanny are back for the second seasons of “Gossip Girl” and “Sort Of.” And after making their way through the year’s film festivals, the cerebral but heartfelt documentaries “Framing Agnes” and “Nelly and Nadine” finally get to tell their forgotten histories to the world. Not long after, “Babylon” and “I Wanna Dance With Somebody,” with their giant budgets and all-star casts, open in theaters.

For more traditional holiday fare, audiences can catch a screening of the heartbreaking rom-com “Spoiler Alert” or enjoy Matt Rogers’ can’t-miss Showtime comedy special from home. Because what would the holidays be without laughter and tears? So break out the tissues, cuddle up on the couch or head to the theater, and enjoy the best of what December has to offer.

'Gossip Girl'

Season one of HBO’s “Gossip Girl” reboot revealed that, this time around, it was the embittered teachers of the newly renamed Constance Billard-St. Jude’s School sowing chaos in the halls of the prestigious high school. (Millennial habits die hard.) By the end of the season, the mastermind behind the newly inaugurated Gossip Girl Instagram account, Kate Keller (Tavi Gevinson), was spiraling out about the ethics of her quest to take down her privileged students, which somehow leads her to partner with “it girl” Julien (Jordan Alexander).

As the series returns, expect many more power plays, including the rise of Julien’s previously loyal minion and the private school’s reigning lesbian, Monet (Savannah Lee Smith). Hopefully, Max (Thomas Doherty), Audrey (Emily Alyn Lind) and Aki (Evan Mock) can avoid being sucked into any more drama. After a rocky path to polyamory, the threesome finally found themselves in a good place by the first season’s finale, making it the only healthy romance to come out of the reboot so far. Unlike in season one, which was split into two parts, fans will be able to watch what happens to the love birds in season two in a block of episodes released weekly.

“Gossip Girl” season two premiered on HBO Max on Dec. 1.

'Sort Of'

Season two of Bilal Baig’s Peabody Award-winning series, “Sort Of,” makes its way to HBO this month after premiering on Canada’s CBC in November. The final moments of season one ended with a slew of revelations. In addition to opening up to their family about their gender identity — and not without backlash — Sabi (Bilal Baig) received the news that their employer and close friend, Bessy (Grace Lynn Kung), had woken up from a coma. Despite having to face the fallout from season one’s developments, there’s hope on the horizon for the Toronto-based network of family, chosen family, friends and maybe even new lovers.

Despite the return of the family’s conservative patriarch from Dubai, Sabi’s mother (Ellora Patnaik) is clinging to their newfound closeness. Paul (Gray Powell), Bessy’s husband, is finally learning about boundaries as both his wife and Sabi, their longtime nanny, put themselves first. And, perhaps most exciting of all, Sabi’s best friend, 7ven (Amanda Cordner), may finally convince Sabi to branch out and do something for themselves — in partnership with their best friend, of course.

“Sort Of” season two premiered in the U.S. on HBO Max on Dec. 1.

'Framing Agnes'

Notable trans actors join director Chase Joynt for this experimental film that blurs the lines between documentary and narrative feature. In “Framing Agnes,” Joynt and the actors — which include Angelica Ross (“Pose”), Jen Richards (“Mrs. Fletcher”) and Zackary Drucker (“Transparent”) — use a talk-show format to re-enact interviews conducted by a UCLA clinic studying sex and gender in the 1960s.

The clinic, led by sociologist Harold Garfinkel and psychoanalyst Robert Stoller, performed some of the first gender-confirming surgeries in the country and, as part of their research, interviewed prospective patients. Perhaps the most well-known person to participate in the study was a woman called Agnes, who initially presented herself as intersex in order to qualify for treatment.

As the film delves into the story of Agnes, portrayed by Drucker, it also explores the history of transgender visibility in the United States and how, even within a marginalized community, some people have enjoyed more privilege than others. Among the consistently compelling performances, Ross stands out in the role of Georgia, a Southern transplant to Los Angeles who is making a new life in the racist and transphobic climate of the era. Outside of portraying their characters in the black-and-white, staged interviews, the actors provide frank and illuminating accounts of their own experiences as trans people living in America.

“Framing Agnes” opened in select U.S. theaters Dec. 2.

'Spoiler Alert'

Jim Parsons stars opposite Ben Aldridge in the heartbreaking film adaptation of entertainment writer Michael Ausiello’s 2017 memoir, “Spoiler Alert: The Hero Dies.” In the memoir, Ausiello chronicles his 13-year relationship with his husband, the photographer Kit Cowan, who died from colorectal cancer at 42. Parsons, who plays the TV-obsessed Michael, and Aldridge, who plays the dashing Kit, portray the highs and lows of the couple’s early romance, honeymoon phase, contentious later years and the end filled with tragedy and love. Joining them are former Broadway co-stars Sally Field and Bill Irwin, who bring their signature comedic stylings and dramatic talents to the roles of Kit’s parents. And orchestrating it all is director Michael Showalter (“The Big Sick”), whose talent for melding tragedy and romantic comedy are on display.

“Spoiler Alert” opened in U.S. theaters Dec. 2.

'Matt Rogers: Have You Heard of Christmas?'

From the high-strung assistant with a heart of gold in “I Love That For You” to the bratty but relatable Luke in “Fire Island,” Matt Rogers has turned out some of the year’s most memorable comedic performances. So, it seems only fitting that he should have a comedy special to usher in the most fabulous, fun-filled and over-the-top time of the year. “Have You Heard of Christmas?” is something between a variety show, Christmas special and late-night stand-up set at Joe’s Pub (which, incidentally, is where it was filmed). In between raunchy, original holiday songs, Rogers stars in sketches where he pitches his team on leaving comedy to become a pop star, beginning with recording a Christmas album. He also performs stand-up along with his “Las Culturistas” podcast co-host, Bowen Yang, Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson.

“Matt Rogers: Have You Heard of Christmas?” premiered on Showtime on Dec. 2.

'Women Talking'

Sarah Polley’s adaptation of Miriam Toews’ 2018 novel, “Women Talking,” based on the true story of a group of women who were subjected to sexual assault in a remote religious community, stars an impressive ensemble cast led by Rooney Mara, Jessie Buckley and Claire Foy. The film, which has been a festival audience favorite since it premiered at Telluride, also stars nonbinary actor August Winter as a character whose gender transition challenges the women’s concepts of solidarity and acceptance.

“Women Talking” opened in select U.S. theaters Dec. 2.

'The Whale'

Darren Aronofsky (“Black Swan,” “The Wrestler”) seems to have a knack for making controversial festival darlings. And his new feature, “The Whale,” starring Brendan Fraser, is no exception. In the film, Fraser plays Charlie, a 600-pound, homebound English teacher who has essentially been eating himself to death since the loss of his partner, Alan, a few years prior. Despite the best efforts of his nurse and best friend, Liz (Hong Chau), Charlie has little time left and decides to try to reconnect with his estranged daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), whom he abandoned when he met Alan. Fraser, who largely disappeared from Hollywood in the past decade after suffering a series of stunt-related injuries and allegedly being sexually assaulted, received a six-minute standing ovation at this year’s Venice Film Festival, where “The Whale” had its world premiere. And although both he and Aronofsky have since been the subject of backlash for the film’s use of a fat suit and prosthetics, it looks like the actor has a healthy chance of winning his first Oscar for the role come March.

“The Whale” opens in U.S. theaters Dec. 9.

'Nelly and Nadine'

In “Nelly and Nadine,” Swedish documentary filmmaker Magnus Gertten once again finds inspiration in an archival newsreel of German concentration camp survivors arriving in his hometown of Malmö in 1945. Like in the first film of the trilogy, “Harbor of Hope,” Gertten digs into the past of one of the reel’s many compelling faces, in this case Nadine Hwang, who met and fell in love with Nelly Mousset-Vos in 1944, when they were both imprisoned in the Ravensbrück concentration camp.

Their love story came to Gertten through Nelly’s granddaughter Sylvie, who approached the filmmaker after a screening of the second film, “Every Face Has a Name.” What Sylvie offered to Gertten was a wealth of photos, letters and Super-8 footage documenting the women’s secret, decadeslong love affair. The documentary retraces Nelly and Nadine’s great romance, from meeting in the concentration camp to being separated for the last year of the war and, finally, reuniting against all hope to live the rest of their lives together.

“Nelly and Nadine” opens in U.S. theaters Dec. 16.

'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery'

After a very short run in theaters over Thanksgiving weekend, the well-received sequel to “Knives Out” makes it’s way to Netflix for murder-mystery-loving families to enjoy over the holidays. In “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,” director and writer Rian Johnson sends Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to Greece to crash a murder-themed dinner at the private island getaway of tech tycoon Miles Bron (Edward Norton).

But the ascot-wearing Benoit isn’t there just to have fun and mingle with the glamorous guests — played by the likes of Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr. and Kate Hudson — as it seems murder may be more than just a party theme for Bron. Adding even more tension to the gathering is the arrival of the tech billionaire’s estranged, former business partner, Andi (Janelle Monáe), which seems to set everyone but Benoit on edge. In “Knives Out” style, there are plenty more twists and turns awaiting the partygoers and the audience, including a brief cameo by Hugh Grant, who plays Benoit’s partner, Philip, and cameos by the late legends Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury, in their final screen appearances.

“Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” is available on Netflix on Dec. 23.

'Babylon'

“La La Land” director Damien Chazelle’s 1920’s Hollywood fantasia, “Babylon,” has failed to impress critics ahead of its release later this month. But the cast alone is almost reason enough to brave this big-budget spectacle. Margot Robbie leads the group as Nellie Laroy, a hard-partying, scantily clad up-and-comer who has her eyeliner-rimmed sights set on becoming screen royalty. (Think silent-film sex icon Clara Bow morphing into Joan Crawford.) On her way to the top, she lures in aging screen icon Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt), modeled on silent-film star John Gilbert, and Manny Torres (Diego Calva), a Mexican-American film assistant with much bigger ambitions. But it isn’t just the men of Tinseltown who take notice. Nellie also catches the eye of Lady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li), modeled after the legendary Chinese-American actor and queer icon Anna May Wong, who could prove to be stiff competition for the boys in her signature top hat and tails.

“Babylon” opens in U.S. theaters Dec. 23.

'I Wanna Dance with Somebody'

Since Whitney Houston’s tragic death in 2012, there have been plenty of attempts to capture the singer’s life on screen — from the Angela Bassett-directed 2015 biopic “Whitney” to the 2017 documentary “Can I Be Me.” Now, working closely with Houston’s estate and her mentor, Clive Davis, screenwriter Anthony McCarten (“Bohemian Rhapsody”) and director Kasi Lemmons (“Harriet”) try their hand with “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” The biopic, which is being released just in time for Oscar consideration, stars Naomi Ackie as a still undiscovered Houston who makes her meteoric rise up the pop charts, with the help of Davis (Stanley Tucci), and explodes onto the world stage. Unlike previous onscreen portrayals, the film will also explore the singer’s relationship with Robyn Crawford (Nafessa Williams), Houston’s childhood friend who later became her creative director. The trailer for the film hints at what Crawford wrote about in her 2019 book, “A Song for You”: She and Houston had a romantic relationship that was effectively ended by industry pressures, just as their professional relationship was later ended by familial ones.

310,Brown University becomes first Ivy League school to add official caste protections,"Brown University is the latest in a string of schools to add caste protections to their nondiscrimination policies, a measure aimed at giving Dalit students official channels to report bias.

The private university in Providence, Rhode Island, is the first Ivy League school to mention casteism in its general policy, according to the Dalit civil rights organization Equality Labs. But the push for caste-equity has been sweeping schools and institutions all over the U.S. in the last few years.

“If you add caste to a nondiscrimination policy, now everybody that has to abide by that policy has to know what caste is,” said one caste-oppressed Brown graduate who spent over a year pushing for the change. “People are going to have to get trained about it. They have to make an announcement. It prompts people to think more and learn more.”

The former student requested to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation and doxxing that commonly happens to caste-oppressed activists.

Casteism, or discrimination based on that system of social stratification, defines many lives on the subcontinent and persists in South Asian communities as they immigrate to the West, experts say. Those born into lower castes face violence and oppression on subcontinent and often exclusion and hate in the diaspora.

“Caste follows the South Asian community wherever they go,” said Neha Narayan, a student who advocated for the policy change. “I’ve heard of multiple instances of people being asked coded questions … even on a couple of instances of students being asked, ‘Hey guys, what’s everybody’s caste?’”

Brown said Thursday in announcing the policy change that there’s a need for such protections as the South Asian American population grows.

“The previous policy would have protected people experiencing caste discrimination,” Sylvia Carey-Butler, Brown’s vice president for Institutional Equity and Diversity, said in a statement. “But we felt it was important to lift this up and explicitly express a position on caste equity.”

The anonymous graduate says that during her time at Brown, casteism made her feel unwelcome in spheres meant for all South Asians.

“I avoided a lot of the South Asian social spaces because of that exclusion,” she said.

Though she isn’t a student there anymore, she hopes Brown’s formal recognition of casteism will change that reality for future students.

“I’m so elated,” she said. “It’s a first step. It opens doors for dialogue that hasn’t been happening. It’s a concept that’s really misunderstood, and most people are ignorant to it.”

Before the policy change, caste wasn’t something that came up much when talking about South Asian identity on campus, Narayan said.

“It’s the most openly held secret,” she said. “Even as a caste-privileged student looking in, I can see how someone would be very alienated in that environment. In an environment where caste is never discussed, how difficult is it to speak up about caste discrimination.”

With casteism now explicitly banned in Brown’s policy, she hopes caste-oppressed students will have more avenues to talk about their experiences and seek out safe spaces with a better understanding from leaders.

Other schools, like the University of California—Davis, Brandeis University in Boston and the entire California State University system, have made similar moves after pressure from student activists backed by Equality Labs.

Last year, Harvard University added caste protections for graduate student workers, but unlike Brown’s overarching measure, Harvard’s updated policy didn’t extend to the entire student body.

“Although the road ahead towards transforming our higher education institutions to be caste equitable is still long, we are one step closer,” organizer Manmit Singh said in a statement from Equality Labs.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/brown-university-becomes-first-ivy-league-school-add-official-caste-pr-rcna59871,2022-12-05T21:57:44.518000+00:00
311,The iconic Wednesday Addams dance gets a cultural twist from Asian TikTok creators,"Netflix’s new series “Wednesday” has taken over For You pages on TikTok with a dance that many creators have made their own, including two users who’ve gone viral for their Asian and Pacific Islander twist.

""Wednesday,"" a comedy horror show and the latest “Addams Family” spinoff, was released on the streaming service last week. It follows daughter Wednesday Addams, played by Jenna Ortega, as she navigates Nevermore Academy, her psychic abilities and a murder mystery.

The dance scene, which shows Wednesday ghoulishly grooving at Nevermore Academy’s annual Rave’N dance, has mesmerized thousands on the app. The original scene, which Ortega says she choreographed, uses the song “Goo Goo Muck” by The Cramps.

The audio, which is from a fan edit and has been used over 475,000 times, shows people doing the same dance or a similar version; @raasibomma and @llalouu_ on TikTok used the viral moment to show off their own cultural moves.

Dancer and lifestyle creator @raasibomma, whose video garnered over 5 million views, showed her dressed all in black with braids performing her version of the dance in Kuchipudi — a dance style of India. Kuchipudi is a dance-drama that combines music, dancing and acting in a scene from Hindu scripture or legend.

“Wednesday’s dance but make it ✨kuchipudi✨,” her caption on the video, which was posted on Wednesday said.

TikTok users were raving about her performances in the comments.

“[T]his concept is immaculate” one user commented. “I can’t stop watching this,” another said.

@llalouu_, who is also a dancer and whose video gained over 3.5 million views, performed a blend of Polynesian dances to the audio. She was also dressed in all black with a Polynesian dancing belt called a hip hei and her hair in a braided crown.

Commentators on the video were also in awe of her performance.

“I can imagine Polynesian Wednesday being exactly like this god I love this,” one wrote.

“ATE. SLAYED. DEVOURED,” another user said.

Ortega, who choreographed the moves, thanked the choreographer Bob Fosse, Lisa Loring (the actress who played Wednesday on the original ""Addams Family"" TV show), “goths dancing in clubs in the 80’s” and others on Twitter last week for the dance’s inspiration.

The Addams Family consists of mother and father Gomez and Morticia; children Pugsley and Wednesday; butler Lurch; and extended family members Uncle Fester and Grandmama. The family is considered a parody of the American family, where the macabre yet zany unit is seemingly unaware that they frighten “normal” people.

“Wednesday” is another television adaptation in the lore of the family, which began as a single cartoon in 1938 and later developed into a television show, an animated series, a comic book and six movies across eight decades.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/wednesday-addams-tiktok-dance-gets-cultural-twist-asian-creators-rcna59843,2022-12-05T17:03:16.093000+00:00
312,"Asian American voters could help decide the Senate runoff in Georgia, experts say","Days before Georgia’s Senate runoff election on Tuesday, Sen. Raphael Warnock, the Democratic candidate, and Herschel Walker, his Republican opponent, are trying to sway an often-overlooked demographic that experts believe could decide the election.

Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, who make up 4.7% of the state’s electorate, might provide the margin of victory in an election that's expected to be a close call, and the country is taking notice.

The last few weeks have seen the formation of Georgia’s first AAPI Caucus, the appearance of campaign ads in Asian languages, and the descent of national celebrities and organizations on Georgia to help get out the Asian vote.

Asian voter turnout nearly doubled in Georgia between 2016 and 2020, AAPI Data reported last year, and those ballots amounted to more than the margin with which President Joe Biden won the state. Leading up to the Dec. 6 runoff, both parties are coveting their vote.

“Georgia is an extremely competitive state, and we have over 100,000 South Asians and 250,000 Asian Americans,” said Neil Makhija, executive director of the civic organization Indian American Impact. “We have been the margin in the past and we can easily be the margin again.”

On the ground, organizations like Makhija’s have gone door to door, encouraging the state’s large AAPI population to come to the polls.

“We’re engaging in an all-hands-on-deck effort to reach out to our community via WhatsApp and platforms that political campaigns have traditionally just ignored or not even recognized as useful,” Makhija said. “We’re also meeting people at their doors.”

When it came to appealing to South Asian voters in Georgia, Nabilah Islam, 33, said her “secret weapon” had been under her nose for years. During her recent campaign for state Senate, the Bangladeshi American brought conversations about issues to aunties and uncles on their home turf: WhatsApp.

It paid off. She's now the first South Asian ever elected to the Georgia state Senate.

Islam’s home state is looking ahead to the highly anticipated U.S. Senate runoff between Warnock, the Democratic incumbent, and Walker, a Republican.

“I think folks have come to recognize how powerful our voting bloc is,” Islam said. “We are part of the reason that candidates cross the finish line.”

Warnock and Walker make final push for AAPI support

This week, Warnock’s campaign released a series of digital campaign ads in Vietnamese, Mandarin and Korean in an effort to mobilize Asian voters.

The importance of language access can’t be understated when trying to reach minority communities, advocates said, and it’s something campaigns have historically left until the last minute — or failed to do at all.

“Very rarely are AAPIs written into the campaign plan from the beginning of the campaign,” said Varun Nikore, executive director of the nonprofit AAPI Victory Alliance. “They realize that they have to do AAPI outreach, but it’s generally not proactive — it’s reactive. It’s not a priority.”

Islam said she found success making these inroads early.

“It takes time to grow trust with minority constituency groups, including the AAPI community,” she said. “Voters come out and vote for you because they feel like they know you, because you put in the effort to show up to their brunch meet and greet or their church or the festival they put together.”

Atlanta will play host to a group of Asian lawmakers and celebrities this weekend as Warnock and his allies make one last push to rally support from the crucial demographic. Put on by the AAPI Victory Fund, the rally will feature a performance by K-pop star Eric Nam and appearances from actor Daniel Dae Kim, author Min Jin Lee and TV host Jeannie Mai Jenkins.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal will pay the state a visit this weekend, as well, kicking off a pro-Warnock canvassing event following her phone-banking efforts for the campaign.

While Walker’s campaign hasn’t seen the same support from AAPI celebrities, the former running back hosted a campaign event in September for Indian American voters. He was joined by former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is of Indian descent.

“We could win this, and all eyes are on Georgia,” Haley said at the event.

A bloc starting to gain more recognition

According to Karthick Ramakrishnan, co-director of AAPI Data, the concerted efforts to appeal to Asian voters in Georgia are reflected in nationwide politics. While AAPIs mostly vote Democratic, there’s a stronger push being made from both sides to secure their attention.

“There is increasing competition. The Democrats have stepped up their game, partly because Republicans are also increasing their efforts,” he said. “On top of that, outside of the parties, you’re also seeing an increase in messaging and influence campaigns on social media. Some of it is outright misinformation and disinformation, through channels like WeChat and WhatsApp.”

In Georgia, members of the state’s House and Senate formed a first-ever bipartisan AAPI Caucus this week. Steps like these prove grassroots efforts to appeal to AAPI voters work, Makhija said.

“There’s no substitute for actually electing people from the community,” he said. “They will have a seat at the table and bring our communities’ voices and concerns to the floor in a way we just haven’t had to this point. What’s incredible is that that’s happening across the whole country.”

Gun violence was a top noneconomic issue on AAPI voters’ minds this year, and in the state where the Atlanta-area spa shootings claimed six Asian lives last year, Ramakrishnan and Nikore say it could affect how people vote in the runoffs and beyond.

“Amongst the community, this issue probably resonates much more than in other states,” Nikore said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-american-voters-help-decide-senate-runoff-georgia-experts-say-rcna59295,2022-12-02T21:54:40.219000+00:00
313,10 best bean bag chairs for kids and teens in 2022,"Bean bag chairs are a go-to way to jazz up the room decor in a child’s bedroom or playroom— and they often became a lifesaver later on in furniture-deprived dorm rooms and apartments. With so many shapes, sizes and fabrics now available, they’ve also come a long way in terms of aesthetics and comfort. They easily serve as a cozy spot for kids and teens to lounge with a book, hang with friends or curl up and watch a movie. Plus, with so many different styles and fabrics, bean bag chairs aren’t just limited to indoor residential areas: They can be placed everywhere from an outdoor living area to a classroom.

SKIP AHEAD How to shop for a kids bean bag chair

Wherever they end up, different styles of bean bag chairs sport various fillings, covers and other features that can make choosing the right one for your kids slightly overwhelming. To help you in your search, we rounded up some highly rated bean bag options that will be great additions to your child’s bedroom, playroom or family den.

Best bean bag chairs for kids and teens

To recommend the following bean bag chairs for kids, we considered options that have removable and machine-washable covers and are filled with safe polystyrene, pellets or foam. All of the following bean bag chairs were recommended by our experts.

Best bean bag chair overall: Pottery Barn Kids

Pottery Barn is a favorite brand among our experts — and the Anywhere Beanbag can be a durable and stylish addition to your child’s bedroom or a family game room. Measuring 31 inches in diameter, this chair has a machine washable cover that’s made with 100% cotton twill, and the bean bag’s inserts are made from 50% recyclable polystyrene beads. The zippers on the inserts are sealed, which can prevent kids from accessing the beads and avoid a choking hazard, according to the brand. The Anywhere Beanbag comes in multiple colors and styles — including animal shapes like a polar bear and a cat — and can be personalized with your child’s name at an additional cost.

Best splurge bean bag chair: Lovesac

Though Lovesac can be an investment, Devin Shaffer, lead interior designer at interior design firm Decorilla, told us it’s a great brand to consider when it comes to the quality and comfort of a bean bag chair. “[Lovesac] is not afraid to go bold and, as a designer, that's what I want — don't be afraid to go with an exaggerated pattern,” he said. The Citysac — which is the smallest of LoveSac’s bean bag collection at about 3 inches wide and a little over 3 inches high — can be customized with over 150 cover color and fabric combinations, including velvet, microsuede and denim. The internal filing is made from the brand’s proprietary blend of recycled foam remnants called DuraFoam, which the brand says absorbs body weight evenly and doesn’t compress over time.

Best outdoor-friendly bean bag chair: West Elm

Shaffer said choosing a bean bag chair with covers made from outdoor-friendly fabrics like Sunbrella can be extremely beneficial when looking for durability and multi-use. “If you have the budget, go with an outdoor fabric like Sunbrella — it's meant to be outdoors without fading and you can actually pull those bean bags outside during the summer,” he said. Though this option from West Elm — a favorite brand of Shaffer’s — doesn’t have a removable or machine-washable cover, its Sunbrella fabric makes it water-repellent and resistant to fading, mildew and chlorine, according to the brand. It also has a sturdy backrest, which Shaffer also recommended to encourage comfortable lounging.

Best faux-fur bean bag chair: Pottery Barn Teen

Select’s staff has two of these faux-fur bean bag chairs in our 30 Rock office — we find the chair to be comfortable and soft, and it provides an adequate amount of support. The faux-fur chair includes a removable cover made from 100% polyester and you can choose to buy just the cover or include the insert (filled with partially recyclable polystyrene material), according to the brand. You can also purchase either a medium (36-inch diameter) or a large size (41-inch diameter). However, Shaffer noted that faux-fur is a stylistic choice compared to cotton or canvas fabrics — while they can make a bold statement in the home, Shaffer recommended sticking to a simpler style if it’s in a shared space.

Best comfortable bean bag chair: Moon Pod

Julie Shaheen, principal designer at Jewel Marie Interiors, recommended the Moon Pod as a good option if you prioritize comfort over price. “They’re quite pricey, but they come in a lot of different shapes and sizes where you can almost sleep in them,” she said. Made with the brand’s custom density beads, the chair offers an amorphous shape that’s designed to contour to your body, Moon Pod says.

Other top-rated bean bag chairs to consider

Keeping in mind our experts’ guidance, we also compiled a list of highly rated bean bag chairs that offer removable, machine-washable covers for easy cleaning and are filled with polystyrene beads, pellets or foam.

Top-rated patterned bean bag chair: Posh Creations

This lightweight and portable bean bag chair from Posh Creations — which boasts a 4.3-star average rating from over 5,500 reviews on Amazon — is available in three sizes: medium (27-inch diameter), large (38-inch diameter) and extra-large (48-inch diameter). You can also choose from over 20 removable cover options to fit your child’s style, including multi-color hearts and star patterns.

Top-rated storage bean bag chair: Jorbest

If you’re constantly trying to find a place for the array of stuffed animals in your house, this chair serves as the ultimate storage space — the fabric cover can be unzipped to stuff all the toys you need, according to the brand. (Jorbest says the 200 liter option can hold over 100 medium-sized stuffed toys). You can choose from multiple kid-friendly patterns, including dinosaurs, arrows and stars. This chair has a 4.4-star average rating from more than 3,500 reviews on Amazon.

Top-rated foam-filled bean bag chair: Big Joe

If you’re looking for a classic bean bag design to fit anywhere from the playroom to the den, this option from Big Joe is filled with ​​shredded foam, is double-stitched for durability and its cover can be easily removed and thrown into the washing machine, according to the brand. Big Joe says the chair doesn’t go flat and doesn’t need replacement filling — you can simply toss it around whenever it starts losing its shape. The cover comes in five different colors and patterns to choose from and it features handles, so you can easily move the chair around your home as needed. Big Joe’s Fuf chair has a 4.5-star average rating from over 500 reviews on Amazon.

Top-rated multi-purpose bean bag chair: CordaRoy

This hybrid seat converts from a classic bean bag chair to a full-size mattress for sleepovers and guests. You can simply zip off the removable cover and flip the inner foam-filled cushion to turn it into a bed — to convert it back to a chair, just fold it and slide it back into the cover. The cover is washer and dryer safe, and it includes an extra-long zipper that makes taking the cushion in and out of the cover quick and easy. CordaRoy’s Chenille chair boasts a 4.3-star average rating from over 7,700 reviews on Amazon.

What to consider when shopping for a bean bag chair

Bean bag chairs can be an investment, with many running upwards of $100. While the function of a bean bag chair seems fairly straightforward, our experts noted some key features to consider before committing to one.

Cover material

The cover material of your bean bag chair can range from durable canvas and soft shag covers to more high-end suede and corduroy. Many covers are removable and some can even be thrown into the washing machine for easy cleaning, which can be convenient when they’re used by kids. Depending on whether you can spot clean regularly, have small children or own any pets, the durability and ease of cleaning of the cover can be a deciding factor in the bean bag chair you get.

Both Shaheen and Shaffer also recommended looking for bean bag chairs made with performance fabric — also known as Sunbrella fabric — covers that can still be cleaned easily despite not typically being removable or machine-washable. “The difference between a performance fabric and something that's washable is that the performance fabric is treated with a chemical,” she said, adding that this chemical treatment doesn't allow a stain to sink into the fabric in the first place.

Filling material

The filling material in bean bag chairs can often dictate how much comfort and support you’re getting. Shaheen noted the main types of filling are polystyrene beads, shredded polyurethane foam (also known as memory foam) and eco-friendly pellets. Some bean bag chairs may contain microbeads — experts recommended shoppers avoid this type of filling since they are banned in several cities and states due to being harmful to the environment.

Polystyrene beads are typical in more affordable bean bag chairs since they’re lightweight and can keep the chair’s shape for a long period of time — but they ultimately don’t provide as much support and body contouring as memory foam. Many brands recommend replacing the filling of the chair regularly over time as the beads and foam can break down or compress — many brands sell replacement beads or foam separately.

Size

Smaller sized bean bag chairs may be a good starting point for toddlers and younger children, especially since too-large bean bags can be a safety risk. For older kids and teens, the size of the chair can determine its comfort level, with more oversized bean bags allowing kids to snooze on it during sleepovers or feel more comfortable during movie nights. In fact, Shaffer said he prefers an oversized chair because it can be used by teens and their friends, siblings and even parents. “Going for a chair that can accommodate at least two adults and like three to four teens and preteens is ideal,” Shaffer said.

In addition to investing in the appropriate size, you should avoid leaving an infant or small child unsupervised around bean bag chairs — never allow a child to go underneath the sacks due to heightened suffocation risks. Children should also never play with bean bag chair fillings since they can pose a choking hazard — fortunately, many bean bag chairs come with safety locks that prevent children from unzipping them.

315,How veterans can successfully transition into civilian workforce,"Switching careers is hard, but it can be particularly daunting for soldiers transitioning into civilian life.

They face a new reality that is very different from the one they are leaving behind. In fact, many feel they are at a disadvantage when it comes to finding work because they are starting over, a 2018 report found.

“Leaving the Army is a very difficult thing. They literally train you. They move your goods when you move. And they tell you what to wear and what time you show up for work,” said Bill Sweet, chief financial officer of financial planning firm Ritholtz Wealth.

Sweet understands those challenges. He served in the U.S. Army, rising to the rank of captain before leaving in 2007. During his service, he was stationed in Iraq during the Iraq War and earned a Bronze Star Medal for his actions.

Sweet was also fortunate enough to be assigned as a tax assistance officer for his battalion during his last year in active duty. That gave him a skill that ultimately lead him to his current career in finance.

Now, he wants to help other vets find success after their military careers. And there are many. Each year, about 200,000 service members return to their civilian communities.

Here are three key things veterans should focus on, according to Sweet.

Look for a translatable skill

Driving a tank in the desert probably isn’t going to translate to a job in New York City, Sweet said.

However, there are other ways to build an expertise and “ultimately take that with you in your toolkit, out to the civilian world,” he said.

“Tax was my avenue. But there’s a lot of translatable skills within a military organization.”

Those can be things like finance, public affairs and logistics, all of which are great points for your resume.

Ask for help

In the military, active service members are taught to be self-reliant.

However, when it comes to transitioning into the civilian workforce, they need to ask for help, Sweet said.

“In the military, you think you’re alone. You think you’re going to do this for the first time. No,” he said. “There’s somebody that’s walked [in] those shoes in front of you. And it’s a matter of finding them.”

There are a number of organizations that want to help and hire veterans of the military. Fourblock, a nonprofit that offers vets free semester-long, university accredited courses is one of them.

Veterans on Wall Street or VoWS, is another organization. VoWS connects military talent with Wall Street banks to get veterans into the industry.

Find a mentor

When trying to land a job or if you find yourself in a new one, try to find a mentor who can guide you by offering advice and helping you get to know the ins and outs of a given field or organization.

It will not only help you land a job or advance your career, it can also help you enjoy your work. According to a recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey survey, 9 in 10 workers (91%) said having a mentor made them significantly happier with their jobs.

Sweet credits his mentors, Ritholtz CEO Josh Brown and Ritholtz chairman and CIO Barry Ritholtz, for helping him succeed. Sweet landed at the firm several years after leaving the Army, with just one financial job under his belt.

“They were willing to take a big chance on a veteran with not a ton of experience in financial services,” he said. “I will always be grateful for that.”

316,How to Prepare for Your Job Search,"Getty Images/Hero Images

Starting the job search process can be overwhelming, but you can make it easier by focusing on your experience, skills, and interests. This will also help you develop your own brand. Use this guide as your job search plan of action:

Self-Assess: First, decide on the type of career you would like to have and consider how your experiences and skills fit into that path. After narrowing down your focus, research the positions you plan to apply for.

Brand Yourself: By determining what you have to offer, this will also help develop your brand. Play up your military experience as part of your brand, particularly for leadership and teamwork skills. The military is also a great place for learning discipline, problem-solving, communication skills, cultural understanding, project management, and how to take the initiative. To illustrate how your military training translates to a civilian workplace, explain that serving teaches people dedication, loyalty, following orders, and accomplishing goals.

Prepare: Put together your resume, pitch, and story for potential employers. This is important for networking and interviewing. Think about the skills and strengths you can play up. For example, hard skills include project management and problem-solving, while soft skills include working well with difficult people, doing a good job under pressure, negotiating or resolving conflicts, and working well managing or mentoring people.

Network: Networking is the best way to make contacts and to learn about jobs. By expanding your network, you’ll have a greater resource pool, the potential to meet more mentors, gain free advice, and get referrals for job interviews. To learn how to network, read our article here.

Apply: Use as many different sources as possible to learn about employment opportunities: search job boards, network, ask contacts, and use tools like LinkedIn. Then, apply for jobs.

Interview: During the interview, it’s crucial to show why you’re a good fit for the job. Highlight your past experiences and explain what makes you capable. To make a great first impression, always be courteous and professional. For more tips on acting an interview, read our article here.

317,How military members can avoid predatory lenders,"After serving overseas, military service members return home to face a new economic reality that often includes, unfortunately, lenders looking to take advantage of their vulnerability.

These so-called predatory lenders, which pop up around military bases, try to entice or deceive young soldiers into taking out loans that impose abusive or unfair terms.

“Predatory lenders like to prey on young military members because they’re often inexperienced with money, have little to no credit and are usually very excited to spend that first paycheck,” said certified financial planner Tara Falcone, founder of the financial education company ReisUP. She is also a former hedge fund analyst and is married to an officer in the U.S. Navy.

The end result is a loan that carries a hefty price tag, with sky-high interest rates and hidden fees. For example, if a soldier is convinced to take out a payday loan, which requires a check dated for the next payday, he could ultimately wind up with an interest rate near 400%. Unscrupulous auto lenders and credit card companies have also been known to target members of the military.

“One of my husband’s sailors came to him one day and told him that a car dealership located near base had convinced him to take out a loan for twice the value of the car ...[at] an interest rate of nearly 20%,” Falcone said.

To remedy the situation, the sailor went to a local federal credit union, got a new loan at a lower rate and then paid off the predatory loan.

“By doing that, they saved over $100 on their car payment every month and over $7,000 in interest over time,” she said.

The government has moved to crack down on predatory lending, enacting the Military Lending Act in 2006. The law caps the interest rate on most consumer loans at 36%, yet military and veteran organizations have recently expressed concern about a lack of lender monitoring.

Last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stopped checking for compliance with the law. Earlier this year, the CFPB’s new director said the agency lacked explicit supervisory authority and requested that Congress give the CFPB that power.

“What we are seeing is really a pattern of neglect around consumer protections both for consumers generally, who are targeted by payday lenders, but also a disregard for fully implementing the Military Lending Act and making sure military members are not targeted by high-cost, abusive lenders,” said Tom Feltner, director of research at the Center for Responsible Lending.

A CFPB spokesperson said the bureau is “committed to the financial well-being” of U.S. service members.

“This commitment includes ensuring that lenders subject to our jurisdiction comply with the Military Lending Act, so our servicemembers and their families are provided with the protections of that law,” the spokesperson sa However, if you’re in the military, there are some things you can do to ensure you do not become another victim. Not only does predatory lending cause undue financial stress, it can also negatively impact a soldier’s military readiness, said Falcone.

Here are four tips from Falcone that can help servicemembers protect themselves.

1. Be proactive, not reactive

When trying to get a loan, arm yourself with information before you start the process. That means knowing your credit score and familiarizing yourself with current interest rates, as well as the fair value of the item you are going to purchase, Falcone advises.

“Don’t just trust that the lender is going to tell you the right thing,” she said.

2. Know how much you can afford

You need to look beyond just the monthly payment when it comes to figuring out your budget, said Falcone. Instead, know the “all-in cost” that you can afford, which includes taxes, fees and interest.

3. Learn the language of loans

Predatory lenders may try to coerce you into making a commitment by throwing around jargon you may not fully understand. Therefore, before looking into a loan, make sure you know how the process works.

“You need to understand how lenders can manipulate all the different factors in the loan borrowing process — that includes interest, payment and term — in order to sway it in their favor and make it seem like you’re getting a really good deal,” Falcone said.

4. Ask questions

Never take out a loan unless you have the answers to any questions you may have.

“When it comes to your money, you are the authority,” Falcone said. “If you have questions, make sure to ask them and, if anything feels crazy or strange, be prepared to get up and walk away from the deal.”

318,Military spouse turned financial planner on creating wealth,"Transitioning from a civilian life to military life can be difficult, especially as a spouse. As a military spouse you are more or less tied to your partners schedule and are often not in one place long enough to set down roots let alone find a way to earn money. But former hedge fund analyst and wife to an officer in the U.S. Navy, Tara Falcone says spouses of service members do have options when it comes to creating wealth.

Falcone credits her family’s frequent moving as an inspiration to start her own business, ReisUP, as a certified financial planner, “starting my own business gives me the freedom, the freedom of location, of time and of income.”

Work remotely

The first piece of advice Falcone has for spouses is try to find a job that will allow you to work remotely. Thanks to technology it is easy to stay connected to colleagues and teams even if you are on the other side of the world.

Starting or continuing a career can seem daunting but Falcone says, “Today, spouses can and are working from home for companies in virtually every industry and at varying levels of their leadership structure.”

Common career fields include digital marketing, web design, copywriting, business development, finance, and research.

Control your investment plan

You don’t have to have a career to generate wealth for your family. Make sure the you and your service member are contributing enough to your retirement accounts.

These accounts include Thrift Savings Plan which is essentially the government version of a 401(k) plan. The TSP allows federal employees and members of the Armed Forces to save and invest for retirement in tax advantage way.

According to Falcone, the TSP offers two distinct advantages:

There are only six primary investment funds to choose from Each fund has a low expense ratio, which allows participants to keep and compound more of their investment returns.

Protect your wealth

Falcone offered some additional financial planning options and tips in a follow-up email to CNBC.

The 403(b), known as the “hip cousin” of the 401(k), is available to employees of certain schools, hospitals and non-profits.

Spousal IRAs are designed to help non-working or stay-at-home spouses contribute to retirement without having to meet the earned income requirement of a traditional IRA. While the Spousal IRA is not reserved solely for military spouses, the high unemployment rate among military spouses — as high as 24% in recent years — makes it popular.

There is no use in building up wealth if you cannot protect it. It is important to make sure that you and service member have adequate life, health, auto, disability and even pet insurance.

It is also wise to have an emergency fund for rainy days. While the amount of money in the fund can vary, most financial experts recommend at least six months of living expenses.

319,Military families find money matters complex,"Life is financially complicated for many U.S. military troops and their families.

Almost half of service members are under the age of 25, and a high percentage are married with children. They don’t get paid a lot and they must deploy repeatedly to difficult places, many times where their lives are on the line.

What other job makes someone do this?

And to be honest, even if the move isn’t to a dangerous place, it is disruptive and costs money … a lot of money.

Setting up a new household in a new location is a challenge and even more so if it is overseas. All those moves make it very difficult for military spouses to get and keep a job. Those spouses, who find it necessary to work to cover expenses, must deal with employers who know they might move to a new city at any time. That means the employer is hesitant to hire them at all.

On the plus side, troops do get benefits: housing and food allowances and health-care coverage. They may get health care on base, or they may have to use the local doctors and health-care facilities.

More from Invest in You:

And that can all change every time they move, and they do move often. As for housing, they might get a home to live in on a base, or they might get an allowance to find a home in a nearby community.

So, what do they need to do to stay financially ready, for both the military life and after they leave? First, because they tend to live on the edge financially, they need establish an emergency fund. Otherwise, the slightest event puts them in trouble and in debt and, for the troops and their families, those kinds of events can happen often and with no warning.

A service member doesn’t need to worry about the “normal” rules of having three to six months’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund. They aren’t getting laid off, so three months of expenses is an adequate target. It is crucial that service members, like anyone else, stay out of serious debt.

However, service members who find themselves in serious debt are actually considered a security risk by the military and can lose security clearance. To be blunt, service members with no clearance are useless down-range. They lose their careers.

It’s key for those in the military to start on their retirement savings as early as possible.

Starting early puts time and the power of compounding interest on their side. I know that saving for retirement might seem difficult for a struggling young person, but the military offers service members the Thrift Savings Plan. It’s the federal government’s version of the civilian 401(k) plan and will match up of 5% of savings.

By setting aside 5% of their pay in the TSP, matched by the government at 5%, a service member has created a 10% savings rate. That is perfect for the young person just starting out. After a few years, they can increase their contribution to 10% for grand total of 15%. As always, starting early makes it so much easier in the long run.

The current military retirement system is basically what is known as a “defined retirement system.” This just means that you get a set retirement based on the number of years you are on active duty. There are currently three existing retirement systems, depending on when you entered the service.

The challenge these service members face is understanding the various types of benefits they can receive. It can become quite complicated, so it’s important to seek out professional assistance.

Of course, service members need insurance coverage.

Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance is low-cost term insurance for members of the uniformed services. SGLI is a group life insurance policy purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs from a commercial life insurance company. Each service member entering a period of active duty or reserve status is automatically covered for the maximum $400,000 death benefit. They should consider the least-costly approach (term life insurance) to cover college costs for the kids and the price of a home for their spouse for the family.

Perhaps the most important thing service members and their families, or any young couple, can do is to have a budget. I call it a “spending plan.”

The idea is to spend money with a purpose to achieve your priority goals. It’s not easy to do at the start, but, once you’ve established the habit, it will sustain you for life.

By fully understanding the implications of every spending decision, a service member can keep out of financial trouble. It’s a way to avoid deep debt and will include savings plan as part of their “spending plan.” The plan puts you in control of your money.

Finally, it’s very important to have an estate plan. The Judge Advocate General office (military attorneys) will provide the basics, including important paperwork such as a will, power of attorney, health-care proxy and more.

This is key because estate planning involves making decisions about how your property — real estate, investments, Social Security, cash, life insurance and business interests — is used, maintained and distributed if you become incapacitated and after your death.

Of course, if there are children involved, a trust is often recommended. There are pro bono attorney groups that can help with the more complex issues for service members. It’s worth the time to do the homework and find these groups. There are resources to help, but the troops need to ask.

Most military installations have personal financial counselors who can help to craft a plan. There are also pro bono professional programs from groups such as the Foundation for Financial Planning, Financial Independence Training and the Financial Planning Association that can help at no cost.

Of course, service members need to be willing to ask for some assistance with their money matters. We ask them to serve and protect us, so we financial professionals can use our skills to help them. It’s only fair.

320,Combat Vet shares financial advice for military families,"Being a military service member or veteran comes with a unique set of challenges.

From time away from home and family to dealing with health care and benefits after service, it can be challenging for veterans. The good news is that there are programs available to veterans that can help with saving, investing and building wealth over time.

The following programs are positioned to give a vet some financial guidance:

Blended Retirement System (for active duty and reservists): In January 2018, the traditional military pension system was converted to the Blended Retirement System. The BRS combines elements of the legacy retirement system with benefits similar to those offered in many civilian 401(k) plans.

The program was designed to help the Department of Defense save money by reducing the costs of the existing pension system. Under the old system, a service member would have to stay in for a full 20 years to qualify for the military pension.

Fewer than 20% of service members who enlist actually choose to make the military their career and retire out. The rest would separate from service with no retirement benefits. The BRS changes that.

Here are some pros:

Provides a benefit to service members even if they choose not to spend 20 years in the military.

Includes a government match of 1% on the Thrift Savings Plan, and vesting happens after just two years.

Receive a ""continuation pay"" bonus after 12 years of service that is paid to you as cash.

The pension option is still there for you if you serve for 20 years. There is also a ""lump sum"" payout that is available to you at retirement.

Here are some cons:

Overall retirement benefit from the BRS can be lower than the original pension.

Service members who joined after January 1, 2018 no longer have access to the original pension.

It can be confusing and a bit complicated.

Requires that service members actively participate in their retirement.

Savings Deposit Program (for active duty and reservists): The Savings Deposit Program is a Department of Defense-sponsored savings account that offers deployed military members a guaranteed return on investment of 10% interest, compounded quarterly, on deposits of up to $10,000.

The program is one of the best savings options for young service members who are deployed in active combat zones around the world. The program pays 10% annualized rate of return on the contributions. In addition, the contributions are tax-free as long as they are made in a qualified tax-exempt zone. This offers an easy and effective way to put away $10,000.

Here are some pros:

Guaranteed 10% interest on contributions.

Funds and interest accumulate tax-free while service member is deployed in a qualified tax-exempt area.

Super simple to save because contributions are done through salary allotment.

Interest accrues for up to 90 days after leaving a combat zone.

Here are some cons:

You must be in a combat zone for at least 30 days or 1 day per month for 3 consecutive months to be eligible to participate.

Maximum contribution is limited to $10,000 per deployment.

You cannot make contributions once you leave the combat zone. In addition, you won't have access to the funds for 120 days after your deployment unless your balance is more than $10,000.

If there is a financial emergency, you would have to get permission from your unit commander to get an early distribution.

Thrift Savings Plan (for service members not on the BRS): The Thrift Savings Plan is the federal government's version of the civilian 401(k) plan. The rules are the same regarding contributions, distributions, required minimum distributions and so forth.

The key difference is that the TSP is the only plan that offers access to the Government Securities Investment Fund, or G Fund, in addition to four index funds. The G Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasurys, and contributions, as well as interest payments, are guaranteed by the U.S. government. This means that the G Fund cannot lose money. However, the G Fund does still have some risk.

Here are some pros:

It works like a 401(k) plan. Service members who become federal civilian employees may be eligible for a match.

The G Fund is backed by special issue Treasury bills and guaranteed by the U.S. government. It serves as a hedge against market fluctuations.

Service members can contribute while deployed to qualified tax-exempt areas. Contributions made deployed to these areas are tax-free and continue to grow tax-deferred.

Can be rolled over into a traditional individual retirement account or Roth IRA (when applicable).

Here are some cons:

The G Fund is only available in the TSP.

The G Fund is subject to inflation risk. Cost-of-living expense could potentially grow faster than the interest that accrues in the fund.

There is a limited number of investment options and no brokerage option.

There is no match for service members who are on the traditional pension retirement program.

Small Business Administration Express Loan program (for active duty, reservists and veterans): Looking to start, buy or grow a business? The SBA has you covered. An Express loan issued through the SBA 7(a) Express Loan program could give a service member the cash they need to get up and running fast.

The Express Loan Program provides up to $350,000 to start or grow a business and loans can be approved in as little as 36 hours. Service members and veterans get the added benefit of priority processing and having guaranty fees waived. That's a savings of 3% or more on the cost of the loan.

Here are some pros:

Quick turn-around and priority processing for military and veterans.

Up to $350,000 for business (including real estate purchases).

Can be structured as a line of credit or traditional loan depending on the business' needs.

Guaranty fees for SMs and veterans waived.

Here are some cons:

Interest rates may be higher than conventional loan options (SBA interest rate is the prime rate plus 4.5% to 6.5%).

Very specific limits on what can and cannot be done with the loan.

Must have excellent credit and a well-structured business plan to qualify.

Loans limited to $350,000.

321,12 Steps to Starting a Small Business,"Getty Images

Being your own boss can be immensely rewarding. Though the start-up process can seem overwhelming, it can be boiled down to a few key actions. Getting a company up and running requires planning, making important financial decisions, and completing legal paperwork, but you can start by following these 12 steps:

Step 1: Define your business and market demand

Before launching a business, make sure there is a market for your idea. Start by asking yourself a few key questions, including what problem is your business solving? Who is your customer? Who would be your existing main competitors, and how does your idea differ? Do some research to answer these questions and see how your business will stack up. The answers will help you develop an action plan—and possibly tweak your idea—to get your venture off to a successful start.

Step 2: Write a business plan

You don’t need an MBA to write a business plan. In fact, it can be as short and simple as one page. Think of it as a three to five year guide that will help you map out how to start your company and successfully run it. Your business plan should include what goods or services your company will offer, your target customer, how much you will charge, and how you’ll fund and market your product. Do research beforehand to make sure there is enough of a potential customer base. Take a close look at your defined audience and decide whether you’ll exist for a local, national or niche market, and whether you’ll run an e-commerce or physical operation.

Step 3: Fund your business

Capital is necessary to start every company. If you don’t have the cash, look beyond your own wallet. First, determine how much you’ll need and where the money will come from. If you plan to approach investors, perfect your business plan and your elevator pitch. Consider government backed loans, venture capital and research grants, as well as newly popular crowdfunding sites, in which your network of family and friends contribute to start-up costs. As a veteran, you’re entitled to a special U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan, called Patriot Express.

Step 4: Determine your business structure

Decide which form of ownership is best for you: sole proprietorship, partnership, Limited Liability Company (LLC), corporation, S corporation, nonprofit or cooperative. Your business type determines which income tax you’ll file. Each type of business structure has its pros and cons, so it’s best to consult an accountant and a lawyer, if possible.

Step 5: Choose and register a business name

A name says a lot about your business, but there’s more to picking one than being catchy—it has to be legally available. To make sure someone else doesn’t own it, check online at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. However, you can still infringe on someone else’s trademark even if it’s not registered there, so also search state and local databases. When choosing a name, keep branding in mind; the title should be clear, easy to remember and spell, and something you can grow with.

In addition to selecting your business name, you may also need to register a fictitious business name, known as a DBA (Doing Business As). A DBA is needed when your company does business under a different name, and if the company name is different from your own name.

Finally, make sure your business name is available as a web domain (omitting hyphens, if possible), then register it immediately. If the dot.com suffix is taken, try dot.net or another suffix. Avoid dot.org, unless you’re filing as a non-profit. Once your business name and domain are finalized, make business cards. They should include your name, address, email address, website, phone number, and social media links, like your Facebook page or Twitter handle. Some also include a short phrase describing their company.

Step 6: Create a marketing plan

Thanks to social media, marketing has gotten a lot easier. Build your brand’s name by expanding your company’s online presence. Create a website, a Facebook page and Twitter account, and depending on the nature of your company, considering using Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest as well. By interacting directly with your market, customers will feel more engaged. Update your website and social media accounts frequently, and read up on SEO (search engine optimization) to maximize your web presence. Another effective tactic is email marketing: Build a list of potential customers, business associates and colleagues (you can have them sign up on your website), and send them regular updates.

Step 7: Get a Tax Identification Number

To mark your business as a separate legal entity, you’ll need to obtain a Federal Tax Identification Number, also referred to as an Employer Identification Number (EIN). Similar to a social security number, a tax ID lets the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) track business transactions. Though they aren’t mandatory for sole proprietors, they’re recommended so that you don’t have to use your social security number for business practices. The application process is free, quick and simple; apply online at the IRS website.

Step 8: Open a business bank account

Never mix your personal and business bank accounts, which could lead to a run-in with the IRS and affect your mortgage and loan payments, as well as other personal finances. Instead, use a business bank account for all of your company’s transactions. Open one in the name of your business and EIN. Additionally, you may want to open a business credit card to avoid using a personal one for company matters.

Step 9: Figure out your taxes

Your business structure will determine the types of taxes you’ll have to pay. All businesses, except for partnerships, are required to file an annual income tax return. Depending on whether or not you have employees, you may also have to pay employment taxes (which include social security and Medicare taxes) and a self-employment tax. Additionally, decide if you’ll pay taxes according to the calendar year or the fiscal year (you can determine that schedule).

Step 10: Get the necessary licenses and permits

While every locality has different requirements, all demand business licenses—even if yours only exists online. Make a list of federal, state and local licenses and permits required for your business. (Find more information here.) If you have a physical storefront, familiarize yourself with zoning laws from the county clerk’s office. Use your company’s EIN instead of your Social Security number when filing paperwork.

Step 11: Learn relevant laws and regulations

If you’re starting an online business, contact the Federal Trade Commission to learn about e-commerce regulations.

If you’re hiring employees, spend time with an employment law professional to learn and understand the legal steps you need to take. Familiarize yourself with federal and state payroll and withholding taxes, unemployment insurance, anti-discrimination laws, workers’ compensation rules, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, and wage and hour requirements.

Step 12: Set up your accounting system

Bookkeeping can be simple, at least when you first start your business. Begin with an Excel spreadsheet that lets you track money you spend and receive; include columns for revenues and expenses, and add more as you go. When you’re ready for a more formal system, invest in business accounting software like QuickBooks.

322,Military families say this is their top concern,"Members of the military face hurdles every day — and financial challenges are among some of the biggest.

Eric Wanner, a sergeant in the U.S. Army, and his wife, Jana, have moved four times in the last 12 years — most recently to Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

Because of frequent deployments and moving expenses, as well as cost-of-living adjustments and erratic pay, the couple struggles when it comes to managing their household finances.They are raising a family on a single military income.

For example, “when we came back from overseas we had to rent a car for two months while we waited for our other car to get shipped,” said Jana Wanner. “That was a massive expense.”

In fact,service members and their spouses ranked financial stress as their greatest concern, even over deployment, according to Blue Star Families’ annual military family lifestyle survey.

Members of the Arizona National Guard listen to instructions on April 9, 2018, at the Papago Park Military Reservation in Phoenix. - Arizona deployed its first 225 National Guard members to the Mexican border on Monday after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the frontier region to combat drug trafficking and illegal immigration.

Nearly 9 in 10 active service members and 84% of spouses or partners have worries about personal finances, according to a separate report by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, which also did the same survey of military personnel five years ago.

Rather than have some of those challenges subside as the economy improved, more military families are worried about meeting basic household needs and debt payments today than in 2014, the NFCC found.

In fact, service members are now twice as likely not to be able to pay all their bills on time than they were just a few years ago.

Roughly 3 in 10 spouses or partners of service members said they do not pay their bills on time and about 1 in 10 said they currently have debts in collection, according to the survey.

Still, because of issues such as increased childcare costs during periods of deployment and the likelihood of relocation, it can be hard for spouses to find full-time employment to supplement their military incomes and build retirement savings.

As a result, about half of service members and their spouses of service members say they rely on the gig economy to stay afloat, the NFCC found.

In general, people are struggling to make ends meet, said Rebecca Steele, president and CEO of the NFCC. That’s “amplified in military households.”

“Men and women in uniform face many challenges and daily sacrifices while serving our country,” she added. “Financial concerns shouldn’t be one of them.”

To that end, Josh Andrews, a certified financial planner and advice director at financial services firm USAA in San Antonio, offers the following tips to active duty military and their spouses or partners:

Start early

Beginning with your first paycheck, opt to take the full Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance coverage amount and increase automatic contributions to the military’s Thrift Savings Plan to at least 10%.

With what is left, learn to live well within your means — spend less than you earn and put what you can into an emergency fund.

Pay down debt

If you do have debt, develop an attack strategy. Figure out which loans are costing you the most, and make it a priority to pay those off first.

Payday loans, also called cash advances, are the worst offenders, with interest rates that can easily run into the triple digits.

Plan for the inevitable

Consider where you will be living with every Permanent Change of Station, or PCS, and then adjust your budget accordingly.

From groceries to gasoline, the cost of living can vary substantially by location.

Take a long-term view

The majority of those in the military do not serve until retirement. Consider other education options and training programs and make sure a transition plan for benefits, including health insurance and pensions, is secured before departure from the service.

You can keep on top of the many benefits the military offers, as well as whatever financial education it makes available, through Military OneSourceor other channels.

For its part, the NFCC offers financial education and credit counseling through its member agencies.

Institutions such as USAA also regularly work with current and former service members and offer a range of banking and insurance products.

And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau site for service members has many resources related to protecting finances and planning for the future.

325,The History Of Veterans Day: How To Celebrate With Kids,"For kids, Veterans Day may be a confusing day they do not fully understand, or maybe it's associated solely with getting a day off school.

For military families, Veterans Day marks an opportunity to thank the people they love most.

""My kids are fortunate to have a father who has served in the Navy their entire lives,” Laura Maxwell told TODAY Parents. ""On Veterans Day, we take time out to highlight what it means to live a life of sacrifice — how all the moves, all the goodbyes, all the new schools, moving trucks, and crazy schedules aren’t for nothing. They matter to our country.""

How can parents help kids honor our veterans? A good start is to educate them on the history of Veterans Day and why we celebrate, followed by some easy activities.

Remember why we celebrate Veterans Day

Each year, Veterans Day is observed on Nov. 11, regardless of the day of the week. Why Nov. 11? It’s the day that signifies the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when World War I ended.

The holiday was originally called Armistice Day and was observed for the first time on Nov. 11, 1919 — the first anniversary of the end of World War I. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower officially changed the name of the holiday from Armistice Day to Veterans Day — a day to honor American veterans of all wars for their patriotism and willingness to serve and sacrifice.

Thank a veteran together

“A great way for parents and kids to say thank you to our veterans is by creating a card, letter or poster,"" says Kitty Harris, a Navy veteran and mom from San Diego, California. ""Art is a fun way for children to express themselves and show their appreciation for our veteran communities while social distancing.”

Maddie Clegg, 6, is the daughter of Air Force Lt. Col. Nathaniel Clegg, and wanted to help celebrate veterans like her dad.

“She drew a soldier in a flight suit with a hat and an American flag, because that’s how she sees the military every day at home,” Maxine Clegg, Maddie’s mom shared with TODAY Parents.

Make a call or plan a virtual celebration

Celebrating the day can be as simple as calling a veteran to have a meaningful conversation about their story serving our country. If you don’t have a family member who’s a veteran, ask friends and others in your network if they know a veteran.

Because virtual meetings grew in popularity during the pandemic, organizing a Zoom call honoring family military members can be an easy activity. Everyone on the call could wear military tees or the colors of their favorite branch of the military and share service photos and stories of the veterans in your life.

Decorate your house and yard

Looking to keep the celebrations at home? Parents can have kids paint rocks red, white, and blue with messages of gratitude to place in a garden or create homemade posters to place in the windows or on the front door. Harris suggests that kids decorate the sidewalk with colorful chalk to create a special “Thank You” that honors veterans. Pinterest is full of craft ideas, from homemade handprint American flags and patriotic wind socks to wreaths and fans.

Watch veterans share their oral histories

The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City has a unique Oral History Project, which collects first-hand stories of those who served on board the Intrepid, the submarine Growler, and more.

Susan Marenoff-Zausner, president of the museum, says watching the stories is a great way for families to get a real feel for what military life is like. ""Watching these interviews, which vividly depict triumphs and even lighthearted moments from times of service, can encourage meaningful conversations and a deeper understanding of why it’s so important to recognize our brave service men and women,” Marenoff-Zausner said.

Take a virtual tour of war memorials

This virtual tour includes stops and information about numerous war memorials, including the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Women’s Memorial, and the United States Marine Corps War Memorial.

Watch a wreath-laying ceremony

Every Veterans Day, memorials across the country — including Arlington National Cemetery — hold wreath laying ceremonies. Be sure to check the individual websites of your local memorials and Arlington National Cemetery for information on possible virtual commemorations of Veterans Day.

326,Female veterans criticize gender disparities in VA medical system,"HOUSTON — Navy veteran Tana Plescher said she was shocked by what a doctor told her when she sought care for a panic attack at a Veterans Affairs medical center in Texas.

“You’re a woman; I don’t know what to do with you,” she said he remarked.

The state’s restrictive abortion laws spotlight existing gender disparities within the VA medical system, according to former military women who shared their personal experiences during a listening tour held by Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health.

The VA does not provide any abortion services, even initial consultations, to women seeking more information about terminating their pregnancies. Unlike the Department of Defense, which provides abortions on military bases in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is at risk, the largest population of female veterans nationwide are left without options in Texas.

“We spent our whole career assimilating into a male world. And that doesn’t end when we get out,” veteran Amber Davila, 37, said outside of the session in Austin, Texas. “Why should we have to assimilate into male health care? We are biologically different.”

Amber Davila. Amber Davila

Before the birth of her daughter, Davila said she had multiple miscarriages that required a dilation and curettage procedure to remove abnormal tissue from her uterus. The procedure, and other surgeries used to treat pregnancy complications, may now be illegal under Texas abortion laws.

In 2016, Davila went to a San Antonio VA clinic with severe pain in her stomach and back. Although San Antonio is known as “Military City, USA” for its large concentration of military bases, the clinic at the time had just one gynecologist and a single ultrasound machine, she said.

“The service that I received was naproxen and toughen up,” Davila said, referring to the anti-inflammatory drug. She said a procedure she underwent to treat her uterine fibroids failed, but instead of taking her concerns seriously, the doctors sent her for a colonoscopy.

“An entirely unnecessary treatment, just wasting time with my pain,” she said.

Fast-forward to this year, and Davila said she had had enough. She sought care from a gynecologist outside of the VA, paying out of pocket for an emergency hysterectomy.

“I suffered for four years with cyclical pain. I had no choice. The only treatment was to remove my uterus, and my cervix,” Davila said, emotionally recounting her experience. “So I have one child, and I don’t have the opportunity to have other children.”

Davila is now chief communications officer for The Pink Berets, an organization founded by veteran Stephanie Gattas to help women who served in the military deal with issues such as sexual trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Lucy Del Gaudio, chief operations officer for the organization, was raped in the early 1990s while in active-duty service, she said.

Lucy Del Gaudio served in the U.S. Army. U.S. Army

“My eldest is a product of my assault,” she told Brownley in a room filled with women of all ages, many of whom recounted similar experiences.

One in four women report being sexually harassed on military bases, and most of them don’t speak up about their experiences in fear of retaliation, according to a 2021 study by the Rand Corp. research organization.

Del Gaudio said she, and not her abuser, was discharged when she became pregnant and deemed unfit to serve by her superiors. She lost her military benefits, experiencing homelessness while her mental health deteriorated.

“It took a long time to find myself,” she said in an interview. When she finally realized she needed help, Del Gaudio turned to the VA but found their facilities for women inadequate, especially compared to the care men received.

“We raised our right hand, so we should get the services that we rightly deserve,” she said. “And that’s all we expect — we want to get the services that our male counterparts get when they go to the VA.”

Democratic lawmakers say the VA can expand services to include abortion care under existing law. Last month, senators on the Armed Services Committee pressed the agency to “take immediate administrative action to offer abortions and all abortion-related services to veterans and eligible dependents.”

Angela Shinn, who served as an Army officer, asked Brownley at the Austin session, “Why is the VA not doing any women’s health care for abortion? Why is that not happening?”

The VA denied multiple requests for comment but said in a statement that an estimated 300,000 women veterans of childbearing age rely on the agency for health care, including contraception, fertility care and maternity care.

“We will continue to make sure they have timely access to the full suite of reproductive care,” the VA said.

Women are the fastest-growing cohort in the veteran community, but some are concerned abortion restrictions could impact recruitment, which is at a low point across all branches of the military.

“This is fuel to the fire,” said Plescher, lead outreach coordinator for Grace After Fire, a female veterans group based in Houston. “We stood side by side, shoulder to shoulder when we served. There wasn’t a problem. I was the most visible service member, and I’m the most invisible veteran. Why? Why is that?”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/female-veterans-criticize-gender-disparities-va-medical-system-rcna43948,2022-08-19T23:09:29.074000+00:00
327,Biden signs bill to expand benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed legislation on Wednesday expanding health care benefits for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.

The bipartisan bill, known as the PACT Act, is the most significant expansion of veterans' health care and benefits in more than 30 years, a White House official said.

Speaking at a White House ceremony, Biden said that “veterans of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan not only faced dangers in battle — they were breathing toxic smoke from burn pits.”

Biden said he traveled to Iraq over 20 times over the course of the war, both as a senator and later as vice president, and could “actually see some of it in the air.”

“Burn pits the size of football fields, an incinerated waste of war such as tires, poisonous chemicals, jet fuel, and so much I won’t even mention,” he said. “A lot of places where our soldiers were sleeping were literally a quarter mile half mile away from it.”

Veterans who have been exposed to burn pits attended the signing ceremony along with their families, advocates and members of Congress.

Danielle Robinson and Brielle Robinson, the wife and the daughter of Sgt. 1st Class Heath Robinson whom the PACT Act is named after, introduced Biden at the signing event. Danielle Robinson was a guest of first lady Jill Biden during the president's first State of the Union address when he called on Congress to pass burn pits legislation.

The issue is personal for Biden. His son Beau Biden was deployed to Iraq in 2008 and diagnosed with brain cancer in 2013. He died two years later, at age 46. Biden has said he believes Beau’s cancer was linked to exposure to burn pits during his deployment.

“When they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same. Headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,” Biden said at Wednesday's ceremony. “My son Beau was one of them.”

Experts have said that while it is difficult to draw a definitive link between burn pit exposure and certain health problems like cancer and asthma, long-term exposure to toxic smoke can lead to serious health issues.

The White House official said Biden was closely engaged with lawmakers during negotiations over the measure.

The legislation increases veterans' access to medical care and disability payments for exposure to burn pits. It also requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to presume some respiratory illnesses and cancers were related to the exposure, meaning veterans don't have to prove they got sick because of the burn pits in order to receive compensation for their illnesses. Roughly 70% of disability claims related to burn pit exposure are denied by the VA due to lack of evidence, scientific data and information from the Department of Defense, according to The Associated Press.

The Senate ultimately passed the legislation in a 86-11 vote last week after Republicans had blocked its passage the week before.

The Senate had already voted 84-14 in June to advance the bill, but 25 Republicans who voted yes reversed course when the legislation came up again. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., had been one of the Republicans holding up the bill as he demanded a vote on his amendment to add spending guardrails to ensure some of the massive package, costing $280 billion over 10 years, could not be spent on ""completely unrelated programs.""

Republicans eventually caved to pressure from more than 60 veterans groups — and comedian Jon Stewart — who had railed against the GOP members for days outside the Capitol.

328,Senate passes veterans health bill after Republicans cave in to pressure,"WASHINGTON — The Senate passed legislation Tuesday to expand lifesaving health care benefits for Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.

Senators voted 86-11 after Republicans agreed to lift their blockade of the popular bill, caving in to pressure from more than 60 veterans groups — and comedian Jon Stewart — who had railed against Republicans for days outside the Capitol.

Many of the veterans who had camped on the Senate steps, braving heat, humidity and thunderstorms, watched the vote from the gallery in the Senate chamber. The bill has already cleared the House and now heads to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature.

It's ""very emotional. [These are] tears of joy and relief,"" said Jen Burch, 35, a retired Air Force staff sergeant who suffers from numerous ailments she believes were caused by exposure to burn pits and open sewage ponds in Afghanistan.

""This is our night to celebrate, but we have more work to do to continue advocating and to ensure the [Department of Veterans Affairs] does their job in implementing this legislation for our veterans.""

Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough said his agency will act quickly after Biden signs the measure.

""Once the President signs this bill into law, we at VA will implement it quickly and effectively, delivering the care these Veterans need and the benefits they deserve,"" McDonough said in a statement.

Biden lauded the bill’s passage Tuesday evening, calling it a “lifeline” to families who had lost loved ones because of toxic exposure.

“Congress has delivered a decisive and bipartisan win for America’s veterans,” Biden said in a statement. “For the millions of veterans who may have been exposed to harmful toxins, this bill means quicker access to health care services and other benefits. This could be the difference between life and death for many suffering from toxic related illnesses.”

Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaking on the Senate floor, said that with passage of the PACT Act, ""veterans across America can breathe a sigh of relief.""

He then joined Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester, D-Mont., to thank the vets outside the Capitol for their advocacy. ""The treatment that they have deserved and have needed but have been denied because of the VA, because of all sorts of legal barriers and presumptions, will now be gone,” he said.

""Veterans who were exposed to the toxic fumes of burn pits will be treated by the VA like they should have been from the very beginning,"" Schumer added.

Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania had been one of the Republicans holding up the bill as he demanded a vote on his amendment to add spending guardrails to ensure some of the massive package costing $280 billion over 10 years could not be spent on ""completely unrelated programs."" Democrats disputed Toomey's characterization, saying the money would be spent only on veterans.

""I'm supposed to trust this and future Congresses not to go on a spending spree? Seriously? That's unbelievable,"" Toomey said before the vote. ""Why did they design this feature so that they could go on a spending spree?""

Toomey had insisted that his amendment be brought to the floor with a 50-vote, simple-majority threshold. In the end, he and other Republicans gave in to Schumer’s demands that three GOP amendments would get votes with a higher 60-vote threshold, essentially ensuring their defeat. All fell well below that bar.

The Senate had already voted 84-14 to pass the burn pits bill in June, but 25 Republicans who voted yes reversed course when the legislation came up again last week, many of them echoing Toomey's spending concerns and arguing that Democrats did not give them a chance to amend the package. Democrats and veterans argued, however, that many Republicans were voting against the bill in retaliation for the massive deal on climate change, health care and taxes that Democrats had just crafted.

With some veterans literally sleeping on the steps of the Capitol over the weekend, the Republican blockade became increasingly untenable.

""I think they’re fraying in terms of their ability to withstand this,"" Stewart, who has also fought for funding for 9/11 first responders and their families, told NBC News before Tuesday's deal was announced.

""I think this is cruel and unusual punishment that’s going on, and they’ve got to end this.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-passes-veterans-health-bill-republicans-cave-pressure-rcna41215,2022-08-03T01:16:57.935000+00:00
329,Veterans have been camping out on the Capitol steps after GOP blocks burn pit bill,"WASHINGTON — Jen Burch, 35, a retired staff sergeant in the Air Force, looks strong and healthy from the outside. She says that inside, however, she’s suffering from ailments that she believes are related to her service during the Afghanistan war more than a decade ago.

While they were in Kandahar, Burch and her fellow service members were exposed to “burn pits, incinerators and poo ponds,” she said. When she left, she battled pneumonia and bronchitis. And in the years since then, she has been “in and out of ERs” and has struggled with intense migraine headaches and shortness of breath whenever she climbs a flight of stairs.

“I actually ended up trying to take my life because I just can’t handle it anymore. I just go crazy in my head,” Burch said at a rally Monday outside the U.S. Capitol.

Burch, a Washington native, is one of dozens of military veterans who spent the weekend protesting Republicans' blockade of a bill that would provide lifesaving benefits for veterans exposed to so-called burn pits and other toxic phenomena.

The veterans camped out on the steps outside the Senate all weekend, braving the heat, the humidity and occasional thunderstorms and sleeping on the hard concrete stairs. Burch said she wanted to camp there, too, but she began feeling intense pain.

The protest by 60 veterans groups — along with comedian Jon Stewart — has put Senate Republicans on the defensive as they’ve struggled for days to explain why they are holding up legislation that would provide much-needed health care for millions of veterans exposed to things like burn pit smoke, Agent Orange and radiation.

At times, lawmakers and officials, including Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough, joined the protesters to urge the Senate to pass the PACT Act. President Joe Biden, isolating after another positive Covid test, reached out to the vets by videoconference.

Burch said in an interview: “If there is one group that’s not going to give up, it’s us. We have fought tougher battles. We’ve had bloodshed. This is getting over an obstacle because we refuse to be defeated.”

As they told their stories Monday, veterans held signs that read “Senators are lying while vets are dying. Pass the #PACTAct” and “Burn Pits Kill. Delaying the PACT Act Kills. Republicans Delayed and Killed War Veterans.”

Another sign listed the names of all of the Republicans who had joined Democrats in passing the PACT Act in June and then reversed course last week and filibustered the bill: “25 Republicans are killing vets and the PACT Act.” (The bill needs to be passed by the Senate again because of a minor technical change made by the House.)

“As far as I can see, it passed 84 to 14, and then 25 Republicans switched their vote. So to me, that’s the problem,” Stewart told NBC News outside the Capitol. “Switched it without an explanation, switched it without pointing to the bill and saying what was inserted. … Switched it without pointing to the bill and saying where the pork was. … They just keep going, ‘It’s a budget gimmick.’”

Stewart has reserved special ire for Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who has argued that he is worried that some of the $280 billion in spending over 10 years would be used for other Democratic priorities. Democrats and veterans groups have rejected the argument and accused the GOP of blocking the bill in retaliation for the massive climate and economic deal Democrats struck last week.

Toomey suggested Sunday on CNN that Democrats were using the veterans as political props and took a jab at Stewart, the former “Daily Show” host, calling him a “pseudo-celebrity.” Toomey is demanding a vote on his amendment to add stricter rules for how the money would be spent.

“This is the oldest trick in Washington,” Toomey said. “People take a sympathetic group of Americans — and it could be children with an illness, it could be victims of crime, it could be veterans who’ve been exposed to toxic chemicals — craft a bill to address their problems and then sneak in something completely unrelated that they know could never pass on its own and dare Republicans to do anything about it, because they know they’ll unleash their allies in the media and maybe a pseudo-celebrity to make up false accusations to try to get us to just swallow what shouldn’t be there. That’s what’s happening here.”

Asked whether he was offended that Toomey had called him a pseudo-celebrity, Stewart took the criticism in stride: “That’s the one thing I’ve agreed with throughout this whole process.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/veterans-started-camping-capitol-steps-gop-blocks-burn-pit-bill-rcna40981,2022-08-02T16:13:44.058000+00:00
330,"Warnock beats Walker in Ga. runoff, growing Democrats’ Senate majority","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

ATLANTA — Democrat Raphael G. Warnock on Tuesday was projected to win reelection to represent Georgia in the Senate, defeating Republican Herschel Walker in a tight runoff and expanding his party’s slim majority in the chamber. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight It was a hard-fought victory for Democrats in an increasingly purple state that was central to the party’s gains last election cycle and is expected to be a key battleground in 2024. Rural turnout for Walker, 60, a former Georgia football star, was not enough to offset a strong Atlanta-area performance by Warnock, 53, a pastor at a historic church in the city.

Warnock’s win gave Democrats their 51st Senate seat — handing them more leverage in a chamber that for two years has been evenly split, with Vice President Harris empowered to break ties and two swing-vote Democrats able to make or break their party’s plans.

The result also capped a disappointing midterm cycle for Republicans, who expected a red wave but fell short of retaking the Senate and reclaimed the House majority by a margin of just a few seats. Walker, a first-time candidate ridiculed for gaffes, accused of serious misconduct and elevated by former president Donald Trump, exemplified broader Republican concerns that their nominees — and Trump — undermined their chances. His loss spurred more calls to rethink the party’s direction and strategy.

With more than 97 percent of the vote counted Tuesday night, Warnock led Walker by nearly 2.5 percentage points. An estimated 3.5 million people voted in the runoff, slightly down from the 3.9 million ballots cast in the general election.

The DJ at Warnock’s election night party played “All I Do Is Win” by DJ Khaled right after CNN posted that Warnock was projected to win. Declaring victory late Tuesday, Warnock said he was honored to “utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy” — “the people have spoken.”

“I’m proud of the bipartisan work I’ve done,” he said, “and I intend to do more because I actually believe that at the end of the day, we’re all Americans.”

Walker’s supporters gathered in a prayer circle at the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta as media outlets began to call the race. Conceding Tuesday night, Walker said he would not be making excuses for his loss because “we put out one heck of a fight.” Throughout the campaign, he criticized the incumbent as a reliable vote for President Biden’s agenda and said he would check Democrats’ power in Washington and represent “Georgia values.”

Warnock campaigned on Democratic priorities such as legislation to cap drug prices and appealed directly to independents and moderate Republicans, calling Walker unfit for public office and saying the race should come down to “character and competence.” He also promised to support abortion access, as his opponent embraced strict bans that took effect in Georgia and other states after the fall of Roe v. Wade — setting up a stark contrast on an issue that helped galvanize Democrats nationally in an otherwise daunting election year.

Kyle Cartledge, an independent, said he backed Warnock because Walker’s gaffes and the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe alienated him from Republicans this year.

“I wish we had more of a middle, but we don’t seem to have one these days,” said William Shank, who voted for Walker but said he was unenthused about his options.

In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Warnock would serve as “the last brick in our firewall” against GOP threats to democracy.

Both parties always expected a close contest and lined up colossal resources, with candidates and outside groups spending a combined $380 million on ads for the seat throughout the election cycle. The campaigns focused heavily on in-person get-out-the-vote efforts during the runoff, saying the result would hinge on each candidate’s ability to turn out their base a second time.

Republicans hoped that frustration with Biden and the economy would remain powerful motivators and enlisted surrogates for Walker, including Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who had kept a distance from the Senate nominee during his own reelection fight.

But as Tuesday neared, some expressed growing doubts about Walker’s ability to bring out a winning coalition without more popular Republicans such as Kemp on the ballot. The GOP’s challenges only seemed to compound in the runoff, with Republicans feuding openly and Democrats growing their spending advantage.

Outside groups helped Walker try to catch up to Warnock’s record-breaking fundraising in the general election and invested more the past four weeks. But Democrats ultimately spent about twice as much as Republicans on ads in the runoff, pumping roughly $60 million more into the race.

While Democrats entered the runoff with the Senate majority in hand, a 51st seat will still have big consequences. Democrats are now expected to get a one-seat majority on committees, which are currently evenly split under a power-sharing agreement with Republicans. That will speed up the confirmation process for judicial and executive nominees by averting tied votes and give Democrats more leverage in oversight hearings.

Another seat will also allow Democrats more room to confirm appointees and pass bills over objections from within their caucus. Two moderate senators, Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), currently wield tremendous power to reshape or scuttle legislation. And it boosts Democrats’ position heading into an ominous 2024 Senate map, where they will have to defend many vulnerable incumbents and have tougher odds for a pickup.

Warnock’s win marks the first time in more than a century that all incumbent senators were reelected, and the first time since 1934 that a president’s party gained both Senate and governor’s seats in a midterm. Democrats won two more governorships this cycle.

Karen Schultz, 66, said she almost didn’t come out to vote given the rain and foggy weather in the metro Atlanta area. But “I felt so guilty and I told my husband, ‘We just have to go vote. We have to do our part,’” she said.

Republicans did well in Georgia last month despite their national shortfalls; Kemp won handily in a rematch with Democrat Stacey Abrams. Yet Walker got about 200,000 fewer votes than Kemp, becoming the only statewide GOP candidate not victorious on Nov. 8. Warnock ran about 1 percentage point ahead of Walker in the general election but fell short of the 50 percent required to win outright in Georgia.

Walker gave his final rally in Kennesaw, Ga., flanked by GOP leaders including Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who called his race a “critical seat that will allow us to stop Joe Biden and the Warnock disastrous agenda that is killing our country.”

Speaking at the same event, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley called the runoff an opportunity for Republicans to show that the state’s recent election of Biden and two Democratic senators was a “hiccup.”

In an interview Tuesday night, Dianne Putnam, the chair of the Whitfield County Republican Party, insisted that Georgia remains “a red state.”

“The people just didn’t vote straight down like they should have and that’s usually what Republicans do,” she said of Walker trailing Kemp in November. “I don’t understand that, I really don’t. It’s a mystery to me.”

Ben Burnett, a conservative podcast host and former city councilman in a suburb of Atlanta, echoed calls for the GOP to take a hard look at its strategy. “Winning in the suburbs needs to be the first question that the GOP asks, not the last question that we never answer,” he said.

With nearly 2 million ballots cast before Tuesday, the runoff stoked increasingly vocal GOP concerns about their party’s reliance on a big turnout Tuesday over early voting. Democrats were buoyed by high Black voter turnout last week and said they believed they had the GOP outmatched on the ground, despite Republican investments to repurpose Kemp’s get-out-the-vote operation the past month.

Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church — where the Rev. Martin Luther King once preached — will now serve a full, six-year term. Last year, he won a special election to replace Republican Johnny Isakson, who stepped down over health concerns, and became Georgia’s first Black senator.

He and fellow senator from Georgia, Jon Ossoff (D), both prevailed in a January 2021 runoff that gave Democrats control of the Senate and underscored the state’s shifting political identity. In 2020, Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the traditionally conservative state since Bill Clinton in 1992.

Some Republicans blamed Trump for undermining their party’s chances in the runoff by focusing on his own loss in the lead-up, pressuring Georgia officials to overturn the results and spreading GOP distrust of the voting system.

Trump also loomed over the 2022 midterms, often boosting inexperienced or polarizing candidates to primary victories in battleground races. He endorsed Walker but stayed away from Georgia during the general election.

“It’s not his time to come — not his time and place right now,” Fulton County Republican Party Chairman Trey Kelly said of Trump on Tuesday evening.

Trump and Walker’s teams agreed the former president’s presence would not be helpful during the runoff, according to Trump advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations. Walker did not advertise a Monday tele-rally with Trump on social media or allow reporters to attend. He did tout the endorsement of another Republican on Facebook that same day — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an increasingly formidable rival to Trump who could challenge him for the presidency in 2024.

Biden also avoided campaigning in Georgia, as Republicans emphasized that Warnock has voted with the president 96 percent of the time and sought to harness widespread dissatisfaction with the direction of the country.

While both Senate candidates attacked each other’s character, allegations from Walker’s past dominated the race. Ex-partners of Walker accused him of domestic violence, said he had little contact with his children and alleged that he paid for their abortions despite his antiabortion views. One of Walker’s sons, who is conservative, harshly criticized Walker this fall and responded scathingly to the outcome on Tuesday, tweeting, “Don’t beat women … fund abortions then pretend [you’re] pro-life ... leave your multiple minor children alone to chase more fame, lie … And then maybe you can win a senate seat.”

Walker has spoken openly about a struggle with dissociative identity disorder, and allies pitched him on the trail as a devout Christian who has been redeemed for past mistakes. The GOP nominee denied the abortion claims and some allegations of violence, while saying he cannot remember other incidents.

Democrats worked to highlight Walker’s most puzzling comments from the campaign trail, including a riff about vampires and werewolves, releasing one runoff ad that featured voters listening to sound bites and calling the candidate embarrassing.

Republicans defended Walker’s personal record while leaning into his celebrity status as a former running back at the University of Georgia. They said Warnock was not the “saint” Democrats portrayed, broadcasting allegations from Warnock’s ex-wife that he ran over her foot with a car during an argument. Warnock denies the claim, and law enforcement did not file charges.

335,Takeaways from Warnock’s win over Walker in Georgia Senate runoff,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.) won reelection in the Georgia runoff on Tuesday night, turning aside a challenge from Republican former football star Herschel Walker. With 94 percent of the expected vote in, Warnock leads by one percentage point. The Associated Press and Edison Research have called the race for the Democratic senator.

The result means all Senate races have been decided. With Democrats having gained one seat in the 2022 elections, they will hold a 51-49 majority come next month.

Below are some takeaways.

1. How Warnock did it

Georgia runoff elections were very favorable for Republicans until very recently. But in recent cycles, that’s been turned on its head. Warnock leads by one point right now — similar to his margin on Election Day four weeks ago — but that’s likely to grow. Similarly, Democrats in the 2020-2021 Georgia Senate runoffs overturned Election Day deficits to win both seats and take the Senate.

The reason appears to boil down to Democrats’ successful effort to turn out voters early, particularly in the Atlanta area, and the fact that turnout in blue areas was simply stronger relative to the general election.

One thing you’ll notice if you look at the map of the election results is that Walker often ran stronger in the state’s rural and ruby-red counties than he did four weeks ago. But Warnock ran even stronger in the metro Atlanta area and along the rural “Black Belt” further to the south, compared to Nov. 8, and turnout was stronger there.

Turnout everywhere was very high for a runoff, and it looks like it will end up around 90 percent of the total vote on Election Day. But it was higher in blue counties, and it dropped the most in the most conservative part of the state, north Georgia.

How much that owes to Democrats’ efforts — versus, say, Republicans running a lackluster candidate who didn’t have a popular governor like Brian Kemp alongside him on the ballot — is difficult to know.

But following the 2020-2021 results, it looks like much less of a fluke. And it’s probably no coincidence that Republicans are beginning to fret publicly about former president Donald Trump’s past attacks on mail voting.

2. From bad to worse for Trump 2022

The runoff was but one race. But it reinforced everything we already knew about Trump and the 2022 election, which is that the former president and Trump-y candidates cost the GOP — including the Senate majority.

November had already made this evident in Georgia: Walker was the one statewide GOP candidate who didn’t win on Election Day, with the other eight winning by an average of more than seven points. (Most of the others easily turned aside Trump-backed primary challengers earlier this year.)

Walker now becomes the fourth Trump-backed candidate to lose a very winnable Senate race, next to Arizona’s Blake Masters, Nevada’s Adam Laxalt and Pennsylvania’s Mehmet Oz. Masters also performed worse than any other statewide Arizona Republican, while Laxalt lost despite a Republican winning the governor’s race. Oz did better than the GOP gubernatorial candidate but still lost a battleground state. (And that list doesn’t include New Hampshire’s Don Bolduc, whom Trump did not back in the primary but who ran a very Trump-y campaign and lost, even as Republican Gov. Chris Sununu was cruising to reelection.)

In the end, candidates Trump backed in the primary lost in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, while winning in another swing state, North Carolina. They also won in Ohio, but it was a big night for Ohio Republicans generally, and Senate candidate J.D. Vance far underperformed other Republicans.

We can’t say for certain that other, better candidates would have won more of these races. But these candidates were unpopular and cost the GOP votes — as both these election results and those in the House make clear.

And Georgia was arguably the most conclusive missed opportunity in the battle for the Senate, given how well all of these other, non-MAGA Republicans did.

In a way, the fact that Georgia held its runoff four weeks after Election Day was tailor-made to remind people of Trump’s drag on the political prospects of his party. What a time to launch your 2024 campaign.

3. What it means for the Senate

Unlike the 2020-2021 Georgia runoffs, this election didn’t decide the Senate majority. But it did assure that Democrats have a more literal majority of the chamber, 51-49, rather than their current version with 50 plus Vice President Harris as the tiebreaker.

And that matters for a few reasons, as we wrote earlier Tuesday.

The first is that it’s easier to move legislation, both because Democrats no longer need complete party unanimity (see: Sens. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona) and because they will face fewer procedural hurdles within the Senate’s various committees. One place where this could particularly matter is on confirming judges more quickly.

The second is that it ensures Democrats will keep the majority even if there is a vacancy or a party switch over the next two years, which history suggests is no small consideration.

The third is that it improves their chances in what should be a tough 2024. The map is exceedingly difficult for Democrats, with the eight most competitive seats all being ones Democrats are defending — at least to start out with. Without Georgia, they wouldn’t have been able to lose any of them; now, they’ll have at least a little bit of a buffer.

4. The full picture of the 2022 election

Now that the 2022 election is officially and finally over, it’s worth a tale of the tape.

This was more or less a status-quo election. That’s unusual for midterms, in which the president’s party usually loses substantial ground. In the end:

Democrats gained a net of one Senate seat and two governor’s mansions. While we have seen a handful of status-quo midterm elections over the past 100 years, it’s the first time since 1934 that the president’s party has managed to gain both Senate and governor’s seats in a midterm.

Republicans gained a net of nine House seats, which was enough to reclaim the House. On average, over the past century, the opposition party gained nearly 30 seats in the midterms, and it has gained 25 seats in elections since 1994.

When it comes to state legislatures, Democrats gained a net of four chambers — two in Michigan and one each in Minnesota and Pennsylvania.

Combining races for governor and state legislature, Republicans now fully control 22 states, and Democrats control 17. The split before this election was 23-14 in favor of the GOP.

All told, a close election — but a good one for Democrats on the margins and compared with the historical pattern.

336,Who is Sen. Raphael Warnock?,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Democratic Sen. Raphael G. Warnock, a passionate orator whose speeches often connect mundane D.C. policy to a higher purpose, won a full term to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday in a hard-fought runoff election in Georgia against Republican Herschel Walker. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Warnock, 53, has been on the ballot five times since he first became a candidate for Senate in 2020 to fill the final two years of the late Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson’s term. He won that race in a tight runoff election in January 2021, becoming the first Black senator from Georgia and the first Black Democratic senator from the South.

In his brief time in Washington, Warnock has risen as one of the most impactful voices in the Democratic Party. He is known as a powerful speaker who draws inspiration from iconic civil rights leaders from Georgia, such as the late Rep. John Lewis. Warnock uses his own life’s trajectory to speak about America’s promise.

Warnock was born in Savannah, and he and his 11 siblings grew up in public housing. Their mother had worked as a sharecropper, picking cotton and tobacco as a teen.

Warnock excelled academically and was the first in his family to attend college. He obtained a degree in psychology from Morehouse College, a historically Black men’s school that counts the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. among its esteemed alumni.

Warnock earned a doctorate from the Union Theological Seminary in New York, which led him to leadership positions at prominent Black churches in Birmingham, Baltimore, New York and finally, Atlanta, where he serves as head pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King famously preached during the height of the civil rights movement until his assassination in 1968.

Warnock used the pulpit to advocate for progressive issues, particularly around health care, such as expanding Medicaid. As a politician, he has continued to use soaring rhetoric to fight for voting rights and against racial and economic inequities.

Just a few weeks after he won the runoff on Jan. 5, 2021, Warnock stood on the Senate floor and implored his colleagues to support the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, legislation aimed at expanding voting access.

“We’ve been summoned here. We cannot turn away. And in just a few moments, all 100 of us, blessed with a sacred trust, will let the American people know where we stand on the question of whether the Senate will protect their voices, the voices of the very people who sent us here — or if we will simply surrender to the anti-democratic fervor and polarizing disunity spreading across our nation,” Warnock said in his floor speech. The bill died in the Senate.

Earlier this year, Warnock was at the forefront of a push to cap the high cost of insulin for Medicare enrollees. In the campaign’s closing days, Warnock highlighted that issue to contrast his record with Walker’s.

But mostly, Warnock characterized the race as a question of “character and competence,” calling Walker unfit to be a senator.

“I know we have political differences. That’s part of what makes this country a great country … but let me tell you — in my race, this isn’t about Republican and Democrat. This is not about right and left,” Warnock said last week during a rally with former president Barack Obama. “This is about the difference between right and wrong.”

While Walker had to contend with numerous high-profile scandals, Warnock also had to deal with his own personal issues during the campaign. Warnock’s ex-wife, the mother of his two young children, sued to have his child support payments “recalculated” based on his increased income since joining the Senate. During his 2020 election, she alleged that Warnock ran over her foot with a car during a dispute, though no charges were filed. A super PAC supporting Walker made an attack ad using police body-cam footage from that incident which showed Warnock’s ex calling him a “great actor.”

“I want to set the record straight: My children live with me. I am present with my children in every way that a father should be, from breakfast in the morning to bedtime prayers at night. I can’t continue to let him lie about our family,” Warnock told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a November interview, speaking about Walker.

On the trail, Warnock also sought to appeal to independent and Republican voters by touting his work across the aisle, calling himself a “practical” senator who is willing to work with anyone to deliver for Georgians. He frequently mentioned working with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on a bill addressing maternal mortality rates and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) on an amendment that targeting the planned extension of Interstate 14.

“There is a road that runs through our humanity,” he has said many times on the trail.

Georgia, a politically polarized and racially diverse state, helped secure the White House for President Biden in 2020. Warnock’s historic win that election cycle, along with fellow Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff, gave Democrats a slim 50-50 majority in the Senate, with Vice President Harris as the tiebreaking vote.

Advertisement

Going into this year’s runoff, the Democrats already have 50 seats after flipping a Republican-held seat in Pennsylvania in November. Warnock’s win gave the party a much-coveted 51st seat, which will give Democrats more power in committees; it could also make it easier for the party to pass legislation if one of its members balks, as has happened several times during the past two years.

Warnock focused his campaign on the issues important to Georgia’s voters rather than the national implications of his race.

“I can say to the people of Georgia with a straight face that after nearly two years of doing this work, as frustrating as politics can be and as cynical as our politics has become, because of the work that I’m able to get done for ordinary folks, I love this job,” Warnock said. “And I intend to make good use of the trust that the people have placed in my hands to fight for them every single day.”

337,Supreme Court to consider fundamental change in elections authority,"The Supreme Court hears oral arguments on Dec. 7 on if state legislatures can create election maps without oversight from state courts. (Video: The Washington Post)

Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Legal battles over partisan and racial gerrymandering “are as North Carolina as barbecue, tobacco fields and hot, humid summer days,” says the executive director of the state Common Cause chapter. But the case that the Supreme Court hears Wednesday brings stakes like no other. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The justices will take up what both sides agree could be a fundamental, even radical change in the way federal elections are conducted. It could give state legislatures sole authority to set the rules for the contests, subject only to intervention by Congress, even if the actions of legislators violate voter protections laid out in state constitutions and result in extreme partisan gerrymandering for congressional seats.

Advanced by North Carolina’s Republican legislative leaders, the “independent state legislature theory” could negate a governor’s veto, end the oversight of courts enforcing the state constitution and cast doubt on citizen-implemented initiatives aimed at taking partisan politics out of map-drawing and election rules.

If the argument is revolutionary, it is also simple. The leaders wrote in a brief to the court that the Constitution “assigns state legislatures the federal function of regulating congressional elections. . . . Because this directive is supreme over state law, the States may not limit the legislature’s discretion.”

But the Supreme Court has never ruled that the Constitution’s recognition that the legislature leads the process should replace the normal mechanisms of government, in which legislators are constrained by the state constitution and overseen by state courts. Part of the argument Wednesday will center on the meaning of the word “legislature” in the Founding Fathers’ minds.

The importance of the case is magnified by the nation’s polarized and disruptive political landscape, with hundreds of election-deniers seeking public office and former president Donald Trump and his allies waging lengthy battles to undermine confidence in and reverse the results of the 2020 election. Last month’s elections showed that control of Congress can depend on the manipulation of a handful of congressional district lines. Polls show record Democratic distrust of a Supreme Court dominated by justices nominated by Republicans.

A study by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice said that accepting North Carolina’s argument, which is supported by other Republican-led states, would endanger hundreds of state constitutional provisions and state court decisions and more than a thousand delegations of authority to officials, commissions and others.

And because there is a similar reference to “legislature” in an accompanying provision of the U.S. Constitution regarding presidential elections, the stakes are even higher, the center’s report said. “The nightmare scenario is that a legislature, displeased with how an election official on the ground has interpreted her state’s election laws, would invoke the theory as a pretext to refuse to certify the results of a presidential election and instead select its own slate of electors.”

Law professor John Eastman, representing Trump in post-election challenges in 2020, advanced just such a theory.

Strident warnings

Moore v. Harper challenges the North Carolina Supreme Court’s decision to replace a partisan congressional map with one judges found more in tune with the state constitution’s guarantee of free elections. It has drawn enormous and strident interest — mostly from critics warning the justices they are about to make a big mistake. Only 16 of the nearly 70 amicus briefs filed with the Supreme Court side with North Carolina’s legislative leaders.

Advertisement

The opposition includes not only includes civil rights organizations and Democratic-led states but also the chief justices of the nation’s state supreme courts; credentialed, retired Republican judges; the co-founder of the conservative Federalist Society; former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger; and Republican election lawyer Ben Ginsberg — who, in the words of the Brennan Center report, “worked in the Bush v. Gore case that planted the seeds of the theory” that forms the backbone of the challenge.

“This case is nothing less than a direct challenge to our system of checks and balances. It’s truly a fringe, fringe theory,” said Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama.

“Fringe” is a word ubiquitous in the filings. But four of the nine Supreme Court justices have already expressed interest in — if not outright support for — the state-legislature theory. Which raises the question: How much of an outlier can it be?

Advertisement

In the aftermath of the disputed 2000 presidential vote, Justice Clarence Thomas joined a concurring opinion in Bush v. Gore by then-Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist that said the Constitution’s grant of power to legislatures to oversee elections limited the power of state judges to intervene. Justice Antonin Scalia was the only other member of the court to sign on.

The doctrine comes from the U.S. Constitution’s election clause, which says that the “Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.” There is similar language regarding presidential electors.

In the past, the language has been widely interpreted as bestowing the power on states, shared by citizens and the legislative, executive and judicial branches.

But in voting disputes leading up to the 2020 presidential election, Thomas and Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh expressed varying degrees of support for the view that state courts could not usurp the role of state legislatures in prescribing rules for federal elections.

When North Carolina’s GOP leaders asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the imposition of the court-ordered congressional map, a majority of justices refused. But Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch dissented, saying the legislature seemed to have the better argument.

“If the language of the Elections Clause is taken seriously, there must be some limit on the authority of state courts to countermand actions taken by state legislatures when they are prescribing rules for the conduct of federal elections,” Alito wrote. “I think it is likely that the applicants would succeed in showing that the North Carolina Supreme Court exceeded those limits.”

Advertisement

In challenges to voting rules changed by courts, other justices expressed similar views. “The Constitution provides that state legislatures — not federal judges, not state judges, not state governors, not other state officials — bear primary responsibility for setting election rules,” Gorsuch wrote in a case from Wisconsin.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was a dissenter when the Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that Arizona citizens could place the power to redraw districts in an independent commission. He accused the majority of using a “magic trick” to impose its policy preferences by interpreting “legislature” to mean the citizens of the state.

But in 2019, when deciding partisan gerrymandering was outside of the purview of federal courts, Roberts and other conservative justices said state courts could ensure the process did not become so extreme as to impinge on the rights of voters.

“Provisions in state statutes and state constitutions can provide standards and guidance for state courts to apply,” their opinion said.

A history of gerrymandering

It is fitting that the high-stakes battle over elections authority comes from North Carolina. It is a purple state, with a legislature controlled by Republicans, a Democratic governor and attorney general and a partisan, elected state Supreme Court that in November flipped to the GOP. Trump won 50 percent of the vote in 2020, compared with 49 percent for Joe Biden.

North Carolina Common Cause Executive Director Bob Phillips said there has not been an election since 1971 in which the state’s redistricting plans have not been challenged.

“In the decade after the 2010 redistricting cycle, every single legislative and congressional election was run on maps that the courts eventually ruled unconstitutional,” he said in a briefing for reporters. “I’m not sure there are many states, if any, that can make that claim.”

Analysts said the map created by Republican legislators after the 2020 Census would have given the GOP an edge in 10 of 14 congressional districts.

Advertisement

The court, which at the time had a Democratic majority, concluded the maps “are unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt under the free elections clause, the equal protection clause, the free speech clause, and the freedom of assembly clause of the North Carolina Constitution.”

Under a new map imposed just for the 2022 election, the congressional delegation is split 7 to 7.

“It’s almost unfathomable to imagine what will be imposed on North Carolina citizens if our state courts are no longer a place where a bad congressional map can be challenged,” Phillips said.

North Carolina’s legislature set up a stem for judicial review of redistricting challenges, which could also be a factor in this case.

Lee Goodman, a former Federal Election Commission chairman who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, said the founders of the country were explicit in saying election rules were the responsibility of legislatures and not other parts of state governments.

“When the Founders assigned the responsibility of drawing rules for elections, including drawing district lines, they had to assign the role to somebody or some institution,” he said in an interview this week. “The Constitution could have assigned it to the states, but the Constitution specifically assigned the duty to the legislatures of the states — with a check by Congress.”

John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law professor, agreed that in such situations, state legislators were not governed by state constitutions.

“When the [U.S.] Constitution uses the state legislature here, it’s actually commandeering the state to perform a federal function,” he said in an interview. “It’s as if the state legislature becomes part of the federal government for that one purpose.”

He contended the same logic held in a 1995 case that found states could not impose term limits on members of Congress.

Such views are contradicted in briefs from the other side.

“Every Justice should exercise extreme caution before accepting any of Petitioners’ assertions,” says a brief by legal scholars (and brothers) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram David Amar along with Steven Calabresi, one of the co-founders of the Federalist Society. “Their brief is littered with major misstatements and half-truths.”

The scholars argue that the public meaning of “legislature” was clear “at the time of ratification: A state’s ‘legislature’ was not just something created to make laws on behalf of the people; it was something created and constrained by the state constitution.”

They add, “This basic starting point — that state legislatures were creatures of state constitutions, creatures whose very existence and shape derived from state constitutions — suffices to defeat” the independent state legislature theory.

Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Jim Manion, the leader of bodybuilding’s top federations, assured promoters who pay fees to host bodybuilding competitions that business would proceed as usual in the aftermath of a Washington Post investigation into the sexual exploitation of female contestants. Tuesday’s story in The Post was based on interviews with 20 women who detailed their experiences with J.M. Manion, Jim Manion’s son and the official photographer for the NPC News Online website, including some who said J.M. Manion encouraged them to pose nude. Over a 15-year span, J.M. Manion operated a network of paid soft-core pornography websites that at one point advertised “over 30,000 images” of competitors in the sport, according to archived versions of the websites.

“Rest assured, this will not affect our organizations at all going forward,” the Manions wrote in an email sent to competition promoters from an NPC account and signed by Jim Manion and his grandson, Tyler Manion, vice president of the two Pittsburgh-based federations, the amateur National Physique Committee and the IFBB Pro League. The email, obtained by The Post, said the articles were “unsubstantiated tales from unreliable sources” seeking to discredit the organization.

But organizations that sponsor or host events with the NPC/IFBB Pro said they are taking their own steps to protect athletes.

Brian Powers, executive director for the Arnold Sports Festival, which includes the Arnold Classic, said his organization has a zero-tolerance policy, and in light of recent reports, “we are developing enhanced measures to strengthen existing safety protocols.”

Another official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak on the record, said: “J.M. Manion will not be attending our show.”

In an email to The Post, the Olympia organization, which will hold its premier annual event in December, said it would address “any and all issues that could impact the culture and the integrity of the sport we love. We will continue to update you on these efforts in the weeks to come.”

Two prominent promoters who have put on bodybuilding shows over many years for Manion’s organizations spoke out this week about The Post’s reporting.

L. Brent Jones, who has run shows in Kentucky since 2002, sent a mass email with the subject line, “Why I resigned from the NPC and the IFBB Pro League,” saying that he resigned Oct. 17, a week before The Post published its investigation, over many of the issues covered in the story. “My reasons are simple,” he wrote in a mass email Thursday. “I am tired of the increased sexualization of the sport and the corruption.”

Approached during a show outside of Baltimore on Saturday, promoter Rich Siegelman called the allegations “disturbing” and said he had spoken to J.M. Manion, who was scheduled to be the photographer of the event, and that they had agreed that he would not come.

“These are some serious accusations and allegations, and they need to be taken seriously,” Siegelman said.

A Post review of archives of J.M. Manion’s soft-core pornography sites identified more than 200 female athletes in photos ranging from bikini shots to graphic sexual images, including those of nude women together in beds, bathtubs and showers.

The Manions’ bodybuilding empire lacks any oversight structure and athletes say there is no formal process to report misconduct against top officials, coaches, photographers, promoters or others involved in the sport, leaving them vulnerable to abuses.

“Imagine if Team USA women’s golf decided to operate a soft-porn website featuring its athletes? People would be outraged,” said John Manly, the lawyer who represented more than 180 women in a lawsuit against USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee.

“It’s really like Playboy decided to oversee a sport while at the same time using athletes for pornography,” added Manly, who won a $380 million settlement for athletes who were sexually abused by former Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar.

The National Organization for Women, the nation’s largest women’s advocacy group, called on prosecutors to open an investigation.

“Bring wrongdoers to court, and make them pay,” said Christian F. Nunes, the president of NOW. “They are not even publicly acknowledging the experiences of these women.”

In a statement to The Post before publication of Tuesday’s story, Manion said he “addresses all concerns raised with the utmost care, concern, and timeliness.”

On Friday, Manion’s lawyer responded to The Post’s story with a two-page memo titled “Defamatory Articles Involving the IFBB Professional League, the National Physique Committee, and Jim Manion.”

The letter states some sources cited in The Post’s story “possess a clear animus against my clients due to many prior disputes between the parties and/or the fact they are directly competing or seeking to directly compete against the NPC and/or IFBB Pro League,” wrote Brian H. Simmons, a Pittsburgh attorney with the firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney.

Simmons added that his clients “emphatically deny any and all wrongdoing.”

The Manions’ response comes in stark contrast to how leading sports organizations deal with allegations of sexual harassment.

“The Manions have had the exact opposite response to all these other sports organizations that have been found out,” said Nancy Hogshead-Makar, an Olympic gold medalist swimmer and a lawyer who runs Champion Women, a group that advocates for girls and women in sports.

“I would expect the response would be: ‘Let’s have an investigation and stop this,’ ” she said. “They are going to continue to abuse women, and they have telegraphed that by the lack of concern they are showing.”

Manly, the lawyer who represented the gymnasts, said the women have few legal protections because they are not participating in a regulated sport entity, like an Olympic sport that falls under the Ted Stevens Act. The law requires the governing bodies of amateur Olympic sports to report any suspected sexual abuse and sexual misconduct.

Barbara Osborne, professor of sports law at the University of North Carolina Law School, said that many athletes in professional American sports are employees of the organizations they compete under, giving them Title VII protections against workplace discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion and national origin. Many professional athletes are unionized, giving them further rights and protections.

340,The pandemic made work holiday parties weird. How to navigate yours.,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The holiday season is here, and you’re probably planning family get-togethers, doing some gift shopping and maybe preparing for some time off from work. But should your plans include attending your company’s holiday party, given that we’re still in a pandemic? Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight Many workers are wondering if work culture shifts caused by the pandemic have impacted what’s expected at holiday work parties. Are you required to attend? Exactly how long is long enough? Is it okay to arrive late? Does any of this change if the party is virtual? Does being a fully remote, hybrid or full-time office worker create different dynamics? What about masking?

For younger employees who entered the workforce during the pandemic, this is the first time they’re getting invited to a company party. Others have become accustomed to working from home either part- or full-time and may run their schedule differently than they did before. Some office workers have returned to pre-pandemic norms, heading to the office five days a week. And at some companies, all three types of workers exist in the same organization.

“We’re between worlds right now,” says Jeff Schwartz, senior adviser for Deloitte’s Future of Work program and vice president at talent marketplace Gloat. “And we’re still trying to actively figure out how to manage in this transition.”

So what does that mean for your holiday work party?

Here’s what workplace experts advise when it comes to attending your company’s holiday party.

In general, holiday parties should be considered just that — social occasions allowing you to mix with supervisors and colleagues, work aside, experts said. While much about the workplace may have changed during the pandemic, the concept of a holiday party is still relatively the same, they said. But there are some new nuances at play that may affect your decisions surrounding the party.

There are several things you may want to consider in determining whether to attend the workplace party, how long you plan to stay if you do go and how you might handle a virtual party. The good news? Several experts say the pandemic highlighted the importance — and possible challenges — of people’s lives outside work. In turn, in many cases that has resulted in bosses who may have a greater understanding that you may be preoccupied with other responsibilities.

“We’re learning how to do things again,” says Jill Gugino Pante, director of the University of Delaware’s Lerner Career Services Center. “But also, we’re a little bit more laid-back and a little more understanding of people.”

When determining whether to attend an optional holiday work party, ask yourself what value you expect to get out of the event, says Sophie Theen, a human resources consultant. Workers might see value in simply getting face time with their colleagues, having a chance to socialize or creating better bonds.

“But if you’re in a position where you just don’t feel like it will add any value, then feel free to decline,” she said.

Remote or hybrid workers might get more value out of holiday parties as they may not get to mingle as much with their colleagues in-person. This might even be the first chance those workers get to casually socialize.

“Familiarity breeds trust,” Pante said. “So that [working] relationship is probably going to get better.”

Many work experts say don’t feel pressured to attend an optional party. If you choose not to go, you should politely let your manager know versus silently being absent. This helps people know what to expect and could mitigate bad assumptions about why you’re missing.

If the party is mandatory, or there’s an unspoken expectation you attend, but you’re still feeling uneasy, go with a plan in mind, says Brenda Ellington Booth, executive coach and professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. That may involve wearing a mask, Pante said. Ellington Booth said it could mean carpooling with a colleague or if you haven’t met anyone in-person before, messaging a familiar co-worker and planning to arrive at the party at the same time, for example.

Arriving fashionably late might also ease potential awkwardness as more people will be at the party before you arrive. But unlike a friend’s party, you most likely won’t want to be more than 20 or 30 minutes late to a company party and even less so if it’s a virtual event, dinner or activity-based party in which people may be waiting on your arrival, Ellington Booth said.

Making too short of an appearance at a company holiday party may not be the best look, experts agree. So if you attend, be prepared to spend more than half-an-hour at the event. You also may want to understand what the event entails ahead of time. Is it a dinner, where it might be awkward to leave during the second course? Will you be on teams and playing games? Will your boss or CEO make a speech?

“There’s an expectation you be there for the duration that has an agenda,” Schwartz says.

But virtual events tend to allow for a different approach, Schwartz notes. Workers have become accustomed to saying at the start of the meeting, whether it be by voice or chat, that they can only stay for a certain amount of time due to other commitments. If a virtual holiday party includes activities, Schwartz suggested workers take the same approach and mention early on.

After all considerations, if you’re unsure about what’s expected of you, a safe bet is to ask your trusted colleagues or manager if you’re comfortable, Pante says. And Ellington Booth says it’s also good to set your intentions before you go to a holiday party. Are there people you want to make sure you get face time with? How do you want to be perceived?

Schwartz says if you end up on the fence about whether to attend, take the plunge and go. More than likely the people attending are hoping to connect with colleagues they may not meet in the normal course of business.

“You might even have a good time,” he said, laughing. “But no guarantees.”

341,Is it okay to give cash to teachers and day-care workers at the holidays?,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Q: Do you have opinions on what gifts are best for teachers and day-care workers? Is cash appropriate? If so, how much? A: Do I have opinions? Friend, you’ve come to the right place. Thank you for offering one of the easiest questions that has ever been asked in my almost 10 years of writing the column.

“Is cash appropriate?” YES. Yes. And yes.

When it comes to anyone who works with or near children, cash is appropriate. Why? Because they are grossly underpaid. In many cases, day-care workers are paid less than someone serving coffee at Dunkin’. And while public school teachers fare better in pay, the pandemic and our political climate have resulted in a teacher shortage. Public school teachers are, largely, overworked, threatened with violence and managing issues that they aren’t meant to handle, and still spend up to $500 of their own money for basic supplies (sometimes more).

So yes, cash works.

How much you give is personal. It could be based, for example, on your experience with the teachers or your income.

You should, of course, be sure that your district or day care doesn’t have any strict rules around cash as gifts. Next, make sure that your school or class hasn’t already created a group gift collection. If they haven’t, companies like Cheddar Up make it easy to collect from parents. (This is usually the role of the class parent.) You aren’t obligated to do a group gift; you can purchase your own gift cards to Amazon, Target or other companies that people frequently use.

And as a former teacher, I truly did appreciate every mug, homemade cookie and bath salt, but the gifts I cherished the most were notes from students and parents. A heartfelt and short note is balm to a weary teacher’s soul and, when paired with a gift card, makes for a lovely gift.

I would recommend having your child write thank yous (or have them dictate if they aren’t writing yet) for their teachers, and art works, too. By having our children, of all ages, write something short and specific, (“Thank you for letting me turn in my homework late,” or “Thank you for taking us to the zoo, I loved the elephants,”) reminds teachers how much they matter. I would make it fun; get some hot chocolate, put on your favorite holiday music, get or make some cards, have some good pens and have a little “thank you” session in your family. Your children may eye-roll or sigh, but it’s worth it to try, and the parents have to participate by writing notes to their important people, too, like trash collectors and mail carriers.

Look at that — everyone wins, and you parent your kids in a way that teaches them empathy, kindness and appreciation.

Good luck and happy holidays!

344,Herschel Walker was a Georgia football hero. Then he ran for Senate. - The Washington Post,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Herschel Walker could be basking in his former glory, his many offenses against women, children, honesty and the English language neatly masked by the invisibility cloak of celebrity. He is, after all, a walking personification of University of Georgia football, and Georgia is flying high: undefeated and ranked No. 1. Every great season stirs memories of past triumphs, and Walker is — or was, anyway — triumph personified.

In three seasons before turning pro after his junior year, the powerful running back scored 52 touchdowns, rushed for more than 5,000 yards and won 33 games against just three losses. He won the 1982 Heisman Trophy by a mile over a Stanford University quarterback named John Elway. Walker was the marquee player of the short-lived U.S. Football League, then entered the National Football League, where he racked up 61 touchdowns.

Perhaps, to borrow a phrase, he got tired of winning, because today he is known for his humiliating campaign for U.S. Senate from Georgia. The debacle — which featured allegations of his abandoned children, terrorized mates, brandished firearms, fictionalized achievements and secret funding of girlfriends’ abortions — ended on Tuesday with Walker’s opponent, Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D), reelected in a runoff.

Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker on Dec. 6 said his campaign was the “best thing” he had done after losing to Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-Ga.). (Video: The Washington Post)

It’s one thing for a deeply flawed person to accept admiration for his former athletic magnificence, but it’s quite another for him to seek a role in leading the country. The dirty laundry that Walker kept stuffed into the vault behind his trophy case was hauled into the glare of television lights and packaged into millions of dollars of negative advertising. One of Walker’s sons summed up his famous father this way: He “left us to bang a bunch of women, threatened to kill us, and had us move over 6 times in 6 months” to escape the mayhem of his own making.

No tackler could trip him up but, on the campaign trail, Walker struggled to break free of the grip of simple sentences. In the last days of the race, Warnock bought TV time to play Walker’s most baffling statements over and over. It is a bad sign in politics when your opponent starts paying to broadcast your words.

Georgia’s Republican lieutenant governor was pithy in assessing Walker’s political career: “one of the worst candidates in our party’s history.”

Follow David Von Drehle 's opinions Follow

What compels a person to shower in gasoline and light up a cigar? In Walker’s case, it is a familiar story. He came into the orbit of that serial destroyer of other people’s reputations, Donald Trump.

The two men bonded after Trump acquired the New Jersey Generals of the USFL in 1983. Walker was the Generals’ superstar; luring him away from college the previous year had been a coup for the upstart league. Trump believed that Walker’s on-field prowess could help him force a merger with the established NFL.

Instead, like many of Trump’s enterprises, the league went bust. The mogul and his athletic marvel split on friendly terms after the 1985 season, the USFL’s last, during which Walker gained an incredible 2,411 yards. Despite going their separate ways — Walker to the NFL, Trump to the money pit of Atlantic City — they remained friendly. And we all know what becomes of Trump’s friends.

And so on.

By encouraging Walker to run for the Senate and endorsing him in the Republican primary, Trump reminded the world of his contempt for American government and American ideals. One hot mess is as good as the next when it comes to burning down the GOP and replacing it with a cult of Trump. As usual, voters disagreed and rejected Walker — just as they rejected Trump’s unready candidates in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona in November.

A true friend would have told Walker: Keep your head down and stay out of politics. People love you as a football icon, but running for office is a whole new ballgame. It doesn’t matter how fast you are; you can’t outrun opposition research. You have no blockers to protect you from yourself.

345,Warnock’s win exposes the new geography of GOP weakness - The Washington Post,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

It’s easy to forget this now but, before 2020, there was widespread skepticism that Democrats could transform Georgia into a competitive state. Joe Biden’s presidential campaign invested resources there and won by a scant 11,000 votes, after which Democrats won both the state’s U.S. Senate seats, also by very tight margins.

Now that Sen. Raphael G. Warnock has been reelected in the Georgia runoff, Democrats will for the foreseeable future treat this state not just as competitive but as essential to their national strategy.

Warnock’s victory should be seen as part of a larger shift, in which Democrats are reconfiguring their national map — with regard to both the Senate and the White House — through gains in the New South and the Southwest. In two straight cycles — 2020 and 2022 — Democrats ran the table in key states in those regions for the first time in decades.

Advertisement

To understand this ongoing shift, I talked to Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg, who presciently predicted that the vaunted “red wave” of 2022 would not materialize. (Full disclosure: Rosenberg is a friend.) This interview has been edited for clarity and condensed.

Follow Greg Sargent 's opinions Follow

Greg Sargent: In 2020 and 2022, Democrats won Georgia, Virginia, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, while as recently as 2004 Republicans won them all. Do you view this as a meaningful shift in our politics?

Simon Rosenberg: The high-water mark for the Republican Party in the last generation was the 2004 election. Since then, those six states have gone from Republican to Democrat. The gains that Democrats made in the New South and the Southwest since George W. Bush’s time have built a new and modern electoral coalition for us.

Advertisement

As recently as 2020, there was debate over whether Biden should invest resources in Georgia. Biden won it. With Warnock, we have confirmation that this wasn’t just a one-off.

Our track record of winning runoffs in Georgia was abysmal. Now, we’ve done it in 2020 and 2022, with the guy pulling off two wins being an African American preacher. Georgia has become a state where we’ve learned how to win statewide. We’ve learned how to win in Arizona. It’s changed the map.

Let’s talk about Arizona. Biden won there by a hair in 2020, but then Sen. Mark Kelly won it by five points in 2022. What does that tell us?

A similar story happened in Arizona and Georgia. These states had demographic possibilities for us. We changed the electorates in them through voter registration and voter turnout. In Georgia, it was led by Stacey Abrams, and in Arizona, it was a team effort.

Advertisement

Now, not only have we won both states at the presidential level, but we’ve also picked up four Senate seats in them.

The fact that Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto could hang on in Nevada, while Sen. Michael F. Bennet won a lopsided victory in Colorado — both amid difficult conditions for Democrats — cements the idea that there’s been a real shift in the Southwest.

The story in the Southwest is ongoing Republican erosion. We get very large margins among Hispanic voters. And as Hispanic voters have increased their share in many of these states, they’re continuing to become more Democratic, the way it happened in California. If Republicans can’t do better with Hispanic voters, this region is going to slip away from them.

There has been a shift among Latinos toward Republicans here and there. How seriously do you take that as a long-term thing Democrats have to pay attention to?

Advertisement

While there was a dip in 2020 and we don’t yet know what happened in 2022, we’re going to need to be more agile and stop treating the Hispanic vote as monolithic. What’s happening in Florida is very different from what’s happening in the Southwest. Even in 2022 when there was a dip, Democrats had their best year in the Southwest in 80 years.

Colorado and New Mexico are on the verge of becoming one-party states, like California. Arizona is more Democratic. There’s no question as you look ahead to 2024, Nevada will be one of the true battlegrounds. But it’s not clear that Colorado and New Mexico will be competitive.

You brought up Florida. One could argue that the shift in the Southwest and the New South is mainly offsetting the deepening Republican advantage in places like Florida, Ohio and Iowa.

Advertisement

The point you make is valid. Republicans have seen improvements in their marginal battleground states, ones that Democrats had hoped to win. Iowa is obviously seen as so far gone that Democrats were willing to let go of the Iowa caucuses.

To what degree was the shift in the Southwest and the New South toward Democrats accelerated by Donald Trump?

MAGA has performed terribly in the battlegrounds in three consecutive elections. You now have this kind of muscle memory for voters in these states, where they identify the Republican Party as MAGA, because MAGA continues to be the offering put in front of them.

Whoever the nominee is in 2024 — even if it isn’t Trump — will have a hard time saying, “No, I’m not really MAGA, I’m this other kind of Republican.""

I think [Florida Gov.] Ron DeSantis made an enormous strategic error by running so hard toward MAGA over the last year. It’s going to be very difficult — now that MAGA is seen as a failure — for him to somehow claim that this isn’t his governing approach.

On the other hand, DeSantis put together a true majority coalition in an admittedly red-leaning state, but not that red-leaning a state.

What’s happening in Florida is unique. When DeSantis goes out into these battleground states, the politics are going to be very different there. He’s deeply out of position on abortion.

I remain very optimistic. Democrats are going to try really hard to put North Carolina into the mix. You’ll see efforts in North Carolina that feel similar to what we did in Arizona and Georgia.

The core battlegrounds are going to be Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. We’re going to see a very different kind of map. When I look to 2024, I’d rather be us than them.

346,Your 2022 Christmas gift guide to the GSA auction website - The Washington Post,"Opinion (Washington Post staff illustration; iStock, GSA)

Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

According to the General Services Administration, “the US Federal Government owns and disposes of more property than any other entity in the world.” I know what you’re thinking: Wow! If only I could get my hands on it, that would solve all my Christmas shopping needs! Well, fortunately for you, the General Services Administration has an auction website where you can buy all those things the government has “purchased, used, and no longer needs,” from “Fire Trucks and Fire Fighting Equipment” to “Artifacts, Jewelry and Exotic Collectibles” and everything in between (“Miscellaneous”)!

Unfortunately the categories of “Lighthouses” and “NASA Shuttle/Hubble” did not have any listings this year. But all of the items in the following gift guide were for sale when I checked last week; some may have been auctioned off and their listings taken down, but if you hurry, you can still find a winner!

Cafeteria furnishing package

For the person who is always saying, “I love my home, but I always wish it looked a little bit more like a Department of Veterans Affairs cafeteria” — now, you can finally get that look you’ve been craving! Brace yourself for compliments from all the people who will notice your comely, colorful chairs, your efficient, stackable tables, and three disposal bins with little hands on them. All you need is the trays! A wonderful surprise for anyone in your life who was expecting (reasonably) literally anything else. Radiological pocket dosimeter For the dad who has everything! This used radiological pocket dosimeter will possibly require repairs, as parts might be missing or damaged. This means it combines the excitement of a radiological pocket dosimeter with the excitement of a fixer-upper! Your recipient will look at this gift and say, “Not great, not terrible.” Office chairs, TV cabinet and faux trees Always wanted to know where you could get a tree that looked like it was fake, but also like it was dying? Now you know! And it’s just $20! As part of a bundle, no less! I cannot stress enough that, although these chairs, TV cabinet and fake trees look inexpensive, they look more expensive than their asking price of $20. Give this to someone who wants to appear to be letting a plant slowly and miserably die without the guilt of actually doing so. Various medical material I will be honest, what I like best about this auction lot is the presentation: a set of boxes wrapped up in plastic with a sign taped on them that says “EXCESS” in a font reminiscent of Comic Sans. It contains sleep masks and sock aids, so you could try to pass it off as a spa package. Laser Who doesn’t want a laser, descriptively labeled “Laser,” with the following additional information: “condition not warranted”? For the person in your life you trust with a laser. To purchase this, you will have to do a lot of ominous-sounding paperwork. 2009 Dodge RAM 3500 (wrecked)

All of those people in car commercials look so happy! Well, just think of the look in your recipient’s eyes when you say, “I got you a Dodge RAM 3500 … from 2009 … that is wrecked … at a GSA auction!” Be sure to say it in that order! The perfect stocking-stuffer, if it is wrecked enough!

Various lengths of wire

I like a straightforward gift, and nothing could be more straightforward than these various lengths of wire. How often have you been sitting around the house, wishing you could build a chicken coop in the most labor-intensive way possible, or knit yourself a small fence, but you did not have the requisite various lengths of wire? This feels like a good gift for your grandpa who is always saying things like, “In my day, we could keep ourselves occupied for months with just a pocket dosimeter and various lengths of wire.”

Flatware: Regular tablespoon

There is something in the fact that the tablespoon has felt compelled to protest this much in its listing — “Yep, just a regular tablespoon!” — that rings alarm bells for me. It did not need to insist that it was just a “regular tablespoon.” It could have said “tablespoon” and I would not have been instantly suspicious. I had no such questions about the soup spoon or the knife or the fork or even the laser, but the fact that this one is labeled “regular tablespoon” is sending me down a rabbit-hole of conspiracy. Just say tablespoon! Why can’t you?

Actually, do not buy this, because I am going to do so myself to find out the truth. “Approximately 35 pieces that include regular tablespoon,” the listing says, making me even more certain I have found a conspiracy. These have been used at U.S. embassies around the world, the listing says! I’m sure they HAVE! Anyway, if I get taken away by the CIA, you will know why.

Photo signed “Best Wishes, USAF Thunderbirds”

This framed and signed photograph of some planes flying by what appears to be Mount Rushmore is a great gift for that someone you know who has actual, specific interests but you have forgotten what they are. It is so specific that it is bound to make the recipient question whether it is, in fact, one of their interests. “They wouldn’t just give me this signed photograph of the Thunderbirds if they didn’t think I was connected to or interested in the Thunderbirds in some way,” the recipient will think, starting to sweat and panic. “Maybe I am interested in the Thunderbirds! Maybe I said something!” Four miscellaneous items Some people are easy to buy gifts for. For everyone else, there’s … this lot of four miscellaneous items! They really are very miscellaneous: some sheets, two sweaters and a shirt that says Rensselaer Polytechnic on it! If you want a gift that says “I didn’t know what to get you, and I panicked,” but are too proud to buy a gift card, this is your best bet. Seven gift cards Well, if all else fails, you can also get “(1) lot of (7) gift cards.” They’re not to GSAAuctions.gov, but they are Visa — and they’re currently selling for several hundred dollars under face value! You will, however, have to factor in traveling to pick them up from Springfield, Va. But at the end of the day, they’re also the one (7) item(s) that will make it appear you shopped literally anywhere besides the General Services Administration auction this holiday!

347,Opinion | Why the announcement on France’s baguettes is as laughable as it is laudable,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Robert Zaretsky teaches at the University of Houston. His new book is “Victories Never Last: Reading and Caregiving in a Time of Plague.” France is on a roll. A cylindrical roll, to be precise. Weeks after French novelist Annie Ernaux earned the Nobel Prize for literature, the French baguette has bagged UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage prize. Along with Indian yoga, Irish hurling and Iranian oud playing, baguette-making has now been consecrated as a tradition “inherited from our ancestors and passed on to our descendants” that maintains “cultural diversity in the face of growing globalization.”

Sadly, UNESCO’s announcement is as laughable as it is laudable.

Advertisement

UNESCO lists the several and subtle stages of baguette preparation and the few and simple ingredients it requires: “flour, water, salt and leaven and/or yeast.” These guarantee that every baguette is “unique” and results in “a specific sensory experience.”

Yet this description falls short. A real baguette is not made, as UNESCO claims, with either yeast or the sourdough starter called levain. When it comes to an authentic baguette — known as a baguette de tradition — there is no either/or: it is made only with levain. That version of the bread requires more time, patience and skill from the baker (as well as more, well, dough from the customer).

The vast majority of those 6 billion baguettes are baguettes de pain, which have more in common with the Big Mac — or, for that matter, the putative “French baguette” in your local supermarket — than with the baguette de tradition. This is an odd situation for a nation that, for centuries, has used the quality and quantity of bread as the measure of its social, political and economic well-being — where revolutions have been the stuff of flour (or the lack of it).

Advertisement

Consider Marcel Pagnol’s classic 1938 film “La femme du boulanger” (“The Baker’s Wife”). Village life comes to a standstill when the baker, played by the incomparable Raimu, starts drinking and stops baking upon learning that his younger wife has run off with a shepherd. Mobilized by the local priest, who is shocked — shocked! — to find that there is no bread to bless, the villagers search for the errant wife and persuade her to return to her husband. The film ends, predictably but tellingly, when the reunited couple fire up the oven to prepare the next day’s baguettes.

Funnily enough, it took an American, the brilliant historian Steven Kaplan, to open France’s eyes to its vexed relationship to bread. As Kaplan rightly notes in his book “Good Bread Is Back,” bread has not been only the center of material concerns in France, but its symbolic weight has long “distinguished it from all other goods, including absolute essentials.”

Intimidated by the specter of Americanization, most French bakers raised the tattered white flag of surrender and lowered the doughy white flag of artisanal standards. Lionel Poilâne, the grand resistant of traditional baking, called these bakers “reverse alchemists.” They transformed le bon pain into le faux pain — mass-produced facsimiles that are to real bread what a tour of Paris’s sewer museum is to Jean Valjean’s tour of the sewers in “Les Misérables.”

Advertisement

Moreover, Poilâne had crusty words for the baguette, inveighing against his corporation’s “baguettocentrism.” This obsession encouraged the use of frozen dough and industrial ovens, turning the crusty and golden wonder into a rubbery and pallid blunder. Even French President Emmanuel Macron has collaborated with this misrepresentation. In a tweet praising the baguette as “250 grams of magic and perfection in our daily lives,” Macron included Willy Ronis’s iconic photo of a boy, with a baguette under his arm, running down a street in Paris. But the photo dates from 1952, the very nadir of industrialized French baking in the 20th century — suggesting that the baguette was as tasteless as the photo is timeless.

In an interview with Le Monde, Kaplan praised the efforts of artisan boulangers and boulangères, whose shops, aided by state regulation, carry the official imprimatur “Boulanger, c’est un metier” (“Baker: it is a profession”). But he also warned that the battle, far from won, was hobbled by the UNESCO announcement.

Just like authentic bread, authentic traditions require authentic ingredients. Change just one and it changes everything, from the texture of the bread to the texture of the past.

348,"Opinion | Kanye West, Elon Musk and the problem with public shaming","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

There was a time not so long ago when if you wanted to hear the world’s dumbest sentiments on race or ethnicity, you had to at least put on a coat and go down to the neighborhood bar. What we did not do back then, by the way, was storm into those bars, haul out the loudest blowhards and publicly shame them at the top of every homepage and cable show in America.

That’s pretty much where we are now, when displays of basic idiocy dominate the headlines, mostly because denouncing them makes the rest of us feel more virtuous, or maybe because they seem to validate our sense that the culture is unraveling.

Exhibit A involves Ye, who used to be a big-time rapper named Kanye West but is now the society’s best-known Hitler admirer.

Then we have the international flare-up over the British Baroness Susan Hussey, who I had thought was just a character in “The Crown,” but who turns out to be the all-too-real kind of White person who thinks that non-White people must be from somewhere else.

Advertisement

And both of these incidents battled for attention with the ongoing uproar over Twitter, where the New York Times reported that slurs against Black Americans and gay men have risen sharply since Elon Musk took over the company and relaxed its moderation standards.

Follow Matt Bai 's opinions Follow

Just to be kindergarten-level clear about this, because these days you have to be: I do not condone any of these behaviors. In each instance, I find them appalling.

But it’s also true that each of these controversies, lumped together as damning evidence of the rising hate in our public discourse, are inflated beyond all proportion.

Ye (do I really have to call him that?) is pretty clearly struggling with mental illness, as his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, has been telling us for years. I’m sure there is a whole list of ways to know whether you’re suffering from serious delusion, but when you make Alex Jones look like the reasonable party in a conversation, you can probably skip the rest of it.

Advertisement

Is the moral thing here really to give Ye more of a platform to debase himself than he already has? Just because Donald Trump takes Ye seriously doesn’t mean the rest of us have to.

Lady Hussey is 83, born in the waning days of the British Empire. Show of hands: How many of you have grandparents who would say something racially insensitive without being cognizant of why?

That Hussey was clearly rude and insistent about it probably justifies the way she was immediately cast out of the castle — a punishment that might also hint at the Crown’s defensiveness in this new, post-Elizabethan era. But I think we can all agree that she wasn’t trying to ignite a transcontinental race war.

As for the growing alarm over Twitter, let’s just grasp for a modicum of context. According to the Times, slurs against Black Americans have lately risen from 1,282 a day to more like 3,876. Insults of gay men are up to a daily average of almost 4,000.

Advertisement

Thousands of slurs are thousands too many, but consider that Twitter has something like 41 million daily active users in the United States alone. We’re not talking about a remotely significant percentage of tweets, and we don’t know whether they come from users who have any actual followers. I’m reminded of a line from a clever insurance commercial I saw recently: “This is going to get tens and tens of views!”

Bigotry ought to be condemned even if it’s not especially pervasive — we should all be able to agree on that. Even as something close to a free speech absolutist, I can accept that some speech ought not to be tolerated, namely in cases where it’s intended to misinform or harm people.

But the total lack of perspective in the conversation about hate speech — this impression that somehow these controversies are the most important things happening in the universe right now — can lead us down a couple of perilous paths.

Advertisement

First, it lends credence and momentum to those on the left who would jettison the concept of free speech entirely. There’s a popular — and very misguided — argument among leftists, particularly younger ones, that free expression is a weapon wielded by the capitalist and colonialist elite, and that no one should enjoy the right to make others uncomfortable because of their race or identity. They would turn the entire country into a college campus.

Real liberals know that the freedom of speech includes the right to be stupid, hurtful and wrong. In fact, that’s generally when it matters most. We’re a stronger and more admired country not when we protect the ideas everybody loves, but when we tolerate the ones that make us sick. To argue otherwise is plainly un-American, and it’s antithetical to an enlightened society.

Second, all this mindless amplification of run-of-the-mill bigotry adds to the perception that history is moving in the wrong direction when it comes to inclusivity and tolerance. That’s just not true.

Advertisement

I’ve used this metaphor before, but I think it’s apt. When you’re riding on a train, and another train suddenly blazes past you, it creates the sensory illusion that you are moving backward, when really you’re forging steadily ahead the whole time.

Our culture is like that, too. Ugly strains of hatred have become louder and more visible since the onset of the Trump era, but that doesn’t mean we’re going backward. In fact, by any obvious measure of progress, we are a vastly more enlightened society than we were 50 years ago, or even 25 years ago.

The shouts and slurs you hear online aren’t the sounds of an ascendant ideology, but rather the shrill echoes of a dying one. Which is why Trump, despite having lucked into the presidency without winning the 2016 popular vote, has now led his party to rejection in three successive elections.

Advertisement

If you want to worry about the state of civil society, then worry about Trump’s call this week to suspend the Constitution so he can be enshrined in power — and the deafening Republican silence that followed it. Or worry about the case that just reached the Supreme Court, in which a Colorado website designer says she shouldn’t have to make wedding pages for gay couples.

But let’s all spend less time obsessing over the ramblings of an imbalanced rap artist, or the tweets of a few thousand nobodies, or the clueless clucking of some cosseted old woman halfway across the world.

They’re really no different from that guy in the bar. And we’re no better for having flogged them in the street.

349,Opinion | Republicans should be willing to make a deal on immigration,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Reports on Monday that a bipartisan immigration deal might be in the works were predictably scorned by some on the right. They seem to have forgotten something Ronald Reagan often said: Compromise is good. Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates ArrowRight Ideologues typically prefer the perfect over the possible. Reagan had to contend with that attitude frequently. Conservatives often condemned his deals, from the tax hikes he signed as governor to his 1987 arms control treaty with the Soviet Union.

Reagan’s attitude was different. As I noted in my biography of the Gipper, his leadership skills drew from his time as the lead negotiator for movie actors in their dealings with powerful studio heads. He often said that he went into those bargaining sessions knowing he couldn’t get everything he wanted, but he could get a lot if he was willing to strike a deal. He also understood he could go back in future sessions for more.

The immigration deal currently on the table would certainly give conservatives some significant provisions, though it is still far too early to say whether either side would have enough votes to pass it. The deal would reportedly extend the Trump administration’s Title 42 program, which allowed border officials to expel certain categories of migrants who cross the border illegally to prevent the spread of covid-19. It would create new processing centers for those who are admitted into the country and provide more resources to quickly adjudicate asylum claims and remove those whose claims are denied. And it would include a significant increase in funding for border enforcement, as much as $25 billion.

Follow Henry Olsen 's opinions Follow

There’s always a catch in compromises, and for conservatives that’s the progressives’ main ask: a pathway to citizenship for the “dreamers.” These people include those who were brought to the United States when they were children and are now living here illegally. Their plight garners sympathy from many Americans, including some who generally oppose illegal immigration, because they had no say in coming here. They are thus stuck between a country they know but where they have no legal status and one where they can legally reside in but do not consider their home.

The proposed deal has elements each side wants and deplores. But that’s a feature, not a bug, of deals. Compromise involves discovering the most important elements of an issue to each side and then ensuring they both secure significant wins on those fronts. That’s true whether the setting is a negotiation between spouses or between warring nations.

Advertisement

Conservatives should ask themselves what they really want in immigration policy and how much they are willing to give to get some of it. There’s no denying that the country is facing a crisis on the southern border. Overworked Border Patrol officers are encountering more than 200,000 people a month. More than 1.1 million of these individuals were admitted into the country last year as their asylum cases are adjudicated, and trends suggest that number will be much larger this year unless something is done. With President Biden in the White House and Democrats in control of the Senate, there is no chance purists can enact their preferred solutions any time soon.

This doesn’t mean conservatives should take the deal. It might be that the provisions on offer aren’t enough to solve the crisis. And the price — the potential addition of about 2 million dreamers as citizens — might be too high for many on the right. But they should look at the negotiations in those terms rather than the “all or nothing” approach too many advocate.

Taking this deal now would not preclude pushing for a better deal after the 2024 elections. For all the caterwauling over the midterms, Republicans did win the national popular vote for the House. And even if their 2024 nominee does no better than the party did this year, Republicans won either a contested statewide race, the House vote or both in enough states to secure the White House. Plus, Democrats will need to defend seven seats in the Senate in 2024 that Donald Trump carried at least once, meaning the GOP could be in position two years from now to improve any deal they make.

Advertisement

But even that best-case scenario, Republicans would still need some Democratic buy-in because of the filibuster in the Senate. Hard-liners should factor that into their calculations and ask themselves whether making a deal today would increase the chances of cooperation tomorrow.

Cutting deals likely doesn’t satisfy anyone’s romantic notions of politics. Nevertheless, it is a necessary fact of politics, and conservatives should channel their inner Reagan as they decide how to approach healing our long-standing divide on immigration.

Adapted from an online discussion. Dear Carolyn: I have three kids, ages 5 and under, and life is hectic. We have child care during our working hours but are otherwise pretty much constantly looking after our kids. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight My mom always says she wants to help, and on rare occasions she will take the older two overnight, which IS a big help. But sometimes I need smaller-scale help, such as someone to watch the kids while I take a shower or do the laundry. She offers that, but when I get out of the shower, she tuts about how she had to do all the dishes. Or while I’m doing dishes, she tuts at me about how I seem to need a shower. She comes from a place of concern (“Poor thing, I can see you haven’t had time to wash your hair!”) and she IS offering help, so do I have to tolerate that she is making me feel bad while doing it?

— Feel Bad

Feel Bad: Well, hm. A few things jump out at me.

First, sympathy. It’s so hard to find a way to be with people we love who just push our buttons. You’re willing to try now, because you want something from your mom, which is opportunistic and not ideal — but in a way it’s a good thing. Under different circumstances, you’d probably just keep her at arm’s length; by needing her, you get an opportunity to find a better way to communicate.

Second, she isn’t “making” you feel anything; she is being herself, and herself annoys you. That’s the only transaction. And you’re not “tolerating” something she does to you; you’re deciding whether the pros of her involvement outweigh the cons. That’s it.

Although you can talk to her about some of the ways the two of you communicate, this is mostly something you manage within yourself. As in: Can you change the way you interpret, and therefore respond to, your mom’s comments?

Advertisement

Adding these up, I see the mom thing working if you can, basically, get over yourself. (I.e., stop seeing it as being about you.) Accept her tutting as the verbal release of her own [stuff]. Maybe she’s anxious or awkward or craves attention or martyrdom points or whatever, and she lacks the emotional intelligence to handle it better. Can you train yourself to breathe through your own reflexive objections, toward the greater good of (now) having some help and (over time) strengthening her bond with your kids?

If yes, then try on some constructive responses to her tutting: “You’re a champ, Mom.” “Leave me the dishes if you want.” “Yeah, I swear they multiply.” Give her a few gentle options to see what releases the pressure. Pick the best one and move on.

You want to scream, but on a deeper level you want to get along better and even understand her. This is where the deep breaths come in. Ignore the impulse to react, then breathe into the greater good, then act.

Readers’ thoughts:

· Throughout high school, I was a babysitter/mother’s helper to a family. I would get regular calls stating, “I need to take a shower,” or, “I need to wash the floor. Can you come over?” I would go over for less than an hour, usually, to “make sure no one dies.” I made some pocket change, helped her tremendously, and I loved it. I believe her mother was equally help-challenged.

· Have you asked your mother (I keep typing “bother,” Freudianly) to stop making comments? Like, explicitly? I recently asked my mother to stop making comments about my body, which she sees as helpful. (“You look pregnant in that dress.”)

353,"Restaurant refuses service to Christian group, citing staff ‘dignity’","Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

A restaurant in Richmond last week canceled a reservation for a private event being held by a conservative Christian organization, citing the group’s opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “We have always refused service to anyone for making our staff uncomfortable or unsafe and this was the driving force behind our decision,” read an Instagram post from Metzger Bar and Butchery, a German-influenced restaurant in the Union Hill neighborhood whose kitchen is helmed by co-owner Brittanny Anderson, a veteran of TV cooking shows including “Top Chef” and “Chopped.” “Many of our staff are women and/or members of the LGBTQ+ community. All of our staff are people with rights who deserve dignity and a safe work environment. We respect our staff’s established rights as humans and strive to create a work environment where they can do their jobs with dignity, comfort and safety.”

The group, the Family Foundation, was set to host a dessert reception for supporters on Nov. 30, the group’s president, Victoria Cobb, wrote in a blog post describing the incident. About an hour and a half before it was slated to start, one of the restaurant’s owners called to cancel it, she wrote. “As our VP of Operations explained that guests were arriving at their restaurant shortly, she asked for an explanation,” Cobb wrote. “Sure enough, an employee looked up our organization, and their wait staff refused to serve us.”

Advertisement

The Family Foundation is based in Richmond and advocates for “policies based on biblical principles.” It has lobbied against same-sex marriage and abortion rights.

In an interview, Cobb said that since she posted about it, she has heard from people alarmed by the story and from other dining establishments making it clear they would be welcome. “A lot of people are outraged that a restaurant wants to make a litmus test at the door,” she said. “Everyone should be concerned that people are being denied service based on their politics.”

In her blog post, Cobb likened the restaurant’s move to establishments that refused to serve Black customers in the 1950s and ’60s, and she decried what she called a “double standard” by liberals who think a Colorado baker should not be allowed to refuse to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.

Advertisement

Legal experts say neither of those are apt analogies. While it’s illegal to discriminate against someone because of their race or religion, the restaurant’s refusal had to do with the group’s actions, said Elizabeth Sepper, a professor at the University of Texas. “It’s about the overall positions and policies the group has taken — it’s not about Christian vs. non-Christian,” she said. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, D.C., Seattle and the Virgin Islands specifically protect people from being refused service because of their political affiliation or ideology.

Reached by phone, Metzger co-owner Kjell Anderson said the owners had no comment beyond the Instagram post.

Restaurants have made news for taking issue with their patrons’ politics. Sarah Sanders, then the White House press secretary and now the governor-elect of Arkansas, was asked to leave the Red Hen in Lexington, Va., in 2018. The owner of the restaurant, Stephanie Wilkinson, wrote that she thought Sanders was “a person whose actions in the service of our country we felt violated basic standards of humanity.” And a judge in 2018 sided with a New York bar that ejected a customer for wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat in support of President Donald Trump.

Advertisement

If past is prologue, Metzger’s move — which was first reported by Virginia Business — is likely to bring it both criticism and support. Wilkinson described the aftermath of the incident with Sanders — which made headlines around the world — as intense. Her phone lines were hacked, she and her staff had private information about them posted online, and many of them received death threats. People took to Yelp, leaving fake negative reviews, and made reservations they had no intention of keeping. But Wilkinson said people also showed their support by driving in from miles away and by donating to local charities.

As of Tuesday, Metzger’s Yelp page was frozen and an “Unusual Activity Alert” was added. “This business recently received increased public attention, which often means people come to this page to post their views on the news,” the notice reads. “While we don’t take a stand one way or the other when it comes to this incident, we’ve temporarily disabled the posting of content to this page as we work to investigate whether the content you see here reflects actual consumer experiences rather than the recent events.”

The restaurant and the foundation used interest in the event to fundraise. Metzger on Saturday posted an image of a bourbon-based cocktail dubbed “Cracks in the Foundation” and said it would donate the profits from its sale to Equality Virginia, a group that advocates for LGBTQ rights. “We are so grateful to our many guests and neighbors for their support the past few days!” read the Instagram post. “To say thank you we are donating all proceeds from this cocktail to @equalityva tonight!”

And in its blog post describing the incident, the Family Foundation sought donations, too. “Will you consider a donation today to support our efforts to ensure that no Virginian will ever have to worry about being refused a simple meal because of his or her religious beliefs?” the post read.

354,German police arrest 25 over far-right plot to overthrow government,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

BERLIN — German authorities on Wednesday arrested 25 people suspected of plotting to use armed force to storm parliament and violently overthrow the state, marking one of country’s largest ever raids targeting right-wing extremists. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The majority of those arrested are accused of being part of a “terrorist organization,” according to the public prosecutor’s statement, while the remaining three — including a Russian national — were detained on suspicion of being supporters.

In addition to the arrests, police searched the properties of a further 27 individuals who are being investigated on an “initial suspicion” of being a member or having supported the organization, the statement said. More than 3,000 police officers were involved in the raids, which took place in 11 of Germany’s 16 states.

“Democracy is well defended,” Justice Minister Marco Buschmann tweeted afterwards. “It’s suspected that an armed attack was planned against constitutional bodies,” he added.

The accused subscribe to a range of conspiracy theories, including QAnon and the extremist Reichsbürger movement, which denies the existence of the modern German state, the prosecutor’s statement said.

“They are firmly convinced that Germany is currently governed by members of a so-called ‘deep state,’” it said, adding that they are “united by a deep rejection of state institutions.”

The group was prepared to use violence — including the murder of state representatives — to carry out its aim of replacing the existing order in Germany with its own form of government, the prosecutor said.

The group’s central “council” was headed by an individual named as Heinrich XIII P.R., whom German news media identified the individual as Prince Heinrich XIII, 71, a descendant of the House of Reuss, a royal dynasty from the German state of Thuringia.

“Since November 2021, the members of the ‘Council’ have regularly met in secret to plan the intended takeover of power in Germany and the establishment of their own state structures,” the statement said. Members believed that “liberation” would be assisted by the intervention of the “Alliance” — a secret society of military and governments, including those of Russia and the United States.

Heinrich XIII had reached out to Russian representatives inside Germany, the prosecutor’s office said — although it added there were no indications of a positive response to his overtures.

The council also had a military arm, which would have been involved in the armed takeover of the state. This body included former members of Germany’s armed forces, and recruitment efforts were targeted toward members of the military and police.

There is a suspicion that individual members of the group made preparations to use arms to force their way into the German Bundestag, or parliament, prosecutors said.

Greens party lawmaker Konstantin von Notz drew parallels to the attack on the U.S. Capitol.

“At the latest since January 6, 2021, we have known that anti-democratic speech can also be followed by actions directed against democracy and parliament,” he said. “Today, the German security authorities have succeeded in putting a stop to such plans to seize power.”

The Reichsbürger or “Reich citizen” movement subscribes to a state based on Germany’s pre-World War II borders. Modern laws and governments are considered illegitimate, and some believe that descendants of former German royal families should be reinstated in their positions.

It is a small extremist fringe that has grown in recent years, rising to more prominence during the pandemic, when its members took to the street alongside a mix of conspiracy theorists and other right-wing groups. The movement is made up of small groups active across borders and online, with German intelligence warning that some subgroups have rapidly grown in recent years.

In 2021, the movement was estimated to include about 21,000 people nationwide, according to a report by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, which estimated that about 10 percent of those were “violence-oriented.”

“The investigations provide a glimpse into the abyss of a terrorist threat from the Reichsbürger milieu,” said German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser. “The suspected terrorist organization uncovered today is — according to the state of the investigations — driven by violent overthrow fantasies and conspiracy ideologies.”

The barracks of a unit of Germany’s Special Forces Command, known as the KSK, was among the locations raided on Wednesday, Der Spiegel magazine reported. The German Defense Ministry disbanded one unit of the elite counterterrorism force in 2020 and announced a restructuring due to suspected extreme right-wing ties of its members.

According to Germany’s Die Zeit newspaper, one of the defendants posted on Telegram shortly before the raids that public prosecutors, judges and health authorities would “soon find themselves in the dock at Nuremberg 2.0,” in reference to the trials of Nazi war criminals held after World War II.

The suspects were set to appear in court on Wednesday and Thursday.

Bisset reported from London.

356,China eases covid testing and health-pass rules in wake of protests,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

China announced on Wednesday that frequent coronavirus tests and digital health codes, two pillars of its “zero covid” policy, would no longer be required for daily life or to travel within the country — a significant relaxation of previously unyielding restrictions that were protested in more than a dozen cities across the country in recent weeks.

The State Council, China’s cabinet, released a 10-point plan that also said those with less severe infections could quarantine at home rather than in centralized facilities, unless they “volunteer” to go into care. Apartment stairwells or floors would no long be considered high-risk zones after five consecutive days without any new cases, and residents must be released from these zones in a timely fashion.

Digital health passes, region-specific apps that track movement and testing history, will no longer be required for access to most buildings or public transport. Developed by major Chinese technology firms on behalf of the government, the QR codes generated by the software have been a central part of China’s extensive contact tracing.

They became so essential to getting around that people speak with terror of being “pop-upped” when a sudden notification switches your code from green to red, identifying you as an at-risk person.

Along with requirements to regularly visit PCR testing booths — at-home antigen rapid tests are not officially recognized or widely used — these apps were among the most prominent features of zero covid life in China. Some human rights activists have raised fears that they will forever remain in operation as part of China’s expanding surveillance state.

The relaxation measures were an extension of a 20-step “optimization” plan released in early November aimed at reducing the economic and social costs of arbitrary and excessive restrictions, while at the same time continuing to stress that local officials should prioritize fighting the virus.

While many of the changes represent only a stepwise evolution, rather than a reversal, from the earlier announcement, they are among the clearest signs to date that the government is serious about dismantling its strictest controls and shifting to an approach some analysts labeled “zero covid in name only.”

“The transition to living with the virus is likely to take time,” research firm Capital Economics said in a note on Wednesday. “In the interim, some restrictions will still be needed, first to buy time to vaccinate more elderly, then subsequently to manage pressure on the healthcare system during China’s reopening wave.”

Even as the rest of the world has learned to live with the coronavirus, China has consistently pledged “unswerving” adherence to a policy of removing all cases from the general public and cutting off transmission as soon as possible. Confusion followed the announcement in early November as major cities first loosened — then rapidly reinstated — testing procedures.

That lack of clarity fueled public frustration after the arrival of more transmissible variants led local authorities to impose ever harsher lockdowns, the most dramatic of which was Shanghai’s two month citywide stay-at-home order in the spring. Mounting discontent boiled over in late November when restrictions were blamed for deaths during an apartment complex fire in the far western city of Urumqi.

In protests that spread across college campuses and into the shopping and business districts of major Chinese cities, people’s calls for an end to the zero covid regime rapidly evolved into broader demands for freedom of speech, human rights, and, in one instance, even for President Xi Jinping to step down.

It’s unclear to what extent the protests informed the Chinese government’s updated rules. Officials have barely acknowledged the widespread demonstrations, which were followed by a crackdown with heavy police presence on city streets as well as detentions and phone checks for participants. The earlier, 20-point easing announcement was made before protests erupted.

Liang Wannian, head of China’s covid-19 expert adviser team, told a news conference on Wednesday that the decision to update the policy was neither “reactive” nor equivalent to “totally giving up on prevention.”

Point nine of Wednesday’s plan, however, prohibited the blocking of firefighting passages or building doorways, a possible response to outcry over the deaths of seven adults and three children in the Urumqi blaze.

The document also underscored the need to accelerate vaccinations for those over 60 and to improve monitoring of at-risk populations with underlying conditions to ensure access to health care, in a bid to plug critical gaps in the country’s pandemic defenses as it begins to accept wider circulation of the virus.

After months of continually stressing the severity of the virus, Chinese state media has in recent days published articles about patients with mild infections who make rapid and full recoveries. One headline cited an expert who declared that omicron symptoms are very similar to the flu, a sentiment that was repeatedly rejected by officials earlier in the year.

Advertisement

Even the official term for the policy of bring infections down to zero — which roughly translates as “dynamic clearing” — has begun to appear less frequently in official statements. It was not mentioned once in either Wednesday’s announcement or the subsequent news conference.

Sun Chunlan, the vice premier who has led the coronavirus response, also omitted the term from an appearance last Wednesday where she declared a “new situation and new mission” underpinning the epidemic control strategy.

Even so, many aspects of the strategy remain intact. International travel restrictions, which were absent from the latest announcement, mean China continues to require eight days of quarantine for overseas arrivals and remains closed for tourism. Beijing city on Wednesday also launched a new digital health pass for antigen tests, which it said would be voluntary.

Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Commission, told reporters on Wednesday that the winter months would make it harder to constrain the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed. “The covid pandemic is still not over,” he said, and quoted a traditional Chinese saying favored by Xi to warn of the need for constant vigilance: “To be prepared for the unexpected is a basic principle of governing.”

357,Trump team searches two of his properties amid court battle with DOJ,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Lawyers for former president Donald Trump conducted a search of at least two of his properties for classified materials in recent weeks, after they were instructed by a federal judge to attest they had fully complied with a May grand jury subpoena to turn over all materials bearing classified markings, according to people familiar with the matter.

Trump’s legal team hired an outside firm to carry out the search of his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., and, more recently, Trump Tower in New York, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.

The team also offered the FBI the opportunity to observe the search, but the offer was declined, the people said. It would be unusual for federal agents to monitor a search of someone’s property conducted by anyone other than another law enforcement agency. Federal authorities have already searched Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s primary residence, and he spends almost all of his time at those three properties, advisers say.

Trump’s lawyers have told the Justice Department that the outside team did not turn up any new classified information during their search, according to people familiar with the process, and have said they utilized a firm that had expertise in searching for documents.

A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment.

“President Trump and his counsel continue to be cooperative and transparent,” Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said, accusing the Justice Department of committing an “unprecedented” and “unwarranted attack” against Trump and his family.

Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell told Trump’s legal team to continue to search for documents after the Justice Department expressed concerns that the team had not fully complied with a subpoena earlier this year. Howell, according to people familiar with the matter, did not give specific orders on how a search should be done.

The group first conducted a search of Bedminster, and Trump’s attorneys have now attested to the Justice Department that no further materials were found, two people familiar with the matter said.

Howell’s instructions followed a breakdown in the government’s trust in Trump’s attorneys that led prosecutors in August to seek a court-authorized FBI search of Mar-a-Lago. Since that time, prosecutors have continued to question whether Trump has returned all materials with classification markings, although what steps the government might take to retrieve such materials or procedures it might require Trump’s advisers and lawyers to implement remain unclear.

Trump’s team has sought to avoid another high-profile search of his properties, the people familiar with the matter said.

According to the people, at least one of Trump’s lawyers has previously advocated for a less aggressive approach to the Justice Department investigation of Trump and his advisers for three potential crimes: mishandling of national security secrets, obstruction and destruction of government records.

That attorney, former Florida solicitor general Christopher Kise, had proposed such a search months earlier. Many of the other lawyers on Trump’s team have rebuffed Kise’s advice, and he has taken a reduced role in the classified documents case while taking a larger role in the New York investigations into the former president, the people said.

Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence and export control section at the Justice Department, communicated to Trump’s lawyers after the FBI search that the department was concerned Trump still may not have returned all the classified documents in his possession. The Washington Post has previously reported that officials at the National Archives also believe that there may still be more records missing. Previous attempts by Trump’s attorneys to identify and return documents proved unsatisfactory to investigators.

At times in the past, Trump has misled his own lawyers as to what was in the boxes that were taken from Mar-a-Lago, The Post has reported.

For example, he told some on his team that he only possessed newspaper clippings and personal items in 2021. One of his former lawyers, Alex Cannon, declined Trump’s entreaty to tell the National Archives he had returned all items because Cannon was not sure if it was true, and his team in February did not release a statement dictated by Trump that claimed he had returned all materials, The Post has reported.

Trump lawyers Christina Bobb and Evan Corcoran met with investigators in June, handing over a taped-up folder of 38 documents collected from the former president’s residence in response to a May subpoena, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter. Prosecutors called the response “incomplete” in court documents and said that they collected evidence of “obstructive conduct” regarding the failure to fully comply with the subpoena.

Bobb signed a certification swearing that she had been told that “a diligent search” was conducted of boxes of records shipped from the White House to Florida when Trump left office, and that the file handed over to investigators contained “all documents that are responsive to the subpoena.” Corcoran told the visiting investigators he had been advised that all available boxes placed in a storage room — and nowhere else — had been searched in response to the subpoena, The Post reported.

Soon after, investigators obtained video surveillance of the club and conducted more interviews with Trump staffers, leading them to seek a search warrant from a judge on the basis of new evidence that sensitive material still remained at Mar-a-Lago, The Post has reported. When agents executed the search warrant in August, they found additional documents with classified markings in the storage room and in Trump’s office, along with thousands of other government papers and items, according to court records.

Perry Stein and Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report.

358,Trump Organization convicted in N.Y. criminal tax fraud trial,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

NEW YORK — Former president Donald Trump’s namesake company was convicted Tuesday of tax crimes committed by two of its longtime executives after a Manhattan trial that gave jurors a peek at some of the inner workings of the Trump Organization’s finances. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The real estate, hospitality and golf resort operation headquartered at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue faces the possibility of a $1.6 million fine at a sentencing scheduled Jan. 13. New York Supreme Court jurors began deliberations Monday.

The company was charged with scheme to defraud, conspiracy, criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records. Trump has not been charged with wrongdoing.

The verdicts Tuesday came amid other troubles for the Trump family business, which was sued by New York Attorney General Letitia James in September in a civil case that accuses Trump, three of his adult children and longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg of manipulating the valuations of their properties to get better terms on loans and insurance policies, and to get tax breaks. The suit seeks to recover more than $250 million and has the potential to cripple the Trump Organization’s ability to continue doing business in the state.

In the criminal case, jurors saw a number of Trump Organization payroll and expense records spanning years that showed how executives received perks like luxury apartments and Mercedes Benzes while purposely concealing them from tax authorities.

“This was a case about lying and cheating, false documents to the end of evading taxes for the benefit of individuals and the [Trump Organization],” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said at the courthouse after the verdict. “They have now been held accountable in a court of law.”

Trump Organization spokeswoman Kimberly Benza said in a statement that it is “preposterous” the company could be “held responsible for an employee’s actions,” pointing to elements of Weisselberg’s testimony in which he said he was motivated by his own “greed” and that he had “betrayed” the Trump family.

Prosecutors built the case largely around Weisselberg, who pleaded guilty in August to 15 counts including tax fraud, conspiracy and grand larceny. He was promised a steeply reduced sentence of five months in jail in exchange for testifying against the company. He had faced up to 15 years in prison.

In his testimony, Weisselberg detailed how he and the company’s comptroller, Jeffrey McConney, schemed to cheat state and federal tax authorities beginning in 2005 and lasting more than a decade. Weisselberg used the company to cover major personal expenses like rent for a luxury apartment on the Hudson River, Mercedes Benz leases for himself and his wife, and private school tuition for his grandchildren.

In some instances, he paid the company back for his personal expenses, which allowed him to use pre-tax compensation illegally. Other expenses were paid for by the company but not reported as taxable income as required by tax laws.

McConney, who admitted in his testimony to committing crimes, was granted immunity under New York law because he was called by prosecutors as a grand jury witness in the case.

Prosecutors argued that the conduct of Weisselberg and McConney made the company criminally liable. Two Trump Organization entities — the Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corp. — were on trial. Both were found guilty on all charges — 17 counts in total.

The company “cultivated a culture of fraud and deception of lavishing illicit perks to entice its most senior executives of falsifying tax reporting documents to mask the true compensation they paid those executives,” Assistant Manhattan District Attorney Joshua Steinglass argued in his summation last week.

He also accused the company of “scapegoating” its accountants “for not being vigilant enough to sniff out their malfeasance.”

Lawyers for the entities said Weisselberg had no intent to help the company — only himself — and that prosecutors did not successfully prove there was corporate liability. Prosecutors said the company saved on their Medicare tax responsibility and benefited in other ways from the scheme.

The Manhattan district attorney’s office made a point at the close of the case to say Trump had personal knowledge of the tax cheating carried out by his executives. During his summation, Steinglass pointed to a document that had been initialed by Trump and called it “explicit” proof of his knowing that his executives were tinkering with expenses to reduce their tax liabilities.

In a recent social media post, Trump denied having knowledge of the crimes Weisselberg and McConney committed.

Bragg’s office is investigating other aspects of potential criminality, including whether Trump illegally misrepresented his wealth to bank and insurance officials to get better loan and policy rates.

Bragg recently appointed former Justice Department senior official Matthew Colangelo to senior counsel. Colangelo is likely to be involved in the ongoing Trump review.

359,Democrats ramp up investigation of Kushner family business dealings,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Democrats on a pair of congressional committees have launched an aggressive new effort to obtain information about whether Jared Kushner’s actions on U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf region as a senior White House adviser were influenced by the bailout of a property owned by his family business. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Citing previously undisclosed emails and other documents related to former president Donald Trump’s son-in-law, the committees on Monday night sent letters to the State and Defense departments requesting material that they say could shed new light on whether “Kushner’s financial conflict of interest may have led him to improperly influence U.S. tax, trade and national security policies for his own financial gain.”

The letters, obtained by The Washington Post, focus on efforts by Kushner and his father, Charles Kushner, to bail out a troubled 41-story Fifth Avenue office building in New York City. The Kushner company in 2018 made a deal with a Canadian company, Brookfield Asset Management, which invested $1.2 billion for a 99-year lease. As a result, the Kushner family company avoided defaulting on a loan that was due the following year.

Advertisement

Democrats have long raised questions about the deal because the Qatar Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund, had a stake in one of Brookfield’s investment arms.

Brookfield said when it was negotiating its deal in 2018 that “no Qatar-linked entity has any involvement in or even knowledge of this potential transaction.” But Democrats have continued probing whether any Qatari money went into the project.

Now, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), in their roles as chairs of the Senate Finance Committee and House Oversight Committee, have broadened that inquiry, co-authoring letters to the State and Defense departments. They wrote that they are seeking an array of documents addressing their concerns that Jared Kushner’s role in Middle East policy could have played a role in the bailout.

Neither Jared Kushner, who now runs a private-equity company, nor Charles Kushner, who serves as chairman of the Kushner real estate company, responded to requests for comment.

The saga of the Fifth Avenue property has long been one of the darkest chapters in Jared Kushner’s career.

After his father went to prison for federal tax evasion and other charges after being convicted in 2005, Kushner — who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump — remade the family real estate business. He sold many of the company’s New Jersey apartments and paid $1.8 billion for the Fifth Avenue property, the most ever paid in the United States for an office building at that time. While Kushner called it a “great acquisition,” the purchase came just before the 2007 real estate crash, undercutting the value of the property and putting the family business at risk.

Advertisement

As Kushner recounted in “Breaking History,” his recent memoir: “There was no way I was going to let the investment fail. I had very little leverage, so I was willing to talk to anybody.” He called it the biggest challenge of his career.

By 2016, Kushner was simultaneously helping to run Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and seeking an investor to take over the property. A previously undisclosed email obtained by the committees says that Kushner talked with top Brookfield officials about the Fifth Avenue property on April 15, 2016. The property at the time was known as 666 Fifth Ave. and is now known as 660 Fifth Ave.

Five days later, in an email with the subject line “re 666,” Brookfield’s then-chairman, Ric Clark, wrote: “Jared — thanks for coming down last Friday. We are excited about your project.” Clark ended the email writing, “Congratulations on yesterday’s election,” apparently a reference to Trump’s victory in the New York Republican primary, which helped him secure the nomination. Clark did not respond to a request for comment.

In December 2016, as Kushner worked on Trump’s transition team, he met with representatives of a Chinese insurance firm regarding potentially investing in the property, the New York Times reported. Kushner also met with a Russian banker but told Congress that family business was not discussed, although the bank has said they talked about “promising business lines and sectors.”

Then, as Kushner began his White House role, he divested himself of his interest in the Fifth Avenue property and cut ties with the family company, where his father worked. At the same time, he retained real estate assets valued between $132 million and $407 million, The Post has reported.

As Kushner worked on Middle East policy, his father in April 2017 held a meeting with Qatar’s finance minister at which the Fifth Avenue property was discussed. Charles Kushner later told The Post that even if the Qataris had offered to wire funds on the spot, he would have turned them down to avoid questions about a conflict of interest with his son.

Jared Kushner played a significant role in policy affecting Qatar. He had helped persuade Trump to strengthen ties with Saudi Arabia during a May 2017 visit to the Arab nation. A month later, Saudi Arabia joined several countries in breaking relationships with Qatar and imposing a blockade, accusing Qatar of financing terrorism. Kushner wrote in his memoir that, contrary to accusations by some in the administration, he was not to blame for the Saudi action against Qatar and “tried to convince them to delay the decision.” He then tried to work to lift the blockade against Qatar, he wrote.

With questions swirling about whether Kushner used his influence to get investors to bail out the Fifth Avenue building, Charles Kushner in January 2018 gave his first interview about the matter, telling The Post that he had purposefully avoided doing business with sovereign investment funds or similar entities, to avoid a conflict of interest with his son’s White House job.

A month after that interview, according to emails obtained by the committees, Charles Kushner talked with Clark, the Brookfield chairman, about investing in the Fifth Avenue property. An associate of Charles Kushner then emailed Clark with a summary of a proposed deal.

Two months later, Qatar’s leader visited the White House and Trump officials called for an end to the blockade. In their letter, the committees said the Trump administration’s support for the blockade “evaporated shortly after Charles Kushner’s discussion with Brookfield,” but they did not supply evidence that the two events are linked.

The following month, Brookfield and the Kushner real estate company confirmed that they were negotiating a deal on the Fifth Avenue building. Both parties said that at the time that there was no Qatari involvement in the investment, which was finalized later in 2018. Jared Kushner did not mention Brookfield in his memoir.

In the waning days of the Trump administration, Charles Kushner — who had been convicted of filing false tax returns and other charges — was pardoned by Trump and Jared Kushner traveled to the Persian Gulf region to finalize a deal to end the blockade of Qatar. The day after the Trump administration ended, Kushner created a private equity firm, for which he obtained a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. The fund is headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who the CIA has said ordered the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist.

In recent days, Kushner traveled to Qatar, where he was photographed at the World Cup with some of that nation’s leaders.

Democrats, meanwhile, have repeatedly sought information about the Fifth Avenue property bailout from Brookfield and Kushner.

On Dec. 9, 2020, Wyden co-authored a letter to Brookfield saying that despite Brookfield’s assurance that no Qatari money was involved in the deal, “it appears that is exactly what happened,” and requested documentation from the company about it. Then, on Oct. 13, 2022, Wyden sent another letter to Brookfield, accusing the company of “stonewalling on whether it intentionally misled the public” about the use of Qatar-linked funds to bail out the Kushner family property. Wyden alleged that Brookfield’s initial assurance that no Qatar-linked entities were involved “turned out to be false.”

Asked about Wyden’s allegations by The Post, Brookfield issued a statement that did not directly address the question of Qatar’s role: “We have been fully transparent and responded to all requests. As we have said all along, the decision to acquire this building was based purely on its own merits — it was an iconic, underperforming building in a prime location in need of significant redevelopment. The building has now been transformed, and we believe it will exceed our expectations in delivering value for our clients.”

The Qatar Investment Authority said via email that it would not comment. Qatari officials have previously said they did not learn about the Brookfield investment in the Kushner property until it was reported in the media. Subsequently, Reuters reported in 2019 that the Qatar Investment Authority would avoid putting its money in investment funds that it does not control.

The committees’ letter this week marks the most aggressive request yet for new information. The committees are seeking all relevant correspondence related to the Kushner family company, Brookfield, the Qatari fund, the blockade and other matters.

In addition, the committees said, they are requesting any correspondence that refers to “Kushner seeking to influence, interfere with, or supersede the normal operations and responsibilities” of the State and Defense departments.

But especially in a winter when soaring rents and heating costs are a recurring topic of conversation, people seem reluctant to extend much sympathy to the rebel royals — and don’t buy their argument that the Metropolitan Police should be responsible for their security when in Britain.

That doesn’t mean people won’t watch the show, which Netflix is promoting, optimistically, as a “global event.”

Harry and Meghan are, not for the first time, opening up about their relationship.

This six-episode program is part of their reported multimillion-dollar deal with Netflix. The first three episodes will drop Thursday, the last three on Dec. 15.

That’s all in the run-up to the scheduled publication next month of Harry’s memoir, “Spare,” which he promises will be an “unflinching” account of royal life.

Harry and Meghan claim they ceded some editorial control in the making of the docuseries. “We’re trusting our story to someone else, and that means it will go through their lens,” Meghan told Variety magazine.

But in addition to cooperating for interviews, the couple selectively granted access and provided some of the video footage. Their for-profit media company, Archewell, is listed as one of two producers.

Netflix did not answer questions from The Washington Post about whether the couple had any say in the script or editing or final cut.

Image curation efforts by the British royal family certainly aren’t new. The palace PR operation was an established influencer long before Instagram. And both of Harry’s parents, King Charles III and Princess Diana, sat for interviews with sympathetic journalists and cooperated on biographies.

Harry and Meghan have just embraced new means to tell their story. At first it was about building their social media presence. But, since they stepped down as working royals and had to give up their Sussex Royal accounts, they have turned to podcasts, alongside TV interviews — most notably with Oprah Winfrey. They have also pursued lawsuits against British tabloids.

Many apparent themes of the docuseries are ones they’ve hit before.

In one clip, Harry talks about the “pain and suffering” of the women — presumably including his wife and mother — who marry into his family.

The trailers show previously unseen photos, including pictures of the couple in happy times, jumping in the air, kissing at their wedding. There are also much more somber moments where Meghan appears to be upset.

The trailers suggest media harassment and online bigotry are both to blame.

“It’s about hatred, it’s about race,” says Christopher Bouzy, whose tech company developed a tool to track Twitter hate.

He told The Post that he was interviewed for the documentary for two hours in March.

“Based on what I know on targeted campaigning, it’s important for folks to understand what this couple has gone through. It’s important to get their side of the story from them,” he said.

Their side of the story also implicates members of the House of Windsor.

“There’s a hierarchy of the family,” Harry says at one point. “There’s leaking, but there’s also the planting of stories. It’s a dirty game.”

And if it is a dirty game, who is playing it? Harry’s brother, William, heir to the throne? Or his father, the new king?

If there is a thawing of relations between California-based Harry and Meghan and their kin back in Britain, it’s not on display in the trailers.

The second clip ends with Harry saying: “No one knows the full truth. We know the full truth.”

On the whole, the promotional material conveys “an incredibly strong sense of victimhood,” said Valentine Low, author of “Courtiers: Intrigue, Ambition and the Power Players Behind the House of Windsor.”

“There is a reasonable debate to have” about whether the royal institution has done enough to support those who marry into it, Low said in an interview with The Post. “But [Harry] loses me when he says no one knows the full truth but them, implying they have a monopoly on truth. What about those women who say they were bullied by Meghan? They have a truth, too.”

Last year, Buckingham Palace announced an investigation into bullying accusations by former palace staff.

The documentary’s claim on truth has already been undermined by questions about some of the photos it uses. One showing a bank of photographers seems to be from a 2011 Harry Potter film premiere. Harry and Meghan met in 2016 and married two years later.

Reaction by tabloid journalists has been defensive — and harsh.

Piers Morgan, a Sun columnist and longtime critic of Meghan whose voice can be heard in the trailer, wrote on Monday, “Another day, another nauseatingly self-serving whiny trailer from royal renegades Meghan and Harry for their upcoming Netflix trash-a-thon of their family.”

The mainstream Times of London ran a front-page headline on Tuesday that declared: “Prince Harry and Meghan have declared all-out war against the royal family.”

Advertisement

In the Spectator, the conservative magazine’s anonymous gossip columnist began his take of the trailers with, “Quick, nurse, pass the sick bag! The wokest couple in all the West is at it again.”

He continues, “In one glorious snippet, Harry — that embodiment of English aristocracy — bemoans how ‘there’s a hierarchy of the family.’ In the royals? Who knew!”

While some decry Harry and Meghan for trying to push their own narrative into the public realm, there is plenty of precedent.

“They have all been trying to get their stories across in one way or another since 1969,” said Low, referring to the Windsors.

That was the year that the BBC aired the fly-on-the-wall documentary, “Royal Family.” Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip had invited the cameras to showcase the private, human side of royal life. There’s footage of the queen buying ice cream and Charles whisking salad dressing, along with the monarch making small talk with President Richard M. Nixon. It was a massive hit, viewed by a global audience of more than 350 million. But the royals may not have loved the end result. It hasn’t been aired since the 1970s, reportedly at the behest of the family.

Charles and Diana both sought to tell their side of things after their fairy-tale marriage fell apart.

Author Andrew Morton has acknowledged (and released the tapes) that the princess was the main source for his 1992 biography, “Diana: Her True Story,” which included details about how Charles’s affair fueled her eating disorder and suicide attempts. Diana also made waves in her interview with the BBC’s Martin Bashir, famously saying, “There were three of us in this marriage.”

For his part, Charles sought the help of journalist Jonathan Dimbleby, who published a much more positive version of events in “The Prince of Wales: A Biography” in 1994, alongside an accompanying documentary, in which Charles concedes he cheated on his wife, but only after the marriage was disintegrating.

In a sense, though, no one exercised greater image control than the queen, who never sat for a formal interview with a journalist in 70 years on the throne.

361,Six holiday movie events to put on your calendar,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

When it’s time to choose holiday entertainment, many people default to familiar carols or theater — that’s why the calendar is full of them. But sometimes it’s nice to enjoy a seasonal movie. We’re not suggesting you just zone out in front of a screen, though: These events include interactive date nights as well as family activities.

Hallmark Movie Sew Days at Three Little Birds: While it’s fun to get lost in the familiar plot of a holiday movie — oh, look, a busy big-city business executive has to return to her tiny hometown and save a beloved inn/bakery/tree farm — those storylines also make excellent background noise while working on other activities. Three Little Birds, a sewing studio in Hyattsville, knows and appreciates this. The Hallmark Movie Sew Days allow anyone to use the shop’s sewing machines, cutting tables and tools for a three-hour block while watching Hallmark movies and sipping hot cocoa. Bring a personal project or pick up a new embroidery piece at the store. Friday at 11 a.m., 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. $20.

Holiday Movie Pajama Party at the Boro: This family-friendly screening at the Showplace Icon Theatre in Tysons has a bonus for frazzled parents: no need to convince the kids to change out of their pajamas! Tickets include a choice of three films at the high-end theater — “Arthur Christmas,” “The Polar Express” or “Elf” — and a small popcorn and apple juice, followed by an after-party in the lobby with music, crafts and a photo booth. Saturday. Films begin at 9:45, 10 and 10:15 a.m. $8.

‘Elf’ Movie Parties at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema: The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear — or going to one of Alamo Drafthouse Cinema’s interactive screenings of “Elf,” where the audience members don elf hats and jingle bells, recite favorite lines with the characters, and join in a chorus of “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.” Screenings take place at both the Bryant Street NE and Crystal City locations. Saturday through Monday. Times vary by location. $16-$17.

Christmas horror films at Suns Cinema: Feel-good movies are a staple at this time of year, but some of us will happily trade saccharine sweetness for blood and gore. Mount Pleasant art house Suns Cinema has some unusual presents lurking among “Gremlins” and “Die Hard,” including the cult French film “Dial Code Santa Claus” (think “Home Alone” with a kid fighting off a murderous Saint Nick); the self-explanatory “Silent Night, Deadly Night”; and “Don’t Open Till Christmas,” a 1984 slasher film marketed with the tag line “’Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring — they were all dead!” Various dates and times. $12.

‘A Muppet Christmas Carol’ at the Kennedy Center: Thirty years after its theatrical release, “A Muppet Christmas Carol” is still a family favorite. English actor Michael Caine, better known for playing spies and gangsters, plays a not-quite-cruel Scrooge in this musical version, while Kermit the Frog is Bob Cratchit and Gonzo portrays Charles Dickens, the narrator, accompanied by Rizzo the Rat. The screening takes place in the Justice Forum auditorium at the Reach, and while the Kennedy Center’s website says advance tickets are sold out, same-day tickets will be available at the Hall of States Box Office. Sunday at 3 p.m. Free.

Spoons, Toons and Booze Christmas Special at Arlington Cinema and Drafthouse: Charlie Brown and the Grinch get all the love at this time of year, but back in the 1980s and 1990s, it seemed like every Saturday morning cartoon franchise had a Very Special Holiday Episode, from He-Man and the Smurfs to the X-Men and Robotech. The annual Spoons, Toons and Booze screening brings them all together for a morning of classic cartoons, plus an all-you-can-eat “sugary cereal bar,” cereal-inspired cocktails, an ugly sweater competition and more holiday fun. Dec. 17 and 18 at noon. $15.

362,Slugger Aaron Judge reportedly agrees to deal to return to New York Yankees,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

SAN DIEGO — The biggest news of the Major League Baseball offseason broke shortly after 5 a.m. at the Winter Meetings on Wednesday morning, when word circulated that 2022 American League MVP Aaron Judge would remain a New York Yankee. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The homegrown New York star agreed to a nine-year deal that will pay him $360 million, according to multiple reports. The San Francisco Giants, Judge’s hometown team, had long been in pursuit of the former Yankees star, who has secured the third-largest total contract guarantee ever and will make more in average annual value than any position player in history. The deal was first reported by MLB Network.

Judge will make $130 million more in this deal than he would have had he accepted the $230 million the Yankees would have paid him from 2022 to 2028 via the extension they offered him in April. He hit 62 homers and was in striking distance of the AL batting title until the last few weeks of the regular season. He was the backbone of the Yankees offense — and sometimes all the other bones, too. And he ensured he got a historic deal as a result.

The signing will probably set off a frenzied pivot from big spenders such as the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres, both of whom chased big offensive stars this winter. It means the Los Angeles Dodgers will have missed out on several of the winter’s top available stars, with shortstops Carlos Correa and Xander Bogaerts lingering as two of the top offensive options remaining.

And the deal does not signal the end of the offseason for the Yankees but rather a prerequisite: They were not good enough to catch the Houston Astros with Judge last season. Re-signing him was the baseline from which they needed to start reshaping their roster this winter. Losing him would have been destabilizing.

But Judge will return to the Yankees clubhouse as the closest thing it has seen to Derek Jeter in a generation and does so following in Jeter’s carefully calculated footsteps as he tiptoes around the public pitfalls New York always seems to elicit from its superstars. Many of Judge’s teammates have said they support Judge being named captain of their storied franchise, an honor more meaningful there than just about anywhere else given the others (Jeter, late catcher Thurman Munson, Lou Gehrig, etc.) who were given that title. Judge said multiple times he wanted to be a Yankee for life. He will be almost 40 when his new deal ends.

This is a developing story and will be updated.

363,"More than 1 in 5 workers worldwide have experienced harassment or violence at work, survey concludes","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

More than 1 in 5 workers have experienced violence or harassment at their workplace, according to a global survey released this week. The risk of workplace violence or harassment was greater if the worker was younger, if the worker was a migrant and if the worker was not self-employed, according to the survey conducted in 2021 from the United Nations International Labour Organization, the London-based Lloyd’s Register Foundation and Gallup. Overall, a slightly higher percentage of women experienced violence or harassment than men, the poll showed. But young women were twice as likely as young men to suffer sexual violence and harassment.

The survey of 74,364 people age 15 or older and employed at the time of their interviews was conducted across 121 countries. It found that 23 percent of them had experience with physical, psychological or sexual violence or harassment at work, higher among younger workers than older workers.

The poll placed workplace violence and harassment into three categories: physical, psychological and sexual.

Sexual violence or harassment included unwanted sexual touching, comments, pictures, emails or sexual requests. Worldwide, 6 percent of workers reported sexual violence or harassment at work.

More women (8 percent) than men (5 percent) reported sexual violence or harassment at work, the largest difference among the three forms of violence and harassment the survey measured.

Twelve percent of workers in the Americas, including 18 percent of women, experienced sexual violence or harassment at work.

Physical violence or harassment was defined in the survey as hitting, restraining or spitting. Worldwide, 9 percent of workers reported such violence. Geographically, Africa registered the highest prevalence of such violence with 13 percent saying they had experienced this kind of treatment. Globally, more men faced such workplace violence than women (9 percent versus 7 percent).

Psychological violence or harassment was defined as experiencing insults, threats, bullying or intimidation at work. Globally, 18 percent of workers have encountered such behavior, the survey found. Women reported such violence and harassment at a higher rate than men (19 percent vs. 17 percent). Nearly 3 in 10 workers in the Americas (29 percent) reported such treatment, outpacing all other geographic regions.

The International Labour Organization, Lloyd’s Register Foundation and Gallup Violence and Harassment at Work survey was conducted as part of the 2021 Gallup World Poll through face-to-face interviews and telephone interviews of 74,364 individuals in 121 countries who were employed at the time of their interviews.

364,A review of the best and worst franchise records in professional sports,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

On Sunday, the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears, 28-19. Both teams are having mediocre seasons, to put it generously — the Bears more so. But this contest was far more than a measure of which currently bad team was worse. It was also a measure of which historically good team was better.

With their win, the Packers reached 787 franchise victories over the team’s lengthy history. As it happened, they and the Bears were tied at 786 entering the game, lending a significance it otherwise would have lacked.

It does raise an interesting question, though: Just how do other teams stack up over their own franchise histories? For every Green Bay Packers, after all, there’s an Atlanta Falcons, which has more than 100 more losses than wins over its franchise history. Who, then, are the best active franchises in history? And, more fun, who are the worst?

Immediately you can see that we get into some trouble. The Washington Post’s local baseball team is the Washington Nationals. Do we count the Montreal Expos in the franchise history? The Washington Senators, though they moved to Minnesota to become the Twins?

Advertisement

The proper and natural way to resolve this question is to punt it to someone else, so we chose to use franchise definitions established by the encyclopedic sports sites collected under the Sports Reference umbrella. So the Expos’ (few) wins get added to the Nats’, and the Twins are saddled with the Senators’ (many) losses.

From there, it’s straightforward: Collect data on the all-time win-loss records of teams in the professional baseball, basketball, football, hockey and soccer leagues through Monday and sort them by win percentage. The result is below. For reasons that will soon become apparent, teams along the Philly-to-D.C. axis have been highlighted.

As you skimmed, you hopefully noticed that we delineated the teams that had winning percentages above .500 and those below — a group that will figure more prominently a bit further down in this article.

Advertisement

You probably also noticed that a surprising number of Major League Soccer teams with high, and low, winning percentages. That’s a byproduct of a smaller sample. Because those teams are newer, they have fewer wins and fewer losses. That’s exacerbated by the fact that soccer matches can end in draws (known as ties for the rest of this article for the sake of consistency). With fewer matches played, it’s easier to have a higher win percentage overall. Win two of three games and you’re at .667, for example. Win 666 of 1,000 games and your win percentage is slightly lower.

You can see that clearly if we show the same ranking as above, but with actual wins and losses displayed. You can also see that baseball franchises are the champions of games played for the obvious reasons of longevity and games-per-season.

If we limit our winning percentage analysis to teams that have played at least 1,000 games, we end up with top five teams in each sport that probably look familiar.

Advertisement

Rank MLB NBA NFL NHL 1. Yankees (.570) Lakers (.592) Packers (.572) Canadiens (.598) 2. Giants (.536) Spurs (.592) Bears (.559) Flyers (.583) 3. Dodgers (.531) Celtics (.591) 49ers (.543) Bruins (.577) 4. Cardinals (.521) Jazz (.545) Steelers (.535) Wild (.567) 5. Red Sox (.518) Suns (.536) Giants (.529) Predators (.567)

Even if the Bears had won Sunday, the Packers still would have had a higher winning percentage, given that they have fewer losses. With that, let us turn from historic winners to historic losers.

You might have noticed that teams from along the Philly-D.C. corridor tended to land in the below-.500 space of that first chart. Well, as it turns out, two of those teams — the Philadelphia Phillies and the Baltimore Orioles — end up the furthest from .500. The Orioles need to win more than 1,000 more games than they lose before they’re breaking even over franchise history; the Phillies need to win more than 1,100.

When we look at how far teams are from .500, though, we again see that Major League Baseball is overrepresented. The Phillies have been around for well more than a century and now play 162 games a year! Even if they had averaged just 10 more losses than wins over that period — a not-too-embarrassing 76-86 record each year — you arrive at a net deficit of 1,000 games over 100 years.

So let’s shift the context a little. Baseball teams play 162 games a year, meaning that, if the Phillies had a few perfect seasons — which … is unlikely, but work with us here — they’d eat substantially into that deficit. So let’s consider that metric instead. What teams would need the most perfect seasons to make up for their win-loss deficit?

The winner, by far, is the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals. If the Cardinals won every regular-season game from now until 2034, they would be, at last, at .500. By this metric, the Phillies are just the fifth-least successful franchise in American professional sports.

Now let’s talk about the Washington Commanders. You’ll notice above that they need less than one perfect season to reach .500. In fact, they need just three more wins than losses to hit .500 over franchise history — not likely this season, but possible. And for a team currently at the bottom of its division, an imaginary metric worth celebrating. The Packers can explain how good that can feel.

365,"‘Once-in-a-lifetime’ find of 1,300-year-old necklace dazzles historians","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

LONDON — A 1,300-year-old necklace beaded with gold and semiprecious stones has been discovered in an early-Anglo Saxon burial site under a construction project in central England. The location is being hailed as the most significant female burial site from the era discovered in Britain. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight “This find is truly a once-in-a-lifetime discovery — the sort of thing you read about in textbooks and not something you expect to see coming out of the ground in front of you,” archaeologist Simon Mortimer, who worked on the excavation, said in a statement announcing the find.

The necklace, believed to belong to a devout medieval woman, almost certainly an aristocrat, shines new light on the spread of early Christianity through medieval Europe and offers a glimpse into the role played by elite women in forging England’s Christian identity, experts say.

The jewelry piece, dating to between 630 and 670 AD, was discovered at a gravesite near Northampton this year, and archaeologists announced the details of the find Tuesday. The necklace contains 30 trinkets, including four garnets set in gold, five glass pendants, eight Roman gold coins, and 12 beads, all set around an intricate rectangular pendant marked with a cross motif.

“It wasn’t just one or two items. That would have been incredible in its own,” Paul Thompson, who managed the excavation, told The Washington Post. “We have here the only complete example of this type of necklace excavated in modern archaeological standards. … It’s an asymmetrical set-out of the gold coins, and the precious stones mounted in gold, which we haven’t seen before.”

The item’s centerpiece is a crucifix pendant formed of red garnets and believed by archaeologists to have originally formed half of a hinged clasp before being repurposed into wearable jewelry.

The artifacts, which also contain two decorated pots and a shallow copper dish, have been dubbed the Harpole Treasure, after the name of a nearby village.

The buried woman’s identity is not known, but she is thought likely to have been either an abbess or member of Saxon royalty — if not both. Her skeleton, which was found under the site of a future housing development, was fully decomposed apart from tiny fragments of surviving tooth enamel, said officials at the Museum of London Archaeology, which led the excavation.

Archaeologists also identified deeper in the soil a second decorated cross with the help of X-ray technology. That item features at least four human faces cast in silver and set around the crucifix — a highly unusual detail.

Experts have hailed the find as particularly significant evidence of the role played by elite women at the time. “This woman probably belonged to the first generation of English Christians in this part of England,” Francis Young, a historian of religion who was not involved in the excavation, told The Post. “This is people wanting to show off their newly acquired identity as Christians.”

Advertisement

“We know about these people from deeds, from literary sources, from hagiographies, but very often we don’t have much material evidence for their existence,” he said, adding that these aristocratic women played a central role in spreading new religious practices: “There is a form of soft power exercised by these queens.”

Abbesses at the time had their own land holdings and property rights, Young said, and so were able to create and lead monastic sites where Christians could be deployed to convert the people in the surrounding countryside. “It’s essentially about missionaries going out and persuading the local warlord, or king, that adopting Christianity is a good option to him. Often, it will not be directly persuading him, but persuading his wife.”

“Christianity provided a way for women to gain independence and power in their own right, by enabling them to run monastic houses, so we see an increase in elite women using Christianity as a means of increasing their status,” Emma Brownlee, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge, told The Post. “In this burial, we’re seeing a particularly fine example of that process.”

Advertisement

Conservators continue to examine the artifacts, paying particular attention to traces of organic remains that have been found both around the burial site and on the surface of the artifacts themselves — suggesting the woman’s corpse was buried on a softly furnished bed. Excavators have already discovered iron fittings and staining from a timber bed frame at the site.

“Bed burials are quite a rare form of burial, in England exclusive to women, probably Christian women, in the conversion period,” Brownlee added. “The ritual of burying someone in a bed was most likely imported into England as part of the Christianization process, and some women buried in beds were likely women who migrated from continental Christian areas into England as part of the conversion process.”

A number of similar necklaces from this era have been discovered in England before, the archaeologists say, but none are as ornate as the Harpole Treasure. Its closest equivalent is the late-7th-century Desborough Necklace, which was found in Northamptonshire in 1876 and is held in the British Museum.

366,Morocco fans celebrate across Europe after historic World Cup advance,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

LONDON — They danced, set off flares and partied through the night. From London to Paris to Milan, Arabs, Africans and other fans of Morocco’s national soccer team filled the streets after it booted Spain out of the World Cup, a shock win that made Morocco the first Arab nation to reach the tournament’s quarterfinals. The national team, known as the “Atlas Lions,” is also the first African squad to do so since Ghana in 2010.

The tense game in Qatar — the competition’s first Middle Eastern host — culminated in a penalty kick shootout. Nervous fans covered their eyes and held their breath as Morocco notched a 3-0 lead, ousting former World Cup champion Spain on Tuesday night.

Morocco’s star player, Achraf Hakimi, who was born in Madrid, shot the final goal into the back of the net, eliciting an earthquake of thunderous cheers at the Education City Stadium in Doha.

In European capitals, crowds also erupted with delight at the win.

Sanae Touhtouh, a 28-year-old Moroccan who works at a cafe in London, looked on with pride as people poured into the street. Jordanian, Palestinian and Lebanese colleagues also watched the game, and “everyone was celebrating,” she told The Washington Post early Wednesday. “You feel that you are sharing one joy.”

“It’s a really beautiful feeling to see your country become the first Arab nation to make it,” she added. “I was so happy, and I’m still happy. I can’t describe it.”

On Edgware Road, an Arab commercial hub in London, people wrapped in Moroccan and Amazigh, or Berber, flags ululated with joy and honked car horns after the game.

Ali Eleneez, a shopkeeper from Iraq, said he felt a sense of kinship watching alongside Moroccan friends and other fans.

“The Moroccan team made us proud. They made Arabs proud in general,” he said. “Despite any differences and despite everything, football brought people together. Honestly, it was more fantastic.”

Krystle Barry, a British Egyptian waitress, agreed. “It’s an out-of-the-ordinary joy,” she said. “We’re backing Morocco of course. … People from different countries are so happy, it’s as if we won.”

“It’s been a really nice atmosphere, and when Morocco won, people went wild,” said Mona Hamze, whose family owns a Lebanese restaurant. They gave out candy to celebrate, she added.

In France, people from the Moroccan diaspora and soccer enthusiasts descended on city streets, including Paris’s renowned Champs-Élysées, on Tuesday night. The sounds of dancing and singing rang out in city centers. Videos on social media showed fireworks in the skies of Strasbourg, Rennes and Montpellier.

Local officials and media said there were a few disturbances during celebrations in Nice and Lille but no reports of major damage.

The victory also took on a geopolitical dimension.

Some tweeted that Morocco’s players had “crushed the colonial supremacy of Spain,” the country’s former colonizer along with France, while others quipped about a return of “al-Andalus,” the Arabic term for the Muslim-ruled Iberian Peninsula centuries ago.

Today, Spain is home to hundreds of thousands of Moroccans. After the game, fans filled the streets of Barcelona and other cities waving flags and setting off flares.

“Today’s win is extra special for Moroccans in Spain — who are forever ‘immigrants’ despite their status as Spaniards,” tweeted Arab American social commentator and law professor Khaled Beydoun. He hailed the win as a “revolutionary rebuttal” for “marginalized” people across the world.

Beydoun, who said he watched the game live in Doha, told The Washington Post that a “residue of colonial rulership” still exists between the two nations off the pitch, which can be apparent for many immigrant diasporas in Europe.

But he also said he feared the win could spark trouble in some quarters of Europe where populism is on the rise, furthering the “narrative that Moroccans aren’t bona fide Spaniards” as a result of their “affinity to their ancestral homeland when it comes to sport.”

As Morocco’s victory reverberated around Europe, it also sparked a display of Arab solidarity, as people from Beirut to Gaza rallied around the Moroccan win.

On social media, many shared videos of the final goal that brought viewers to their feet in refugee camps in northern Syria and in crowds watching from Riyadh and Yemen. They clapped as Morocco’s players rushed to kiss their mothers in the stands, performed a gratitude bow of Muslim prayer on the pitch, and waved a Palestinian flag.

Leaders in the region also shared their excitement.

“Congratulations to the Atlas lions, you delighted us. Wow Morocco, you did it again!” tweeted Jordan’s Queen Rania.

Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah sent his “warmest congratulations to the brotherly Moroccan people.” Qatar’s emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, watched the game live, waving a Moroccan flag as people flooded downtown Doha to celebrate.

On the streets of Rabat and Casablanca, fans cheered and blocked central squares, while Moroccan King Mohammed VI extended his “heartfelt congratulations” to the players for their “historic” win.

Morocco is now the last African team in the international tournament. Once the euphoria subsides, it will take on another soccer heavyweight, Portugal, on Saturday.

States are joining the TikTok crackdown

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been pushing for years to ban federal government workers from downloading TikTok on their devices, with limited success.

The campaign has come amid broader regulatory scrutiny over whether the popular video-sharing app poses national security risks, a charge the company has fought back against.

Now a growing number of state officials are picking up the effort.

In the past week, North Dakota and Maryland have banned the use of TikTok on some government devices.

Last Tuesday, Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem signed an executive order banning TikTok on the devices of state government agencies, employees and contractors. Noem said “South Dakota will have no part in the intelligence gathering operations of nations who hate us” — an apparent reference to China, where TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is based.

On Tuesday, Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued an emergency directive barring use of what his office called “Chinese and Russian-influenced products,” including TikTok, in the executive branch of Maryland’s government. Hogan said the move — which also targets products from Huawei, ZTE, WeChat and Kaspersky — “represents a critical step in protecting Maryland State systems from the cybersecurity threats caused by foreign organizations.”

At least two other states, Nebraska and South Carolina, have partially blocked or are exploring blocking the app for state workers, the Associated Press reports.

And more could soon be on the way — particularly in states led by Republicans, who have in many cases been driving the push to restrict the app’s use more broadly.

Six of Wisconsin’s members of Congress, including outspoken TikTok critic Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, on Tuesday called on their governor to “ban TikTok from Wisconsin government devices and to lead by example and delete TikTok from your own devices.”

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has also targeted state procurement of technology products and services like TikTok with links to “foreign countries of concern.”

TikTok spokesperson Jamal Brown said they “believe the concerns driving these bans are largely fueled by misinformation about our company.”

“We are always happy to meet with state policymakers to discuss our privacy and security practices,” Brown said in an emailed statement. “We are disappointed that the many state agencies, offices, and universities that have been using TikTok to build communities and connect with constituents will no longer have access to our platform.”

The efforts have been fueled by government concerns that the Chinese government could gain access to U.S. user data through TikTok’s links to China as a ByteDance subsidiary. While the state-level restrictions won’t apply to consumer use, they still deal a blow to the company and could foreshadow further restrictions.

TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas testified to Congress in September that the company has employees based in China who are subject to “very strict access controls around the type of data that they can access and where that data is stored, which is here in the United States.”

Pappas also said that “under no circumstances would we give that data to China.”

Parallel efforts to ban TikTok from federal government devices are ongoing.

In 2020, the House voted in favor of the move as part of its annual massive defense spending package, but it was not ultimately signed into law.

A measure led by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) seeking to enshrine similar restrictions advanced out of the Senate Homeland Security Committee in May 2021 but has yet to be taken up.

The Biden administration is currently reviewing a potential deal to assuage the government’s data privacy and security concerns.

But the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that a potential agreement “has run into more delays” amid “a range of concerns, including how TikTok might share information related to the algorithm it uses to determine what videos to show users.”

Meanwhile, top U.S. officials have continued to voice concerns about the social network, with FBI Director Chris Wray saying last week that TikTok’s recommendation algorithm “allows them to manipulate content, and if they want to, to use it for influence operations.”

“These state-level actions coupled with FBI Director Chris Wray’s recent public comments … make it increasingly difficult to see how the Biden administration can conclude its ongoing review in a way that allows TikTok to keep operating,” Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who has publicly called for the app to be banned in the United States, told me.

But some prominent intelligence officials, including the head of a British intelligence agency, have pushed back on those concerns. And while numerous politicians have assailed the company’s risks, dozens of candidates on both sides of the political aisle have used the app for campaigning.

Major brands advertised on white nationalists’ Twitter pages

Advertisements by at least three dozen brands — including Amazon, Snap, Uber and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — appeared on the pages of at least two white nationalists, Andrew Anglin and Patrick Casey, my colleague Faiz Siddiqui reports. Accounts of Anglin and Casey had previously been banned on the platform, but they were restored after Twitter owner Elon Musk took control of the company in late October.

“Having ads inadvertently appear next to such content marks the latest challenge to Musk’s relationship with Twitter advertisers,” Faiz writes. Many brands have left the site, and civil rights groups have said advertisers should boycott it because Musk — who has recently promised amnesty to many previously suspended accounts — can’t adequately police the site.

“Twitter and other social media companies for years have struggled to ensure advertisements do not show up alongside hateful or otherwise objectionable content,” Faiz writes. “Twitter had made efforts to improve the advertising climate and continued to grapple with the issue even prior to Musk’s takeover.”

Oversight Board tells Facebook to revamp its moderation program for VIPs

In a report, the board criticized Facebook’s “cross check” program for being understaffed, opaque and unfair, the Wall Street Journal’s Jeff Horwitz reports.

“The board’s report doesn’t take issue with the value of a secondary review system for moderating posts from high-profile or sensitive accounts,” Horwitz writes. “But the board said the program in practice has put Meta’s business interests over the program’s stated goals of protecting public discourse, and it noted that the highest levels of protection are generally reserved for accounts that might stir up trouble for Meta’s senior leadership.”

Facebook parent Meta said it has made changes that align with the board’s recommendations, and that it already asked the board for advice on polishing the program, Horwitz reports. “The company has agreed to provide a more robust response within 90 days,” he writes.

Microsoft executives expected to meet with FTC commissioners

Microsoft President Brad Smith and other executives are expected to attend a meeting today with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and other commissioners, Bloomberg News’s Leah Nylen reports. The meetings, first reported by the New York Post, come as the FTC barrels toward making a decision on whether to block Microsoft’s proposed $69 billion deal to buy gaming giant Activision Blizzard.

This week, Smith previewed Microsoft’s arguments in an op-ed on the deal. Sony has argued that the deal would give video game developers and consumers less choice by making major gaming franchises potentially exclusive to Microsoft’s Xbox platform. In his op-ed, Smith argued that making games exclusive like that would be “economically irrational,” writing that such a move would be “disastrous” in “alienating millions of gamers.”

A Microsoft spokesperson and FTC spokesman Douglas Farrar declined to comment to Bloomberg News.

In my dreams, my dad is alive. He appears beside me in the grocery store clutching a list of items he wants me to purchase for him. They’re always things that suit his esoteric taste but are difficult to find in Missouri, like teff flour or broccoli rabe. Or he calls me with complaints about the loud neighbors at his independent-living facility. But when I try to dial the manager to sort things out, the numbers on my phone start melting.

My dad died this past March, when my sister and I made the decision to withdraw life support after an unsuccessful cardiac procedure. I scattered his ashes beside the Pacific Ocean this spring.

In some Buddhist traditions, bardo, the liminal state between one incarnation and the next, is said to last up to 49 days. But it’s been six months, and my dreams still involve explaining to my dad that he’s dead. He’s incredulous. Once my sister was in the dream too, and I called on her for backup: “Zoe, Dad’s dead, right?” He always did accept truths from her that he wouldn’t from me.

RELATED STORIES A Son’s Decision to Help His Father Die On the obligation to prevent people from dying alone Waking up from these dreams I feel something familiar: relief. It’s like swimming upward to a place where I can breathe again. I think Dad keeps returning to me in dreams because I feel guilty that my life is easier now that he’s gone. “The dreaded freedom.” That’s what my friend Catey Terry called it when I told her my dad had died. Most friends had guessed, even if I hadn’t told them, that my dad had challenges. He had suffered from mental illness for most of his life and had moved to be closer to me five years prior as his overall health deteriorated. I was grateful for Catey’s phrase because it was my first indication that it was okay to feel anything other than sadness about his death. Catey had cared for her mother through a brutal decline into dementia, so she knew that death can mean many things, not all of them bad. “Grief and Relief: Is it wrong to feel relieved when someone dies?” is the title of an online video by psychotherapist Joe Walz that caught my attention during a late-night Googling session. While speaking to Walz for this piece, I learned research indicates that relief is an extremely common reaction caregivers have to the death of a loved one who had dementia. But he noted that similar feelings may appear in those whose parents experienced other struggles particular to aging. “It’s very natural to think, ‘Hey, I don’t have to change my parent’s diaper anymore; I don’t have to do all these painful, time-consuming, tiring things,’ ” Walz told me.

Why hadn’t I heard this before? All I knew about grief was what had filtered into the popular imagination based on the work of psychologist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross — that it has five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. Litsa Williams, a clinical social worker, told me that the first thing I need to know about the “stages of grief” is that “they’re not real.” Kübler-Ross observed the stages in people diagnosed with terminal illnesses in relation to their own deaths, not in those dealing with others’ deaths. “I think people like the stages,” Williams said, “because it takes something incredibly complex and overwhelming and difficult, and makes it neat and tidy, like, ‘Oh, it’s just going to be these little five stages, and it ends in acceptance.’ ” The popular understanding of these stages, she said, may lead people to feel that they are “grieving wrong.”

Williams, who started the website What’s Your Grief with a colleague, calls relief “the unspoken grief emotion.” She explained that relief is a common part of grieving, especially for those who have been involved in caregiving for the person who died. If someone had mental health problems, like my father did, their death can allow survivors to “exhale from that hypervigilance, worrying the worst is always coming.” She said people may think, “God, what does it say about me that I’ve wanted this person to die?” But in fact, “when we peel it back … if they could have waved a wand and fixed the relationship, the mental illness, the addiction, that’s what they would have wanted.”

“I’m sorry” is the most common response when people hear that a parent has died, and some variation on “Thank you, it’s really sad” is a frequent reply. But “sad” does not begin to cover the complexity of what many adult children feel when parents die. I was sorry my dad died, and I was not sorry. Yet I had few models for these feelings.

By the time I came along, my father had already had a difficult life. He grew up in a working-class family in Bridgeport, Conn. He was an intellectual and a poet in a neighborhood where men were judged on how well they could throw a punch. He struggled to be accepted by his alcoholic father. As a teenager, my dad fell into a depression that would chase him his whole life. The health-care system being what it was in the 1950s, he was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and sent to a mental institution, where he received electroconvulsive therapy that erased much of his memory of his childhood.

Whether it was a result of this trauma or related to his late-in-life diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, my dad oscillated during my lifetime between what the Institute for Challenging Disorganization would classify as Level 1 and Level 3 hoarding. In my childhood home, I wended my way between piles of newspapers that narrowed the hallways. There was a room full of empty bottles that we called the Plain of Jars. Over 20 years, he carefully saved a garbage bag full of plastic forks and spoons — for a picnic with a thousand of his friends, we joked.

He couldn’t save his marriage to my mom, but he could save the Sonny Rollins record she bought him for his birthday in 1983, still wrapped, for 30 years. He couldn’t prevent me and my sister from leaving home, but he could save the plastic barrettes that had fallen from our hair into the green shag carpet, in a jar with marbles, rusty paper clips and orphaned keys.

My dad was a brilliant, funny, gentle person. His heroes were Malcolm X and Charles Darwin, and he read everything from poet Sharon Olds to the Federalist Papers, which was the book he brought to the hospital with him the day he died. When I was a teenager, we’d take the train into New York together; we saw Edward Hopper at the Whitney Museum and Shakespeare in the Park. His expectations for me were high: For my 14th birthday, he gave me German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra.” I would need to know, he said, how to confront what he called “the ultimate question” — how to relate to death.

If the stereotypical father is stern and withholding, my dad was vulnerable to a fault. When I was growing up, I didn’t know it was unusual that he confided in me about his loneliness. In fact, I felt special. He told me we were different from other people, honest beyond social conventions. But I wondered later whether I had needed to know, as a teenager, that his antidepressants lowered his libido. Was it okay for him to ask me, as a college student, to open a credit card account that he could transfer his debts to? Was it normal that I spent summers in my 20s secretly taking loads of garbage from his house to the dumpster behind CVS?

As I entered adulthood, I kept in close touch with Dad. I wrote him postcards from Chiang Mai and Berlin, and I felt his pride that I’d done the things he’d always wanted to — travel, get a PhD, build a stable family. He sent me multiple one-line emails every day, each with a foreboding subject line: Capitalism. My Mortality. Licorice Panna Cotta.

But once my husband, Sean, and I had settled down in a Midwestern college town and had kids, my worries about Dad increased. He’d had a heart attack in his 50s and triple bypass surgery in his 60s, and his mother and brother had both had dementia. By then in his mid-70s, he complained of loneliness every time I spoke with him. He was still living in the house he and my mother had bought when I was a baby, surrounded by 40 years of accumulated detritus. I couldn’t bear for him to die there, surrounded by dirty dishes and stacks of AOL.com free-trial discs, his body undiscovered for days. After years of resisting my pleas, Dad left Connecticut, his lifelong home, in the summer of 2017. We found him an apartment around the corner from us and helped him move in his boxfuls of newspapers dating back to the ’80s and his collection of sample-size tubes of toothpaste in various stages of use.

Thus began the hardest years of my life. Until then, Dad had been unfailingly gentle with me, albeit persistently melancholy. The person who arrived in Missouri was desperately unhappy, fragile and belligerent. I couldn’t tell if these changes reflected cognitive decline, resulted from underlying health problems, or stemmed from the unsettling move. Whatever the cause, I felt like I had a gained a third child, in addition to the 3- and 5-year-old we already had. Dad told me I had ruined his life. He delayed buying a car due to financial worries, expecting that Sean and I would share our one vehicle with him. He’d sometimes knock on our door at 10 p.m., saying he felt anxious, and insist on sleeping over. He always wanted to move in with us, but I didn’t think my solid-but-strained-by-circumstances marriage could withstand Dad’s constant presence. My sister did the best she could to help from afar, but I was overwhelmed. I had just started a new job, and my life felt like an exhausting jigsaw of demands punctuated by repetitive arguments.

The only time Dad was happy and relaxed was when he was with his grandkids. He found library books to read to them that matched their interests, spelling out difficult words just as he’d done for me and my sister. He let my son beat him at soccer, 1 million to 6. He found educational videos about the science of farts and the fastest animals on Earth. I got to glimpse the parent he’d been to me further back than I could remember, and my heart broke with tenderness.

Then his health problems escalated, and in the summer of 2020 he had a stroke that affected his mobility and made driving dangerous. I followed his doctors’ advice to secure him a place in an independent-living facility, which he despised. Although he was offended when I suggested there had been cognitive changes as well, he constantly lost track of his wallet, phone, keys and medications; he forgot how a gas burner worked. He got angry when I tried to help, and he got angry when I didn’t help enough. I gritted my teeth and did my best. I picked him up for dinner, a concert or a kid’s sporting event twice a week. With a few horrible exceptions, I spoke to him patiently. When I woke up in the night, my thoughts inevitably turned to him. When was the last time he had taken a shower? How could I persuade him to agree to a cognitive evaluation? How long was all this going to last? Was it wrong to even think about that?

In the last years of my dad’s life, I sometimes felt alone with the difficulties of caring for him. But my experience wasn’t unique. As soon as I started mentioning “relief” and “parent’s death” in the same sentence, friends’ stories came pouring out. Catey Terry, 60, described her mother in her younger years as “a lovely person” who was “dedicated to being a mom.” “She shopped at Talbots,” Catey explained, conveying the put-togetherness of a generation of women born in the first half of the 20th century. But dementia rendered Catey’s mom nearly unrecognizable. Nursing home staff would call Catey with the news that her mother was throwing planters over the fence or pulling pictures off the walls. “She was dangerous to herself and others,” Catey recalled. “I could deal with it, but I just knew how much she would have hated it. … You don’t wish anybody dead, but I wished peace for her, and peace was not the way she was living.”

When Catey’s mother died in 2018, she, her sisters and her husband were “just relieved.” But this didn’t make the loss any less devastating. “I still say good night to her every night and tell her I love her,” said Catey, tearing up.

The trauma Catey experienced was based partly on the sharp contrast between her happy, stable upbringing and her mother’s distressing transformation. People who have been taking care of their parents for a lifetime have a different journey. I talked with a college friend, Oriana Walker, who had lost both of her parents by the time she was 35. She described her parents as “pretty hardcore hippie seekers” who disavowed traditional medicine. When she was a baby, her father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and her mother insisted on caring for him at home even as he lost mobility. From a young age, Oriana was dressing her father and brushing his teeth, and eventually feeding him. By the time he died when Oriana was in her early 30s, he could only move his head. “The whole trajectory [of his illness] was incredibly exhausting,” she said. “That’s where the guilt starts. … You don’t want to feel how exhausting it is. You want [the situation] to be workable.”

His death was the only way out of the excruciating dynamics that had warped our relationship. But Oriana’s caregiving duties did not end. Her mother, who had devoted decades to caring for Oriana’s father, had left her own metastatic breast cancer untreated. Just as Oriana was trying to finish her PhD — not coincidentally, in medical anthropology — she had to move back home. She described the months before her mother’s death as “a 24/7, crushing labor of caregiving.” Oriana questioned at the time how she would survive the experience. “It was like a life-and-death struggle we were in, and it was going to be me or her. She would either eat me alive, or I wouldn’t allow it and she would die. … We were like three dominoes in a line. First my dad feeds off my mom, and then my mom feeds off me.” Oriana survived. After her mother’s death in 2016, once the physical exhaustion wore off, “it was an amazing feeling … one of the biggest gifts I’ve received ... like somebody pushed the reset button on my life.” It took years of therapy for her to accept these feelings and come to terms with her guilt about wanting a life independent of her parents’ illnesses.

Besides leaning on friends in similar situations, the most helpful thing I did in the year before my dad’s death was go to counseling with him. Our therapist, the skilled James Hunter of the Employee Assistance Program at the University of Missouri, listened to my dad’s complaints — that I had imprisoned him in the independent-living facility, that I didn’t buy him the right kind of butter (unsalted!) — and then said something that shocked both of us: I needed to be doing less for my dad, not more.

Enmeshment, Hunter explained, was a relationship lacking boundaries that can emerge when parent and child roles are blurred or reversed, often due to mental illness or trauma. This had begun when I was a teenager and intensified in the past several years. To heal, we had to differentiate. I had to step back. Dad had to get on Instacart and order his own butter.

Emboldened, I told my dad in a counseling session that I wasn’t responsible for his happiness. “What are you responsible for, then?” he demanded. His question made me wonder why I had willingly taken on that responsibility for so long. When I asked my dad why he thought we spent so much time in counseling talking about his feelings and so little talking about mine, his jaw dropped as if the answer were obvious: “Because I’m the vulnerable one!” Although I was his child, he couldn’t see that I was vulnerable, too.

When I asked Joe Walz about enmeshment and how it affects reactions to a parent’s death, he told me how fortunate I was to have started unraveling this dynamic before my dad died: “When people have started recognizing the problematic nature of the relationship and started doing their own work with friends, family members or their own therapist … they’re probably in a better position. Even though it’d be very painful when that death happens, they will find that relief,” because they “finally have that room, that opportunity and that necessity to become [their] own person more fully.”

And for those who didn’t have the precious chance to get a neutral observer’s view of their relationship with a parent, Walz noted that it’s never too late. “Don’t feel guilty,” he said. “Be open to talking to a therapist.” And in analyzing your own actions, “just be really gentle and forgiving.”

Die at the right time,” Nietzsche wrote in the book Dad had given me when I was a teenager. But Dad never wanted to die. He feared death more than anyone I knew; the loss of control reminded him of electroshock therapy. He was a hypochondriac who also happened to have a lot of health problems, and so his death had been a frequent topic of conversation. “You brought me to Missouri to die,” he’d tell me accusingly, as if he’d have been immortal had he stayed in Connecticut. But in a way he was right. I hadn’t wanted him to die alone, thousands of miles from me, food rotting in his fridge. And my plan worked: When the hospital called one Wednesday afternoon in March, I was only 10 minutes away.

“Low.” That was how the cardiologist answered my question about Dad’s chances of survival. He’d gone into the hospital that morning for a planned cardiac ablation, but his blood pressure had dropped during the procedure. At 81, his body turned out to be too fragile for such an intervention. His brain had been deprived of oxygen for too long to be able to return to its previous functionality.

“You can ask yourself what your father would have wanted,” the doctor said. “Would he be ready to let go?” Despite the gravity of the moment, I almost laughed. I thought of the newspapers, the toothpaste tubes, the plastic forks. No, he was not “ready to let go.” But was I? I called my sister, Zoe. As a nurse, she had seen these situations before, and she was clear: “Just make him comfortable and let him go.”

The doctors were happy to, as they put it, “change the goals of care.” I stood at Dad’s bedside while they removed his ventilation tube and administered morphine. I noticed the soft fuzz of hair on his scalp; he’d asked me to take him for a haircut and I hadn’t had the chance. I wanted to reach out and pet his head, but the doctors were busy with their work. Suddenly I remembered being carried by him as a child, laying my head on his shoulder and holding on to his earlobe for comfort as we walked up the steps to the library. Now his skin looked waxy and gray. His body was swelled with excess fluids, and his ears were mashed against his head with tubing and tape. He did not look like himself.

I started to cry. “Dad, we love you. It’s okay to let go,” I whispered. “I’m right here with you.” It took longer than I thought it would. I worried that he was going to wake up and be mad at me for killing him. Then his heart beat one more time, and stopped.

“A good death,” as Atul Gawande calls it in “Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End,” is elusive. And the question is, good for whom? How to balance the needs of the elderly with those of their caretakers? There are no clear answers. Expectations around caring for aging parents vary according to culture and economic circumstances. Gawande’s book is one of the few that lays out the complex medical and social dynamics that surround aging and death, and one I’d recommend reading before your parents reach a medical crisis, when it’s easier to have a frank conversation.

But there are some things no book could have prepared me for. In the last years of my dad’s life, I felt like he was wearing a disturbing Halloween costume that he couldn’t take off. He was trapped, and I was trapped with him. His death was the only way out of the excruciating dynamics that had warped our relationship, the only way I could connect with the parent he was to me when he was still able.

I asked Litsa Williams about the dreams where my dad is still alive. When a relationship was more straightforward, she explained, such dreams can be accompanied by a pleasant sense of communion with the deceased. However, with more complicated relationships, the dreams often have an undertone of what Williams calls “Did I do enough?” “The brain hasn’t quite closed that loop,” she told me, and returns to difficult moments. We can “cut ourselves some slack,” she said, and realize that the wish for a parent’s death, or relief about it, “comes from a place of either compassion or self-compassion,” from “wanting the suffering to end,” both for you and your parent.

After my dad died, Zoe, Sean and I waded into the apartment full of his hoarded possessions. We recycled thousands of recipes he had carefully clipped from the New York Times. We donated a closetful of new apparel with tags still on, which he’d been saving for some unknown future in which he felt worthy of them, and we threw away the small collection of raggedy clothes he’d actually worn. I saved whatever I could, but it wasn’t much.

When I turned the key for the last time on that empty apartment, I thought I was finished. Now I know it will take much longer to sort through everything my dad left behind. But I’m moving forward, slowly. While I was writing this article, I had a new dream about my dad. He was his old self, sweet and gentle. When I woke up, I missed him.

371,A stranger called. He had photos of her family from the Holocaust era.,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Blanche Fixler survived the Holocaust because her aunt sent her to an orphanage when she was 6 as the Nazis invaded Europe during World War II. Her mother, grandmother and two older siblings were murdered with 450,000 other Jews in the Belzec extermination camp in Poland, and her father ended up at a labor camp in Siberia.

She moved to the United States after the war, and assumed all of her family mementos were long gone, especially since her family’s apartment in Krakow was ransacked by the Nazis during the German occupation.

Fixler, now 86 and living in New York, always wished she had photos from her earliest years of life.

Then in August, she received a phone call that stunned her: Someone had found two group photos that showed her as a little girl in France. One of the photos, taken just after the war ended, included her aunt and two cousins.

“It meant more than you could imagine,” said Fixler, who as a child was named Bronia Bruenner.

The call came from Daniel Patt, a software engineer for Google and the founder of a website called From Numbers to Names, which uses artificial intelligence to find old photographs of loved ones and relatives lost during the Holocaust.

“It was incredible that he took it upon himself to do this kind thing,” she said, adding that he hand-delivered the photos to her in New York in October.

Patt’s website has links to archives that contain about 500,000 photos from museums such as Yad Vashem — the World Holocaust Remembrance Center and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Anyone can upload a photo of a Holocaust victim or survivor to the site, and it will compare the photo to its archives.

“A search might lead to never-before-seen photos of a loved one,” said Patt, 40, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. “It’s a way to bring that person back to them and feel that they’re still with them in some way.”

“Everyone can do a quick scan of 34,000 photos in the archives in about five seconds,” said Patt, noting that special request searches are also done once a day to compare faces to all 500,000 photos.

“It’s too cost-prohibitive right now for everyone to search all 500,000 images every time they come to the website,” he said.

Patt did a search for photos of Fixler after he spotted a museum post on Twitter from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum about her that included an old photo of her with her aunt.

“I decided to run the photo through the site and found two World War II-era photos for Blanche,” he said.

He then tracked down her phone number and called her to tell her what he found. When he showed her the pictures, she confirmed they were indeed her and her family.

''It was a special and unforgettable day,” Patt said. “Blanche sang a little song she remembered from the orphanage after she saw the photos.”

Patt said he was inspired to start From Numbers to Names after a 2016 visit to the POLIN Jewish history museum in Poland, where his ancestors are from.

“Three of my grandparents are Holocaust survivors,” he said. “And to the best of our knowledge, my great-grandfather was locked in a synagogue and burned alive by the Nazis.”

As he looked at museum walls covered with photos of Jewish families whose lives were torn apart by the Nazi regime, Patt said he kept wondering about the faces in the frames.

“I thought, ‘Am I looking at photos of some of my family members without even realizing it?’” he said. “It occurred to me that with the technology we have today, we might be able to find matches to photos from museums around the world.”

Patt launched From Numbers to Names in April 2021 and began downloading photos from Holocaust museum collections when he came across them online.

“It’s simple to use and it’s free,” he said, noting that he plans to add more archives to the site as they’re made available.

Fixler said it was only because of her aunt, Rosa Berger, that she survived the Holocaust.

She was sent to live with her aunt when she was 4 after deportations to concentration camps started in the Krakow ghetto. Fixler’s family took refuge in an underground bunker.

“My mother was afraid I would cry and give everyone away, so she had a good Samaritan take me to my aunt, who was living under a false name,” she said.

Fixler said she lived with her aunt on the outskirts of Krakow until the landlady of their apartment told German authorities that she suspected Rosa Berger was harboring a Jewish child.

“My aunt had beautiful blond hair and spoke good German, so they didn’t bother her,” she said. “But people wondered about me all the time.”

Nazi soldiers came to search Berger’s apartment several times, but her Aunt Rosa always managed to hide her, Fixler said.

When she was 6, she said her aunt hid her beneath a down quilt and a large board inside the bed.

“She would make the bed up nice and straight, then put another bedspread on top and I would lie there under the board, quiet as a mouse,” Fixler recalled. “I told myself, ‘If you breathe or sneeze or cough, you are dead.’”

When her Aunt Rosa decided the situation had become too dangerous, Fixler was shuttled between orphanages in Poland, Hungary and France. Her aunt, who had given birth during the war, came to live with her for a while at an orphanage outside Paris, she said.

One photo that turned up during Patt’s search shows Fixler living in a camp for displaced people in Barbizon, France, after World War II ended. Her father was eventually reunited with her and the pair immigrated to the United States.

“I had an instinct to live and I was not bitter from the war,” Fixler said, noting that her aunt eventually joined them in the United States.

“My aunt was my savior — I was able to survive because of her and God,” she said. “I’m very grateful to Daniel to have more photos from this period of my life.”

Patt said it is his honor to help survivors — and their descendants — find important links to the past.

“These are usually never-before-seen photos,” said Patt. “Each one brings some feeling of closeness to their loved ones.”

Patt recently helped actor Josh Gad find an early photo of his grandmother Evelyn Greenblatt, a Holocaust survivor who died in 2008. He stumbled upon an Instagram post Gad had written in 2018 about his grandparents and decided to look for additional photos, using the wedding photo Gad had posted.

Gad, known for his roles in “Frozen,” “Beauty and the Beast” and the comedy series “Avenue 5” on HBO Max, said his mother had been doing some research and came across another photo, this one a blurry picture of a woman she thought might be Greenblatt. Gad and his family wondered if it was his grandmother as a teenager.

“It was a photo my mom had found, but it was so distorted, we wouldn’t tell for sure whether it was her,” Gad said.

Patt ran the Greenblatts’ wedding photo through his website and located a clear version of the Evelyn Greenblatt photo Gad had wondered about. He then did a second search and found another photo featuring Gad’s great-grandmother, Sarah Rosenberg, who died in a concentration camp.

“My family and I were in tears when Daniel told us about the photos,” said Gad, 41. “To see these clear images was like traveling back in time. I was able to see my grandmother as a young woman, like the photo was taken yesterday.”

The photo of his grandmother wearing a Nazi-mandated Jewish badge on her coat also made his heart sink, he said.

“There was a realization that this photo of her was taken in the Jewish ghetto right before she was sent to the camps,” Gad said. “Her life was about to change forever because she was going to endure such horrors.”

Gad said he is grateful every day that his grandmother survived and was able to move forward with a happy and fulfilling life.

“Because of the Holocaust, many of us have been robbed of the opportunity to see images of families that were in many cases wiped out,” he said. “Thanks to Daniel and this new technology, we’re finally able to fill frames with photos that otherwise would not have been seen from this period of destruction and loss.”

Patt now spends most of his spare time on From Numbers to Names and receives help from about a dozen volunteers. He said he recently received a grant for an educational pilot project that will allow students to help his team locate more photos for families.

“The plan is for them to help compare all of the nearly 500,000 archived photos online with each other,” he said. “We want to take every single face in the archives and compare them to every other face in the collection in the hope of finding more names to go with the faces.”

He said that the more time he spends with the photographs, the more impactful his project becomes to him.

“I have a hard time coming up with words for what happened during the Holocaust,” Patt added. “It’s important to add faces to the numbers and share these photos with the world.”

372,Minnesota and Massachusetts are the best states for humans. And more!,"Department of Data Which states have the highest living standards? (And more!) Houses under construction this month in Menifee, Calif. (Kyle Grillot/Bloomberg News)

Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

It’s time to take a few steps back, build up a head of steam and dive headfirst into our favorite descriptive data sets and reader questions. Here’s the latest Data Dive! States with the highest living standards Two economists recently undertook the herculean effort of comparing living standards across all 50 states, and we here at the Department of Data are enormously grateful. Partly because it means we don’t have to do it ourselves. But mostly because the results are mesmerizing.

It turns out that the sultans of standards, the lords of living, are none other than … Massachusetts and Minnesota!

Those of you with a borderline-unhealthy addiction to state stats (which is to say probably our entire readership) may find this a bit surprising. After all, neither state has the highest income (that’s Connecticut). Nor do they have the highest life expectancy (California and Hawaii). Or even the most leisure time (Mississippi and West Virginia work the least). But Massachusetts and Minnesota have the best balance across a panel of metrics that, combined, give people a holistic sense of well-being.

The numbers come from a study just published in the journal International Economic Review by Federal Reserve Board senior economist Elena Falcettoni and University of Houston economist Vegard M. Nygaard. The two attempt to answer a simple question: If you could choose what state you were born into, but not your race, gender, income or education, which state would be most likely to give you the best life?

Department of Data We here at the Department of Data are dedicated to exploring the weird and wondrous power of the data that defines our world. Read more. In addition to the factors above, Falcettoni and Nygaard looked at education, inequality and spending. They also tested extensively to make sure the differences between states weren’t driven merely by the race, gender or education of their residents. One caveat: The data is a bit old — from 2013 to 2017 — because the figures are a hassle to collect and the economic-paper publishing process can be comically slow.

The findings reveal, as you might guess, that living standards tend to correlate with income. But income doesn’t explain all the differences: Hawaii has the fourth-lowest adjusted income in the country, but still manages to rank 13th in overall welfare because Hawaii residents tend to live longer, work less and enjoy a more equal society.

Meanwhile, Oklahoma — a respectable 23rd in income — is third from the bottom in overall well-being because it scores so poorly on life expectancy and education. The other bottom-ranked states are, for the record, the Deep South duo of Alabama and Mississippi (50th).

As a rule, high-income states that want to improve their ranking would do well to increase welfare by reducing the cost of living — for example, by making housing more affordable. Low-income states would be better off focusing on educating folks and raising life expectancy through public health efforts to discourage smoking, prevent gun deaths or improve environmental quality.

Owners vs. agents: Who sells it best?

Do for-sale-by-owner sellers do better than sellers who hire a real estate agent?

— Atul Rai in Wichita

Killer question! Agents definitely are winning in the marketplace: 90 percent of home sellers use an agent, according to the National Association of Realtors. Of the remainder, fewer than half are true for-sale-by-owner listings; most are sales between friends and family members.

Does that mean almost all of us are leaving tens of thousands of dollars on the table when we sell our homes, perhaps the highest-stakes financial transaction of our lives?

Apparently, yes!

When three economists built a mammoth database tracking more than 2.2 million real estate transactions from 2000 to 2019, they found that owners consistently beat agents on sales price.

Owners reeled in 1 to 4.3 percent more for similar properties than agents did, depending on the market. And that’s before you consider that owners also are saving up to 3 percent by not paying a commission to a listing agent.

All told, the economists calculate that owners saved around $20,000 on a typical home sale, which averaged around $280,000 during the period studied.

Advertisement

The economists — Lily Shen of Clemson University, and Chris Cunningham and Kristopher Gerardi of the Atlanta Fed — focused on three major markets (Minneapolis, Houston and Charlotte) where they could use the multiple listing service (MLS) to track the performance of 16,000 individual agents. They also scoured companies in each metro area to figure out which were full-service Realtors such as ReMax and Century 21 and which were “flat fee” brokers, who provide few services beyond listing a property on the MLS.

They found your choice of agent can have tremendous consequences. Switching from one of the worst (fifth percentile) listing agents to one of the best (95th percentile) would increase the sales price of your home by 15 to 20 percent. But only the very best agents were able to beat owners selling their own property.

In case you’re curious, the pattern among agents who represent buyers is similar to the pattern among selling agents: A top buying agent will negotiate a price 17 percent lower than one of their least-successful peers.

But the study found that it can be tough to identify these super-agents. Neither their seniority nor the size of their firm are predictive of their performance. In fact, more experienced listing agents appear to get slightly lower prices for their clients, both because they’re spreading their effort over a larger base of clients and because they tend to sell homes faster so they can move on to the next commission.

To be sure, the fine folks at the National Association of Realtors, which represents almost 1.6 million real estate agents nationwide, are skeptical of these findings. Troy Green, the association’s media and communications director, points out that a real estate agent provides services beyond just getting the highest price. He said the association’s own “data indicates that when a home seller tries to go at it alone, they tend to lose out on potential value for their homes.”

“There are benefits to working with an agent in addition to sales price and time on market,” Green told us, including “saving the seller’s time and minimizing disruption, advice on pricing, market knowledge and other valuable services.”

Best jobs for older workers

American jobs have grown much age-friendlier, a clever new analysis finds, evolving in ways disproportionately favored by older workers. They offer more flexible hours, for example, or demand less physical exertion.

That’s the good news. The less-good news? Older workers haven’t been the biggest beneficiaries of this age-friendly job bonanza. More on that soon.

Advertisement

Age-friendliness is hard to define and measure — after all, workers of all ages would like to set their own schedule and avoid backbreaking physical activity. So how did economists Daron Acemoglu and Nicolaj Mühlbach of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Andrew Scott of London Business School pull it off? (Mühlbach, who worked at MIT at the time of this research, now works as an analytics associate at McKinsey and Co.)

They began with the results of an earlier, separate survey of about 1,800 American workers that, among many other factoids, pinpointed which job qualities older workers valued higher than their younger peers. In particular, workers age 62 and older were significantly more willing to accept a smaller paycheck if a job involved moderate physical activity, more time sitting and the autonomy to choose how to do their job.

“Everyone may like the contours of these jobs, but certain types might be prepared to take a job or an even lower wage because they like it much, much more,” said Scott, co-author of “The 100-Year Life: Living and Working in an Age of Longevity.” Firms should find that, if they offer the right perks, older Americans will accept less pay than younger workers would for those jobs.

They distilled those perks into plain-language descriptions of characteristics such as pace, autonomy, paid time off and teamwork. With a language-processing algorithm, they compared those descriptions to a monumental federal database that divides the U.S. economy into more than 1,000 jobs and painstakingly enumerates the precise responsibilities and skills required for each. For example, animal breeders should be ready to “clip or shear hair on animals” and “maintain logs of semen specimens used and animals bred” and will need independence, self-control and “arm-hand steadiness.”

By matching broad preferences with detailed tasks, the economists could score every job on an index of age-friendliness. When all was said and done, the most age-friendly jobs in 2020 included guides, ticket and reservation agents, receptionists and information clerks, and advertising and sales positions. The least-age-friendly jobs included concrete and cement work, carpenters, painters and masons.

In general, the jobs held by older workers tend to involve fewer physical demands and hazards, as well as lower output in terms of widgets produced or tasks accomplished. They also tend to require more communication but offer more recognition, such as leadership or prestige, and better working conditions.

Since 1990, the economists estimate, the economy has added about 49 million jobs with above-average age-friendliness. That’s largely because 3 in 4 jobs have changed in ways that benefit older workers, but also because the types of jobs that are age-friendly have grown faster than the types of jobs that don’t favor older workers.

The biggest beneficiaries of this shift, however, have been women with college degrees regardless of age. Workers over 50 without college degrees — particularly men — have been left behind.

“Whilst older workers have the greater preference for these jobs, they do also appeal to women — and graduates in particular,” Scott said.

Older men may also feel they’re locked into less-age-friendly jobs by the skills they’ve acquired over decades. For example, a master carpenter — who probably makes quite a good wage — may not be ready or able to abandon that mastery and take age-friendly work as a guide or proofreader.

373,"With Morocco leading, the World Cup tide is tilting against Europe","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

For most of the time that we’ve heard of it, soccer’s World Cup has been, in name and reality, a misnomer. It wasn’t about the world, per se. It was about Europe — and its colonialization of the world. Want World Cup news as it happens? Download The Post’s app and turn on alert notifications for Sports and Breaking News. ArrowRight Italy. France. Spain. Portugal. England, of course. And all the colonies and places to which Europe exported the game, not in some noble effort but to impose European aesthetics and sensibilities. In South American countries including, most notably, Brazil and Argentina. Asian nations Japan and Korea. African footholds south of the Sahara in West Africa. And countries north of the Sahara, such as Morocco, which on Tuesday in Qatar dispatched its last European colonizer, Spain, and advanced to the quarterfinals — only the sixth team from outside Europe or South America to do so in the tournament’s history.

And Morocco, the Atlas Lions, did so off the boot of Achraf Hakimi — born to Moroccan parents in Spain and reared in Spain, who historically would have been expected to play for Spain — on a third penalty kick after a scoreless draw. Spain missed all of its tries.

Morocco freed itself from Spanish rule in 1956 after 44 years. On Tuesday, it represented a new liberation movement in global sport.

For as Michael Murphy, a Queen’s University political scientist reminded in a recent paper on soccer in Africa, the game was “introduced into the African colonies by the Western capitalist colonial powers in an effort to make manageable the populations of the newly conquered territories. To make manageable the populations meant to introduce soccer ‘with the purpose of satisfying colonial ideas of and needs for order and discipline among the dominated population.’ ”

There remained plenty of remnants of European settler colonialism in this World Cup, Morocco’s breakthrough notwithstanding. The tournament continued to spotlight European soccer’s harvesting of the best talent from beyond its shores to feed its rapacious appetite for the game within its borders. You were hard-pressed to spy a European side without a progeny of an African country it once occupied. I couldn’t help but feel the pain for Breel Embolo when he gestured in apology after scoring for Switzerland against his birth country Cameroon.

“Therein lies the rub,” emailed Grant Farred, a Cornell professor of Africana Studies and English who has penned his love of soccer: “The ghosts of globalization, of forced migration, the refugee, the aspirant postcolonial type seeking greener, that is, European, pastures, whose sons are now wearing the colors of what was once an imperial flag. The contradictions abound.

“Why is it,” Farred asked, “that the Cameroonian lays to waste Cameroon?”

After all, it is rare that a European pummels his European birthplace, though it has happened. The great German striker Miroslav Klose was born in Poland.

But if ever a World Cup hinted that the tide was turning a bit, that the playing pitch was being evened, it is this one. And how apropos, given it is being allowed to grace the Middle East for the first time. After being in Africa for the first time in 2010, in a liberated South Africa. After being in Asia for the first time in 2002, in Japan and South Korea.

The World Cup, indeed, should play upon the world stage and not just one continent or two. And it should be a celebration of the world’s athletes, not just those in Europe. This World Cup got closer to that ideal.

To be sure, when this World Cup entered its knockout round of 16 on Saturday, all six populated continents were represented for the first time. That included two teams from Africa — Senegal and Morocco — and two teams from Asia, Japan and South Korea, where British sailors are thought to have planted the game in the late 19th century.

Australia also advanced to the round of 16. Only five teams from outside of Europe and South America made the quarterfinals before Morocco. And no team from outside Europe or South America has played in a World Cup final. Last weekend kicked off the best chance for that breakthrough to be made, which made this World Cup the most diverse and inclusive of all.

There is no doubt that the rest of the world’s rising success in the world’s most popular sport is due to more of that talent long gathered by Europe from points beyond its border playing now for its birthplace, or origin, rather than for a European colonist from which that birthplace may have liberated itself, often in brutal struggles. For example, Ghana’s Thomas Partey is said to have a Spanish passport but has continued to represent his birth country, the first African nation to free itself from British rule, in the World Cup. And more frequently now, foreign-born players of African descent, such as Spanish-born Inaki Williams, are choosing to play for their ancestral homes. Williams dressed for Ghana, too.

Williams is one of more than 130 players in this World Cup playing for a country other than that of their birth. Most of those suited up for one of the African continent’s five teams.

For many, it seems like a newfound sense of nationalism. Williams’s mother, as he has told the story, was pregnant with him when she fled Ghana, crossing the Sahara barefoot all the way to Spain. His younger brother Nico, however, who was born in Pamplona, starred for the Spanish side that Morocco’s Spanish-born players helped eliminate Tuesday.

In soccer, the chickens are finally coming home to roost.

374,"With a roaring World Cup moment, Morocco rolls to the quarterfinals","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

RAYYAN, Qatar — One of those shared experiences both goalless and breathless wound its way through the hours and all the way to thunderous noise Tuesday night, noise that cried out for a Richter scale as it mushroomed from the fan base that leads this World Cup in decibels per capita.

It came from the droves of Moroccans who have traveled here for this first World Cup in the Arab world, and it soundtracked their team’s uncommon mastery of penalty kicks — and of stopping same. Morocco will play in its first World Cup quarterfinal because it followed a 0-0 draw against Spain by knocking in three of its four penalty tries as its Canada-born, Morocco-raised and Spain-based 31-year-old goalkeeper, Yassine Bounou, known to his millions of new friends as Bono, thwarted two Spanish bids, with a third hitting the post.

His last stop set up Spain-born, Paris-based Moroccan star defender Achraf Hakimi on the cusp of victory, and when Hakimi nudged his penalty kick straight ahead as Spanish goalkeeper Unai Simón flailed to his right, the waiting Moroccan players went charging down the pitch toward Hakimi and Bono with the kind of exhilaration normally reserved for daydreams.

HAKIMI WINS IT FOR MOROCCO



MOROCCO IS MOVING ON 🇲🇦 pic.twitter.com/zlA17MUgJa — FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) December 6, 2022

They hugged like mad. They bowed in the sujud posture. They became the fourth African team and the first Arab team ever to reach the World Cup quarterfinals, with the chance to become the first to go further Saturday against Portugal, as Manager Walid Regragui hopes for further noise from “Algerian people, Tunisian people, Arabic people and African people.”

“I’d like to thank all the players,” Bono said, “who have helped us lift and go through this mountainous task. Great effort. Great effort. I applaud them, and I give this joy to the Moroccan people.”

“If you told me at the beginning of the tournament we are going to play against these top teams without losing a match and without giving away a goal, I would have signed straightaway,” said Regragui, his team having drawn with Croatia and beaten Belgium, Canada and Spain.

Spain, which knows its way to the backs of nets, never did find its way there, another accomplishment for the hard, hard Moroccan defense. The lone goal any side has mustered in any match with Morocco went to Canada, and it doubled as the lone own goal of the whole tournament, so you might just construe it as an act of generosity. The entire Moroccan effort has burned with what Regragui called “the determination to avoid losing.”

“For a country like ours,” he said, “the adrenaline and the pressure is so intensive. Of course you want to go down in the history books, but that takes up a lot of energy.”

Morocco fans filled the streets of Doha, Qatar, with cheers and flares after their World Cup victory over Spain on Dec. 6. (Video: Reuters)

Thereby did a country that hadn’t seen a World Cup knockout stage since 1986, when its beloved upstarts of yore played matches in the fervent futbol Mexican burgs of Guadalajara and Monterrey, slide past a Spain squad that had 76 percent of the possession and whose World Cup title in 2010 highlights its frequenting of said knockout stages.

“We realized we weren’t going to have a lot of possession,” Regragui said, and so, “We were humble enough to say, ‘We aren’t France, England or Germany, so we don’t have as much possession as them,’ ” and so, “If we were going to do it that way, we were going to have to be extremely well-organized.”

So they were in a neighborhood tussle played away from the neighborhood, between countries with 11½ miles of noncontiguous border, vying so that one side might brag while boating through the Strait of Gibraltar. Some 44,667 shoehorned in to watch — seemingly 44,666 Moroccans, judging by their songs all along and their jeers during long Spanish possessions, an atmosphere even Spain Manager Luis Enrique found “beautiful.”

Things went tensely and tautly, the goals all but walled. The Moroccan defenders often looked as if there were 15 of them. Enrique wound up gobsmacked by 22-year-old Moroccan Azzedine Ounahi, who plays in France: “This number eight doesn’t stop running; he must be [exhausted].” There came long stretches of Spanish possession around midfield that looked pretty but didn’t penetrate, the passing impressive but also at times seemingly unrelated to the idea of attacking the net over there. Morocco had some hopeful counterattacks.

Finally, Spain, which also went out in the round of 16 in 2018, closed down the whole fatigue factory in the 123rd minute when Pablo Sarabia, who had come on in the 118th for the purpose of taking penalties, got two mild chances in regular play. The first wound up cleared by Jawad El Yamiq and briefly looked as though it might end up an own goal, which would have epitomized fate’s capacity for cruelty. The second ached more as Sarabia fielded it low on the right, then sent a shot across with a tough angle that glanced barely off the post on the other side. Enrique wound up second-guessing himself for not giving more minutes to Sarabia, a 30-year-old who plays for French power Paris Saint-Germain.

Penalties came as they long seemed they would. Morocco started. Abdelhamid Sabiri, a substitute, shoved his to the right and in with no fuss as Simón slid the other way. Sarabia stepped up for Spain and smacked into the post.

Hakim Ziyech, a Netherlands-born, London-based star on this cosmo Moroccan team, knocked his straight ahead as Simón went left, making it 2-0 in the penalties. Carlos Soler, a Spanish substitute, saw Bono inch left, knocked his kick to the right and promptly saw Bono lurch back left to corral it. That took things to the edge of dire for Spain.

“I don’t know,” Bono said of penalties. “There’s a little bit of feeling and a little bit of luck. There’s not much you can really say about it. You know how penalties are. It’s just one of those things.”

On came Morocco’s Badr Benoun, who hit a weak one Simón collected in his gut, keeping things at 2-0. Then came 34-year-old Sergio Busquets, the last player left from Spain’s 2010 apex, when it won the World Cup and fielded one of the best national teams ever, a generation that has given way to a set of pups whose better chances surely lie ahead.

Busquets pulled his kick left as Bono dived squarely right — right smack into it. “If we had another penalty,” Enrique joshed, “I would substitute Bono, their goalkeeper.”

It still stood 2-0, with Morocco on the verge of something big and something else. Hakimi eased his shot ahead, a technique known as a Panenka, and then he turned and did a modest dance and smiled like mad and waited for his charging mates. “Today,” Regragui said, “I think it showed to the world that every Moroccan is Moroccan with his passport. When you come to the national team, you want to die. You want to fight.”

Three Spanish players would have the tiny consolation of company for their misery. Twenty-six Moroccan players would have celebrated lives up ahead. “As time goes on,” Bono said, “maybe we can realize what we have achieved” — and the noise indicated they would have so many voices to help with that.

There he was, a 37-year-old without a club after his Manchester United divorce and now on the outs with his national team, in a yellow bib warming up with the other reserves.

Before long, one of soccer’s all-time greats was an afterthought, reduced to springing off the bench to celebrate the goals of others — three times alone for his replacement, 21-year-old Gonçalo Ramos, who, until three weeks ago, had never played for the national team.

“Not even in my wildest dreams did I dream of being part of the starting 11 for the knockout phase of the World Cup and scoring a hat trick,” Ramos said.

No one had scored a hat trick in the knockout stage of the World Cup since Czechoslovakia’s Tomas Skuhravy against Costa Rica in 1990.

Ramos’s first goal was of Ronaldo quality, a quick turn and rasping drive into the top near corner in the 17th minute. Ronaldo joined the red-and-green mass at the corner flag, playfully slapping Ramos in the face.

Then it was Pepe, who debuted for Portugal when Ramos was 6, flexing his almost 40-year-old legs and soaring for an authoritative header of a corner kick in the 33rd minute. Ronaldo joined that party, too, hugging his longtime teammate.

Portugal was well on its way to the quarterfinals for the first time since 2006. It will face Morocco on Saturday. Will Portugal even need Ronaldo?

“Sometimes people are not very happy, but we have to deal with it,” Coach Fernando Santos said. “I’ve known him since he was 19, and this relationship has only developed. Ronaldo and I never misinterpret the human and personal aspect with that of manager and player.”

Asked whether Ronaldo would start against Morocco, Santos said he has 24 available players and all are able to play. Given how well Ramos performed — and how dominant Portugal was — it’s hard to imagine any changes.

“He is dynamic, attacks spaces and gives us strong pace,” Santos said of Ramos. He said Ronaldo remains in the mix, as does forward André Silva. “For every match, every opponent,” Santos added, “I will send in the one I believe fits our strategy best.”

In his first national team start, Ramos also scored in the 51st and 67th minutes to become the first player to record a hat trick in this tournament. Raphaël Guerreiro and substitute Rafael Leão also added second-half goals.

Ramos said Santos’s decision to leave Ronaldo out of the lineup was not a topic of discussion among the players before the match, adding that Ronaldo was supportive of his teammates.

“Cristiano, as our captain, did what he always does: He helped us and encouraged us,” Ramos said.

The Portuguese did not need much encouragement. From the start, this was clearly their night.

“We intend to have a team that plays with a lot of fluidity,” Santos said. “I would say we played very well today. It was a very, very good match in all aspects — a team that was circulating, had ball possession, had a lot of trust, had a lot of confidence.”

That was particularly true of Ramos, a Benfica attacker who, in the lead-up to the tournament, scored five goals in four matches, including his first international goal during a friendly against Nigeria. He made two brief appearances in the group stage before replacing one of his idols, Ronaldo.

“He’s got that striker’s smell, knowing where the ball is going to land to finish the action,” midfielder Bernardo Silva said.

Switzerland was seeking its first quarterfinal berth since 1954, when it hosted the World Cup. Until Manuel Akanji ended Portugal’s four-goal rush with a simple finish in the 58th minute, the Swiss had not scored in the knockout round since that 1954 quarterfinal against Austria.

Coach Murat Yakin cited illnesses to multiple players for a depleted roster. But he said: “We also have to admit our opponent was better, faster and [superior] in the attack. We just have to take it. Defeat is painful.”

The teams had split two UEFA Nations League matches in June, but any hope of Switzerland pulling off a World Cup upset was put to rest early. The Portuguese were humming from the start, and given the speed with which they were performing and the amount of space they were seizing, the Swiss were no match. Bruno Fernandes, Ronaldo’s former Manchester United teammate, and João Félix pierced Switzerland’s fragile resistance.

Ramos got the rout going with his splendid first goal from a tight angle. Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer didn’t react in time to stop the blazing shot.

Pepe’s towering finish of a corner kick was the ninth goal of his 132-game international career. Ramos almost had another before halftime, but Sommer, fully extended, used his fingertips to touch the ball wide.

But Portugal never looked back. In the 51st minute, Ramos made a near-post run and poked in Diogo Dalot’s cross.

The teams exchanged goals, then as the clock hit the 60-minute mark, a chant started: “Ronallll-do! Ronallll-do!” A dozen minutes later, Santos summoned Ronaldo — and the crowd erupted.

Ramos continued to steal the spotlight, chipping the ball over Sommer.

Ronaldo appeared to score on a partial breakaway in the 84th — only to have it disallowed because he had been well offside.

“Those issues [with Ronaldo] have been solved,” Santos said. “This is something that is finished. It’s very important to look at the example of his history. He’s one of the greatest players in the world — in terms of being a professional, as a captain, the number of goals he’s scored, how he came into the game with a lot of will. All we have to do is think about this team collectively.”

RAYYAN, Qatar — In the aftermath of Morocco’s sensational victory over Spain, the triumphant Moroccan squad posed for a picture with a flag. It wasn’t their own green star-on-crimson banner, nor the flag of Algeria, Tunisia or Lebanon, all of which flapped in the stands in a reflection of the Pan-Arab solidarity that has coursed through the first World Cup in the Middle East. Instead, the Moroccans waved the flag of Palestine, an explicit echo of support for a cause that has suffused the whole tournament. At the match on Tuesday evening, Palestinian emblems were everywhere, draped across people’s shoulders, on scarves, on T-shirts.

Outside the stadium beforehand, I met Mona Allaoui, a resident of Rabat, the Moroccan capital, who wore a Palestinian kaffiyeh over her Moroccan national team shirt. “I don’t care about politics,” she said, by which she meant the political normalization agreements, known as the Abraham Accords, signed between her nation’s leaders and Israel in 2020. “I support the Palestinians because I’m a human being and they are our brothers and sisters.”

At a tournament bombarded from all fronts by political concerns, the cause of Palestine is a kind of leitmotif. While authorities have from time to time blocked those sporting LGBTQ rainbows or anti-Iran regime iconography, the Palestinian flag has been ubiquitous at the World Cup’s stadiums, no matter which teams are playing. Banners calling for a “Free Palestine” were raised in the stands of at least one game, while a protester at a match involving Tunisia invaded the pitch waving a Palestinian flag. During games, fans from Arab nations have chanted for Palestinian rights and against recent killings of Palestinians by Israeli security forces. They did so again Tuesday.

Interactions between Israeli journalists — invited to Qatar for the World Cup despite the absence of formal relations between both countries — and various fans they came across in Doha, Qatar, underscored the prevalence of the issue. Videos that proliferated on social media showed bemused or startled Israeli reporters being berated by passersby. In one encounter with Moroccan fans who walk away shouting “Palestine,” Raz Shechnik of Israel’s Yediot Aharonot beseeched them: “But you signed peace!”

רז שכניק, עוז מועלם



תשמעו, לא רצינו לכתוב את הדברים האלה. תמיד חשבנו שלא אנחנו, העיתונאים, הם הסיפור. בטח לא במפעל הכי גדול של הספורט העולמי לצד האולימפיאדה. אבל אחרי עשרה ימים בדוחא, אי אפשר שלא לחלוק אתכם את מה שעובר עלינו כאן. לא מתכוונים לייפות. אנחנו מרגישים שנואים, עטופי> pic.twitter.com/nMTApXtBWb — Raz Shechnik (@RazShechnik) November 26, 2022

The Abraham Accords, forged by the Trump administration, paved the way for the normalization of ties between Israel and four Arab states — the three monarchies of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, as well as Sudan. It was hailed as a major regional breakthrough and a mark of a shifting political order in the Middle East, with certain Arab powers losing interest in the entrenched struggle over Palestinian dispossession and more animated by other priorities, from countering Iran to boosting their economies. This week, Israeli President Isaac Herzog called on the royals of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in what were billed as landmark visits.

The World Cup, though, has showed how small the vision of that supposed peace is. In recent months, there has been plenty of chatter in Washington about how Israeli officials and business executives have become a common sight in Abu Dhabi and Dubai and even in Riyadh (the Saudis have yet to normalize relations with Israel, though there’s a depth of connections). But what goes often unsaid in the U.S. and Israeli conversation about these normalization deals is the extent to which they only reflect top-level elite interests in the region.

Israelis in Qatar reckoned with that reality. “There are a lot of attempts by many people here, from all around the Arab world, to come out against us because we represent normalization,” Ohad Hemo, a reporter for Israel’s Channel 12, told his network. “Israelis’ wish came true, we signed peace agreements with four Arab states, but there are also the people, and many of them don’t like our presence here.”

Some Israeli commentators saw the backlash as evidence of enduring anti-Israeli, even antisemitic sentiment in the region. “This isn’t a knock on the Abraham Accords, or even on peace with Jordan and Egypt,” wrote Lahav Harkov of the Jerusalem Post. “They are all significant and all brought positive results for Israel and for those countries. But it’s also a wake-up call about the limitations of those agreements.”

Recent polling shows that overwhelming majorities of ordinary citizens in many Arab countries, including those that participated in the Abraham Accords, disapprove of formalizing ties with Israel. “There is clearly not much love in the Arab world for Israel,” wrote Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington-based risk consultancy that focuses on the region. “The decades of humiliation, resentment, and anger which many Arabs feel toward Israel cannot simply vanish with the signing of such normalization agreements.”

Still key for millions of people in the Arab world, their governments aside, is the political condition of Palestinians, millions of whom live lives circumscribed by Israel’s security interests, shorn of the same rights afforded to the Israelis around them. For years, most Arab governments conditioned normalization with Israel on the advent of a separate Palestinian state. But the process to create that state has effectively collapsed, while Israel’s new far-right government contains numerous politicians who oppose any scenarios in which Palestinian statehood could ever be viable.

“Ordinary Arabs are against this occupation and see it as inhuman and unacceptable,” said Mahjoob Zweiri, a professor of history and contemporary politics at Qatar University.

Zweiri said the political tenor of the tournament in Qatar has offered a clear message not just to the United States and Israel, but to Arab governments that also seem intent on obscuring the political priorities of Palestinians. The presence of Palestinian flags at stadiums was “not organized by states, but something genuine from within the people themselves,” he said. “The World Cup is about ordinary people, it’s about middle-class people. It’s not about the elite.”

“They can talk about normalization about 100 years, but they cannot impose it,” Zweiri said.

That’s a view recognized by some in Israel. “After the Abraham Accords were signed with several Arab countries in 2020, rightist pundits claimed that the Palestinians’ fate no longer interests other Arabs,” wrote Uzi Baram in left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz. “They didn’t bother to read the article in the agreement stating that their fulfillment requires establishing a Palestinian state. As for the symbiosis between the Palestinians and other Arab nations, no further proof seems needed following the World Cup in Qatar.”

Aladdin Awwad, 42, a Palestinian cybersecurity specialist who works in Doha, was at Morocco’s victory over Spain. His brother had draped a Palestinian flag over the Morocco jersey he was wearing.

“It’s great to see all these Arab nationalities support our cause and show the West that Palestine will not die,” Awwad told me. “We are not here to create problems. We are not against peace. But we exist and we are here.”

The round of 16 is over, and the World Cup now finally takes its first breather with the quarterfinal matchups set. Morocco — the last remaining team from Africa — is the biggest surprise after stunning 2010 champion Spain in penalty kicks, advancing to its first World Cup quarterfinal. Later Tuesday, Portugal delivered an offensive onslaught, overpowering Switzerland, 6-1 to set up a meeting with the underdog Moroccans.

On Monday, 2018 finalist Croatia rallied from a goal down to Japan before winning in a penalty kick shootout. Then five-time World Cup winner Brazil, the top-ranked team in the world, looked the part in an easy 4-1 win over South Korea.

Tuesday’s results

Morocco’s surprising run at the World Cup continued Tuesday, as the Atlas Lions advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time and eliminated Spain in a penalty-kick shootout (3-0) after the sides played to a scoreless draw. Spain failed to score on its first three attempts in the shootout, as Morocco became the first African team since Ghana in 2010 to reach the quarterfinals.

Gonçalo Ramos, a 21-year-old starting in place of Cristiano Ronaldo for Portugal, scored a hat trick in his international breakthrough as the Portuguese routed Switzerland, 6-1. Portugal has advanced to the semifinals twice, but not since 2006.

Morocco will face Portugal Saturday at 10 a.m.

Up next …

After 17 straight days of action, the World Cup finally takes a break. There are no games on Wednesday or Thursday, the first rest days since Qatar and Ecuador opened play on Nov. 20.

The quarterfinals begin on Friday with two matches: Croatia meets Brazil at 10 a.m., followed by Argentina and the Netherlands at 2 p.m. Croatia and the Netherlands have both been to a World Cup final — three times for the Netherlands, once for Croatia — but neither has won the championship. Brazil has won the World Cup five times, and Argentina has two titles.

The winners will meet next Tuesday at 2 p.m. Brazil and Argentina have met in the World Cup four times, but not since 1990.

Looking ahead at the rest of the World Cup

Here’s a look at the rest of the tournament schedule. All times Eastern.

What to know about the World Cup group stage

Group A: The Netherlands defeated Senegal, tied with Ecuador and then had no trouble with Qatar, finishing the group stage without a loss, conceding just a single goal. Senegal and Ecuador always seemed likely to compete for the second slot, and Senegal’s 2-1 win Tuesday was the deciding factor. Qatar, the host country, was the first team eliminated from the tournament.

Group C: In what once seemed like the wildest group, favorite Argentina was stunned by Saudi Arabia in its opening match before rallying to win the group with victories over Mexico and Poland. Despite that loss, Poland finished second on goal differential, advancing to the knockout round for the first time since 1986. Mexico had the same results as Poland but finished with a minus-one goal differential while Poland was level. Saudi Arabia’s only points came in its shocking upset over Argentina.

Group D: France got the two wins it needed for qualification in its first two games before falling, 1-0, to Tunisia in its third match. The defending champions still won the group with six points based on goal differential. Surprising Australia earned wins over Tunisia and Denmark to claim Group D’s second spot. Tunisia will heartily celebrate its closing win over France, while Denmark will stand as a huge disappointment, finishing with just one goal and one point.

Group E: Japan bracketed a loss to Costa Rica with shocking wins over Germany and Spain to finish atop the group. That left Spain and Germany tied in second with four points — both teams beat Costa Rica and they played to a draw — but Spain advanced based on its far superior goal differential. Costa Rica was eliminated, despite beating the group winner.

Group F: Belgium may have been the group favorite and one of the world’s top-ranked teams, but it was upstaged by upstart Morocco, which beat both the Belgians and Canada and drew with Croatia to win the group. Croatia was also unbeaten with two scoreless draws and a convincing win over Canada, which played an attractive brand of soccer but lost all three of its matches.

Group G: Brazil won the group despite scoring just three goals — oddly, the fewest in the group. Switzerland’s thrilling win over Serbia on Friday secured second place, while Cameroon and Serbia were both eliminated.

Group H: Portugal had already clinched a spot in the knockout round after wins over Ghana and Uruguay, which meant it had little to play for in the finale against South Korea. When South Korea scored a shocking late goal to beat Portugal, 2-1, that left Uruguay in third place on the goals scored tiebreaker. Ghana beat South Korea, but lost its other two matches to finish last in an entertaining group.

World Cup in Qatar The latest: Portugal cruised to an easy 6-1 win over Switzerland and will face Morocco in the quarterfinals on Saturday after the Atlas Lions stunned Spain in a penalty shootout earlier Tuesday. USMNT: The U.S. men’s national team fell to the Netherlands, 3-1, on Saturday in the opening match of the round of 16. The United States has not won a World Cup knockout match since 2002, when it beat regional rival Mexico in the round of 16 in South Korea.

378,"Justice Dept. subpoenas Ariz., Mich., Wis. officials in Trump Jan. 6 probe","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Special counsel Jack Smith has sent grand jury subpoenas to local officials in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin — three states that were central to President Donald Trump’s failed plan to stay in power following the 2020 election — seeking any and all communications with Trump, his campaign, and a long list of aides and allies.

The requests for records arrived in Dane County, Wis.; Maricopa County, Ariz.; and Wayne County, Mich., late last week, and in Milwaukee on Monday, officials said. They are among the first known subpoenas issued since Smith was named last month by Attorney General Merrick Garland to oversee Trump-related aspects of the investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, as well as the criminal probe of Trump’s possible mishandling of classified documents at his Florida home and private club.

The subpoenas, at least three of which are dated Nov. 22, indicate that the Justice Department is extending its examination of the circumstances leading up to the Capitol attack to include local election officials and their potential interactions with the former president and his representatives related to the 2020 election.

The virtually identical requests to Arizona and Wisconsin seek communications with Trump, in addition to employees, agents and attorneys for his campaign. Details of the Michigan subpoena, confirmed by Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, were not immediately available.

“I’m happy to participate in this process,” said George Christenson, the Milwaukee County clerk, who confirmed the subpoena in a telephone interview Tuesday and provided a copy to The Washington Post.

Christenson said he was not aware of any communications with his office or the Trump campaign that have not already been made public. But he speculated that federal investigators are hunting for new details about the campaign’s efforts to convene illegitimate, pro-Trump electors in key battleground states that Joe Biden narrowly won.

Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell, whose county encompasses Madison, Wis., the state capital, released a similar subpoena and said he, too, believed that all significant communications had already been made public.

Fields Moseley, a spokesman for Maricopa County, said, “We have received a subpoena and will comply.”

Officials in Wayne County, home of Detroit, confirmed the subpoena but declined to provide details.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.

The department’s long-running Jan. 6 investigation has moved beyond the large pool of people who directly took part in the bloody riot at the U.S. Capitol to focus on other aspects of the attempts to overturn the election results. Prosecutors are examining the fundraising, organizing and rhetoric that preceded the riot, and looking at failed efforts to authorize alternate slates of electors. They secured subpoenas this spring and summer for communications between Trump’s inner circle and scores of campaign officials, potential electors and others.

After Trump declared last month that he would again seek the White House in 2024, Garland appointed Smith, a longtime federal prosecutor who once headed the Justice Department’s public corruption section, to oversee the elements of the Jan. 6 investigation potentially related to the former president.

Smith also is overseeing the Mar-a-Lago criminal investigation, which began this spring, after months of disagreement between Trump and the National Archives and Records Administration over boxes of documents that followed the former president from the White House to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida residence and private club.

Court papers say more than 300 documents marked “classified” were eventually recovered from Trump’s home, more than 100 of them taken during an Aug. 8 FBI search of the property. Some contained extremely sensitive government secrets. The Justice Department is examining whether Trump may have mishandled those materials, destroyed government property or attempted to obstruct efforts to retrieve the materials.

Previous subpoenas, in Arizona and other battleground states targeted by Trump, have been issued to key Republican players seen as allies in his pressure campaign to reverse the results of the 2020 election. Maricopa County, the sprawling Arizona jurisdiction that is home to Phoenix and more than half the state’s voters, was among several localities on the receiving end of that pressure.

The Post could not confirm Tuesday whether the latest round of subpoenas went to local officials in any other states. The office of the secretary of state in Pennsylvania, another 2020 contested state, declined to comment. State and local election officials in another contested state, Georgia, said they knew of no subpoenas arriving in the past week. Officials in Clark County, Nev., the sixth contested state, declined to comment.

The Arizona subpoena was addressed to Maricopa County’s elections department, while the Wisconsin versions were addressed to the Milwaukee and Dane clerks. All seek communications from June 1, 2020, through Jan. 20, 2021.

The requested communications include those with Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, and other advisers, such as Boris Epshteyn. Attorneys identified include Trump campaign lawyers Justin Clark and Matthew Morgan, as well as those serving in other capacities, such as John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Cleta Mitchell.

Those three subpoenas, while sent out by Smith, were also signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Burke.

Trump and key allies tried to avert his narrow losses in the six battleground states through a lengthy pressure campaign. For instance, after losing Wisconsin by about 21,000 votes, Trump sought recounts in Milwaukee and Dane counties, the state’s most populous and most Democratic jurisdictions.

The recounts showed slightly worse results for Trump than the initial tally, but Trump used the process to ask the state Supreme Court to invalidate hundreds of thousands of votes — a proposal the justices rejected 4-3.

The subpoenas seek communications with James Troupis, a former Dane County judge who oversaw Trump’s legal efforts in Wisconsin. They also seek exchanges with attorney Kenneth Chesebro, who sent memos to Troupis in November and December 2020 about assembling slates of illegitimate electors.

On Jan. 6, 2021, Troupis asked Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) to help get false-elector paperwork to Vice President Mike Pence as Congress convened to confirm the election results. Johnson did not carry out the request after an aide to Pence said the paperwork should not be given to him.

Biden handily won Michigan’s Wayne County, but the county’s canvassing board initially deadlocked when it came to finalizing the results, with the board’s two Democrats voting to certify the results and its two Republicans refusing to do so. Hours later, the Republicans relented, and the board unanimously certified the results.

In Maricopa County, the pressure focused heavily on urging the GOP-controlled governing board to delay certifying the election results.

Then-Supervisor Steve Chucri, a Republican, has said he met with Giuliani at the state Capitol in mid-to-late November 2020. In December, Giuliani tried to reach Republican supervisors Bill Gates, Jack Sellers and Clint Hickman by phone. Days later, Trump himself twice tried to speak to Hickman, then chair of the governing board.

The calls came on Dec. 31, 2020, as Hickman was at dinner with his wife and friends, and again on Jan. 3, 2021, the same day The Post broke news of Trump’s conversation with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump had urged the Georgia election director to “find” enough votes to reverse his loss there.

Hickman, who had been told by Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward to expect outreach by Trump, let both calls go to voice mail. “Hello, sir. This is the White House operator, I was calling to let you know that the president’s available to take your call if you’re free,” one voice mail said. “If you could please give us a call back, sir, that’d be great. You have a good evening.”

After the county board certified the election results, Trump and his allies sought to discredit them — pushing what would become a months-long inspection of ballots and voting equipment ordered by the GOP-led state Senate.

Some of the figures named in the subpoena were either involved in, or encouraged, that haphazard 2021 review, which also ended up affirming Trump’s loss.

Marley reported from Madison, Wis., and Wingett Sanchez from Phoenix. Matthew Brown in Atlanta and Rosalind S. Helderman, Perry Stein and Emma Brown in Washington contributed to this report.

Congress is poised to force the Pentagon to end the military’s coronavirus vaccine mandate under compromise legislation to authorize funding for the Defense Department, a major capitulation for Democrats who championed the policy despite sharp controversy in the ranks over its implementation. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The abrupt termination of the requirement, which became Pentagon policy in August 2021, came after Republican lawmakers threatened to stymie action on the $858 billion bill. It was incorporated into the legislation in apparent defiance of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who “supports maintaining the vaccine mandate,” Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said this week, adding, “The health and readiness of our forces is critical to our warfighting capability and a top priority.”

Yet Republicans who championed the repeal were quick to label it a first step, calling on the Biden administration to reenlist service members discharged under the policy.

“Make no mistake: this is a win for our military,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in a statement late Tuesday night, warning that when the GOP takes over the House next year, Republicans will “work to finally hold the Biden administration accountable and assist the men and women in uniform who were unfairly targeted.”

While the decision to roll back the vaccine mandate was politically divisive, freezing negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate armed services committees for several days, it is far from the only Pentagon policy challenged in the compromise defense bill. The measure, which the full House and Senate still must vote to approve, pushes the Defense Department and related agencies to adopt several ventures, including new programs to arm Taiwan and scrutinize military assistance to Ukraine, and retain aging weapons systems the Biden administration has slated for decommissioning.

The bill creates several new accountability measures for the billions of dollars in military assistance being sent to Ukraine. Those include ordering reports from the Defense Department and a consortium of inspectors general about the methods being employed to track weapons, with the aim of identifying potential shortfalls.

While enhanced oversight of Ukraine aid has become a rallying cry for Republicans skeptical of the continued provision of advanced systems and munitions, the measures included in the defense bill had earlier secured bipartisan support in the House. The Senate never voted on its version of the bill before the compromise legislation’s unveiling.

The bill creates new pots of funding to underwrite training and weapons purchases for Taiwan, which faces increasing threats to its independence from China, and approves the island for presidential drawdown authority — a program that enables the United States to send weapons from its stocks to U.S. allies. The Biden administration has leaned on the tool heavily in its efforts to keep Ukraine armed in its fight against Russia.

The bill would dedicate $1 billion in presidential drawdown authority for Taiwan annually over five years, plus $2 billion per year in grant assistance for training and weapons purchases. Those sums would put Taiwan behind only Israel in terms of the military aid it receives on an annual basis.

The effort gained more momentum from lawmakers who, aghast at Russia’s assault on Ukraine, hoped to prevent a similar situation from manifesting between China and Taiwan. Tensions over Taiwan reached a fever pitch during negotiations this summer, after Beijing reacted to a visit by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) by canceling diplomatic engagements with the United States and launching missiles over the waters around Taiwan. Such tensions have calmed a bit in recent weeks, as President Biden and his top national security advisers have held direct talks with their Chinese counterparts on the sidelines of international confabs.

The Taiwan provisions, according to congressional aides, were crafted with White House input. But the defense bill resists other changes the administration has tried to make to the U.S. arsenal amid fresh challenges from China and other rival nations, particularly in the realm of nuclear weapons.

Earlier this year, the Pentagon announced it would retire two classes of nuclear arms it deemed superfluous: the megaton-plus capacity B83-1 gravity bomb and the tactical submarine-launched cruise missile known as the SLCM-N. The defense bill keeps a pot of $25 million on hand for continued research into the SLCM-N system, and “limits retirement” of the B83-1 “until a suitable replacement capability for defeating hard and deeply buried targets can be identified,” according to a summary of the legislation.

The House is expected to pass the measure Wednesday, setting up a vote in the Senate that would send the measure to Biden for final approval — and maintain a six-decade long tradition of Congress passing defense authorization bills, even when other parts of the federal government failed to receive such focused consideration.

But the new programs may not come online for some time. Lawmakers have yet to reach a deal to fund the government with a budget bill that would take all of the authorized measures into account. And as the deadline looms — the current federal budget expires Dec. 16 — Congress may have to pass a short-term spending measure to avert a government shutdown before the holidays, as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) predicted Tuesday.

380,"House panel fines Cawthorn over $15,000 for promoting cryptocurrency","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The House Ethics Committee has directed Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) to pay more than $15,000 in fines and fees for encouraging people to purchase a cryptocurrency in which he had a financial interest that was not properly disclosed. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight According to the committee’s 81-page report released Tuesday, Cawthorn has until the end of the month to pay $14,237.49 — “reflecting the approximate value of the gift he received” — to “an appropriate charitable organization,” and an additional $1,000 in late filing fees to the Treasury Department within 14 days of the report’s release.

The congressman lost his primary in May and his term ends next month.

The House panel’s investigative subcommittee (ISC) “found substantial evidence that Representative Cawthorn promoted a cryptocurrency in which he had a financial interest in violation of rules protecting against conflicts of interest, and that he failed to file timely reports to the House disclosing his transactions relating to the cryptocurrency,” the report said.

Advertisement

The subcommittee “did not find that Representative Cawthorn knowingly or willfully failed to file timely disclosures; nonetheless, the ISC found that he is required by statute to pay the applicable late filing fees for his untimely disclosures.”

The committee investigated but did not find sufficient evidence of insider trading, efforts to artificially inflate the value of the coin or an intent to personally enrich himself.

The report also found no evidence to support allegations this year that Cawthorn had an improper relationship with a staffer.

Cawthorn’s office had no immediate response to the report.

According to the report, Cawthorn paid $150,000 for 180 billion “Let’s go, Brandon,” or LGB Coin, on Dec. 21, 2021. By that time, Republicans had adopted the phrase as a vulgar expression against President Biden. On the morning of Dec. 22, images could be found on social media of Cawthorn touting the coin.

Advertisement

On Dec. 30, 2021, LGB Coin announced that it would sponsor a NASCAR driver, Brandon Brown, in the 2022 racing season. The following day, Cawthorn sold a bunch of the LGB Coin he had just purchased.

Then, on Jan. 4, 2022, NASCAR announced that it was withdrawing its approval for LGB Coin to sponsor a driver in its competitions, leading the price of the coin to plummet. That same day, Cawthorn sold more of his LGB Coin and, nearly two weeks later, sold nearly all the remaining LGB Coin he owned, according to the report.

Cawthorn, according to the report, “was seen in multiple photographs and videos in which he appeared to support or specifically encouraged individuals to purchase LGB Coin, including after the value of the LGB Coin that he held plummeted.” But officials did not come to a consensus about whether Cawthorn “intended to personally profit from his promotional activities.”

Advertisement

As of mid-November, Cawthorn told officials that he owned nearly 15,400,000,000 LGB Coin that he “believed” was valued at “$357.52,” though, the report notes, “it is unclear how Rep. Cawthorn reached his estimation of the value.”

In the report, officials said Cawthorn’s behavior in connection to the coin “did not reflect creditably upon the House.”

The report is a capstone to the brief tenure of the one-term Republican whose status as a rising star in the party was quickly eclipsed by bizarre scandals and allegations of wrongdoing.

Cawthorn was elected to Congress in November 2020 at age 25 and was a fierce defender of President Donald Trump. In his time in office, he was pulled over for speeding and was charged with driving with a revoked license. He tried bringing a loaded gun onto an airplane.

He accused fellow Republicans of hosting orgies and doing cocaine. He also called President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine a “thug.” He amassed more than 1 million followers on social media but also drew a crowded field of Republican and Democratic opponents when he ran for reelection.

Cawthorn came in second place in the Republican primary in May, behind Chuck Edwards, a state senator, who went on to win the congressional seat in the general election.

381,"Congress drops media bargaining bill amid Facebook, industry blowback","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Lawmakers on Tuesday ended what had been an effort to allow media organizations to band together to negotiate revenue sharing deals with tech giants, leaving the provisions out of a massive spending bill amid intense pushback from industry and advocacy groups. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight The measure, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA), was omitted from a bicameral agreement on Congress’s sprawling defense-spending legislation, according to the bill’s text released late Tuesday. The JCPA provisions had been considered for potential inclusion, according to two people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.

The move came a day after Facebook said it would “consider removing news from our platform” if lawmakers moved ahead with the measure, a threat that publisher groups denounced.

Advertisement

The proposal would have created a temporary carve-out in antitrust law allowing news publishers and broadcasters to collectively push for more favorable distribution terms for their content online.

The effort, led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), had been billed by its proponents as a temporary lifeline for reeling news publications whose advertising revenue has plummeted over the past decade amid rapid growth of digital ad titans Google and Facebook.

“Continually allowing the big tech companies to dominate policy decisions in Washington is no longer a viable option when it comes to news compensation, consumer and privacy rights, or the online marketplace.” Klobuchar said in a statement Wednesday after the defense bill was released. “We must get this done.”

Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook parent Meta, blasted the bill Monday as “ill-conceived” and said the company would rather scrub news from its products than “submit to government mandated-negotiations that unfairly disregard any value we provide to news outlets.” The remarks echoed warnings the giant issued against similar regulations globally, including a high-profile bout in Australia.

NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association, two trade groups that count Google, Meta and Amazon as members, on Monday announced that they were taking out six-figure ad buys online and in broadcast to oppose the legislation amid reports that it was under discussion. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

A slew of consumer advocacy groups and think tanks had also lined up against the measure, arguing in a letter Monday that it could force tech platforms to carry extreme or harmful content and that it would disproportionately benefit large media conglomerates.

Klobuchar disputed those criticisms in an interview this year, saying smaller publishers would get a seat at the table in the discussions.

“I know the small newspapers in my state are huge fans of this bill,” she told The Washington Post. “I think that what this does is allow for the potential that content is going to be paid for appropriately and that journalists’ work will be compensated for instead of stolen.”

Advertisement

The bill had been endorsed by numerous media organizations, including trade groups like the News Media Alliance, newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, broadcast giants including the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp. and conservative digital outlets like the Daily Caller.

The Post is a member of the News Media Alliance (NMA). Shani George, a spokesperson for The Post, previously said in an email that The Post is “aware of [NMA’s] efforts around this legislation and we have not taken a public stance.”

The bill split progressives and conservatives alike, forming unlikely alliances on both sides of a years-long political fight over the future of news online. Critics on the left say it could force tech companies to take a more hands-off approach to content moderation, and critics on the right say it could enable major news outlets to “collude” with the tech giants to silence conservatives.

Advertisement

Meta’s threat followed a familiar playbook for the giant, which last year blocked news in Australia in response to similar legislation aimed at forcing tech companies to pay publishers for content. The company issued the same warning last month in response to parallel efforts in Canada.

The U.S. push came as broader efforts to rein in the tech giants over allegations of anti-competitive conduct have stalled in Congress, with time ticking away in its legislative session.

Hi, Carolyn: I am the mother of three who are in their 20s. They all use foul language regularly. I have been known to drop an f-bomb or two when I stub a toe and such. For them, it is just an adverb or verb they use calmly and constantly. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight I used to use foul language more often, until I worked with a guy who told me how offended he was by such words. As a result, I have cut back dramatically and use “gosh” or “heck” in online posts and in conversation. I feel that it makes my kids seem crass, or dull and unimaginative, while also being offensive to some. I shudder to think how my late parents would react if they were to hear it.

I have asked them to clean it up once or twice. One of them told me I was just too sensitive and behind the times because “people just don’t get offended” by this anymore.

Anything I can do? Am I overly sensitive, or well-mannered?

— Mother of Three

Mother of Three: Did your epiphany come after your kids were mostly grown, or early enough in their formative arcs that your kitchen was a modern-day hecking Mayberry?

I may have no reason to ask besides morbid curiosity … because either way, they’re launched. This isn’t a what-is-a-mother-to-do question anymore, not with your kids in their 20s.

Instead, it’s about where your authority ends and theirs (or anyone else’s) begins when it comes to decorum. Do you have standing to ask your kids to curb their profanity in your presence? Yes, you do, as anyone does. Do they have the right to ignore your requests? Yes, technically they do, though that’s rude and I hope they don’t exercise it. Do you have to stand for that? No, you don’t. But they’re your kids, so you may understandably have other priorities in your relationships with them.

I do see the emotional allure of parental loose-end-tying and i-dotting and touch-up spackling — you want to make sure they have the best possible chances in life. And/or, you don’t want to feel bad now that you somehow screwed them up. But:

1. Your “finishing” them is not necessary or even ideal. Could your parent have gotten through to grown-up you as effectively as your co-worker eventually did? Be honest with yourself.

2. It’s not possible. No one parent can teach all there is to teach.

3. Again, it’s too late.

Now’s the time to trust that you did your best and hope you got the general idea across of respecting self and others. And cross your fingers that code-switching fits into their concept of “the times.” And continue to teach by example. And make a mental offering to the gods in advance for watching over your kids as they grind their way to the logical mountaintop and see that you and “people” are not two separate things, and therefore some of the “people” they run across, and possibly count on for things — it just takes one — will find their profanity as crass, dull, unimaginative and sometimes-offensive as you do.

But out loud, for you, there’s only this: To gently persist with, “Language, please, so I can hecking eat my goshdarn dinner in peace.” Think of it as a kind of parent/grown child detente: You stop trying to raise them, and they — eventually, let’s hope — thank you with a little hecking ancestral respect.

Hi Jules: I’m a fairly well-known writer in a super niche corner of Twitter, but I’m having a problem with a friend who is completely unconnected to my niche. If one of her tweets comes up in conversation, she expresses great offense to the fact that I see her tweets but don’t engage with them. This happens often — to the point of her posting a whole tweet thread about how “real friends” support each other through likes and a bunch of other things that were clearly about me. But I honestly don’t like 99.9 percent of the things I see on social media.

I confronted her, and it resulted in a thousand-word text about her anxiety and how she thought I didn’t like her. Why would I hang out with someone I didn’t like? Why would I assist with the real life problems of someone I didn’t like? Also, she never likes my tweets (nor do I expect her to — my friends aren’t my publicists), so that detail makes this whole thing extra funny.

We currently aren’t speaking, and she also soft blocked me. I just feel so silly that this happened! While we’ll probably never hang out one-on-one again, we’ll very likely see each other in larger group settings. How should I handle this when this inevitable, in-person interaction occurs?

Follow Jules Terpak Follow

TwitterLikesGate: By saying you’ll probably never hang out one-on-one again, I assume you don’t want to revive your friendship. If that’s the case, when you cross paths, act as if the online relationship between you two doesn’t exist. Another conversation about the debacle would probably just cause a repeat of your text conversation.

Keep it simple: “Hey — I hope you’re doing well. What have you been up to?” Show that there’s still respect on your end, but remain firm in the belief that this bizarre social media situation is not worth the time or energy of either of you.

I’ve been in similar situations after unfollowing those I no longer talk to regularly. People typically see an unfollow as a sign of animosity, but I’ve always considered it to be more nuanced. Just as with life offline, it should be normal for people you connect with online to come and go. There’s an assumption that certain online interactions can make for uncomfortable in-person interactions — but that’s only if you act like things are uncomfortable. As long as I’ve maintained a “whatever” attitude, the other person reciprocated the same energy. If you do this and your friend reacts with hostility, wish her the best and be on your merry way. Like you said, this is so silly.

I could maybe sympathize with her outlook if we were talking about Instagram in 2015, when it was common to like every post shared by your friends because that’s all your feed was. But it’s 2022, and we’re now confronted with an unfathomable amount of content from a wide range of people every day. That extra step of engagement should never be expected of anyone. If you’ve already communicated your stance to her the same way you did in this letter, there’s no more hand-holding to be done. She’s actively choosing to ignore the realities of today’s digital culture, and at this point, only time and willingness can change her outlook.

If you decide you’d actually like to revive your friendship, it’s possible, but would require you to be on the same page. I maintain relationships with some family and friends where we don’t follow each other on social media, but are still comfortable talking about our lives online. If you decide that separating the online and offline aspects of your relationship is best, it may go over better than you expect.

Online social dynamics are tough to navigate, but for what it’s worth, I’m happy to validate that the “my friends are not my publicists” outlook is a great one. Digital culture is increasingly overwhelming, and it’s unreasonable to expect people to engage with everything you post.

Dear Miss Manners: My husband and I both work, and we have school-aged children involved in various activities. There are times when we go several days seeing each other only in bits and pieces of time. It is hectic, but we love it! Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight We also have a lot of extended family who live in other states. It is very hard to find a time when we can visit them, which is unfortunate. When they come here, they always want visits to last for several days to make it worth the trip. We only stay a night or two when we visit them.

I don’t know how to politely decline offers to visit us. If we tell them a time is not good because of other obligations, they will say things like, “You don’t have to entertain us!” or “I won’t be in the way, I promise!”

We have tried letting it happen, but there are always requests for us to change our schedule because they had traveled so far. Sometimes we do, and then the kids get annoyed that they are missing their activities. During things we can’t skip, we end up having people just sitting in our house without us, watching HGTV for hours while we’re at school or work.

Is there a polite way to say, “Actually, you ARE in the way?”

The drama of your phrasing notwithstanding, Miss Manners infers that you are seeking a solution for the larger dilemma, not a way to further insult your guests: Metaphorically speaking, you would prefer to avoid the fiery crash altogether, rather than learn what to do after the collision.

Sensible people, like defensive drivers, avoid predictable hazards. Your relatives promised not to be any trouble, only to later swerve into expecting you to play host. You did not believe them when they said it, but it does not excuse your being an absent host.

You did not have to invite them to stay, but, once you did, etiquette required that you clear some time for them. More generally, if you never slow down, you cannot really expect to take in any of the sights — meaning, have an actual relationship with your relatives.

Dear Miss Manners: I get numerous calls on my personal cellphone, and often am not available to answer. If someone in my contact list calls me and I do not answer, should I call them back, even if they do not leave me a message asking me to do so?

Not knowing who called or how you feel about speaking with them, Miss Manners cannot say if you should call them back, only that etiquette does not require that you do so.

She is aware of the argument that this is inefficient. But she suspects that those making it are more concerned with the few seconds they will spend explaining themselves to your voice mail than with the time the recipient will lose deciding whether the call was pressing or of the I-was-in-the-car-and-had-time-to-kill variety.

Through therapy my fiance and I have learned to navigate their emotional immaturity and have grown immensely as a couple as a result. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight I am now wondering about wedding planning. What are the expectations around including in-laws who do not act as though they want to be included? Immediately after getting engaged my family began expressing excited enthusiasm for our plans. His mother could not even crack a smile on the day of the engagement.

His family has not mentioned the engagement a single time since it happened (and we see them every week).

It seems incredibly awkward and presumptuous to say to his parents, “Would you like to be included financially in the wedding planning?” or even, “We have started to plan, would you like to be involved?” when his family did not even congratulate us on the engagement.

Including them means conflict … but so does excluding them. What should we do?

— Mixed Emotions

Mixed: You seem averse to awkwardness, and yet — so much of wedding planning is awkward.

Understand that whenever you accept someone's money (or advice), there is a likelihood that they will interpret this as you basically “partnering” with them. Decide if you really want to ask for or accept money from people who have extreme boundary issues, and are also completely disinterested.

Is his family interested in hosting a rehearsal dinner (a traditional role taken on by the groom's family)? You could ask them if they're interested in taking that on and hosting it.

Otherwise, invite them as guests, save seats for them in the front of the venue, include them in photographs, and respect the boundaries you've established with as neutral an attitude as you can manage.

Remember that you and your guy are a team, and stick with your therapy — it will help you through this highly charged time.

Dear Amy: With the holidays coming up, it is time for something I detest — GROUP HOLIDAY TEXTS!

I'd like to announce that if you are really serious about wishing ME a Happy/Merry/Whatever, please take just a few seconds to send something personal to me instead of grouping me together with everyone in your contacts list.

You get that initial text, then your phone continues to go off all day long with people you don't even know replying “You too,” “Happy holidays to you and your family,” “We need to get together soon!”

One day I got 46 responses from people and I have no idea who they are.

Am I the only one who feels this way? My wife thinks I’m being a Scrooge.

Scrooge: I’m now wondering if Charles Dickens’s original inspiration for the Scrooge character came from receiving 46 texts on Christmas Eve from people he didn’t know.

I admit that I did not know until now that Merry Christmas group texts are a “thing.” And now that I do know they're a thing, I pray to baby Jesus that I don't land on anyone's list.

You should do a quick internet search to see how to remove yourself from these chains, or “mute” the conversation.

Dear Amy: I’m responding to “Stuck,” the woman who wanted to take a trip to the Scottish Highlands with her sister, but her husband wouldn’t let her.

My wife and I have been together for 56 years. She has three sisters and had three first cousins. All were raised together. My wife has spent her past three birthdays and wedding anniversaries in memory care with dementia.

But for a number of summers, she and some of the sisters and cousins went on “girls’ trips.” The pictures I have show my wife in all of her summer beauty in Michigan, North Carolina and other locales. My wife had our vehicle, a charge card for gas, lodgings and meals, as well as my blessings and cooperation.

She was happy, and so was I.

Life can seem very short. Many opportunities come but once — and then disappear. Illness has no calendar for good times.

“Stuck” should get unstuck, tell her husband to take a hike, and see what life has in store for her. I wish the girl I first saw at 18 were here for more “girls’ trips” — and me!

— Mark in Missouri

Mark: I have a feeling that when you close your eyes, you still see your wife “in all of her summer beauty.” Thank you for this.

386,Why you don’t need to drink 8 cups of water a day,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

We’ve all heard the age-old advice to drink eight cups of water a day. But if you fall short, don’t worry: That advice is probably wrong anyway. That’s according to new research, published in the journal Science, which found that for most healthy adults, drinking eight cups of water a day is completely unnecessary. The advice is misguided in part because it doesn’t take into account all the water that we get from our food and from other beverages like coffee and tea. The research found that our water needs vary from one person to next and depend on factors like your age, sex, size, physical activity levels and the climate that you live in.

The authors of the study say that for healthy adults, there is no real benefit to drinking eight cups of water a day. Nor is it dangerous: Your body will just excrete the extra water you consume in your urine.

Advertisement

“If you drink eight cups of water a day, you’ll be fine — you’re just going to be spending a lot more time in the bathroom,” said Herman Pontzer, a professor of evolutionary anthropology and global health at Duke University and a co-author of the study.

The advice to drink eight cups of water a day stems from a 1945 recommendation from the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council, which encouraged adults to consume about 64 ounces of water daily. The recommendation referred to a person’s total daily intake of water, including from all their foods and beverages, but it was widely misinterpreted to mean that people should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day.

Some experts have argued that the widely held belief was not rooted in science. One study of 883 elderly adults for example found that there was no evidence of dehydration among the 227 people in the study who routinely drank less than six glasses of water daily.

Advertisement

“Until we have more evidence-based documentation that fluid intake of eight glasses per day improves some aspect of an elderly person’s health,” the researchers concluded, “encouraging a fluid intake above a level that is comfortable for the individual seems to serve little useful purpose.”

Nevertheless, the advice is so widely ingrained that many companies use it to market products. You can buy 64-ounce water bottles designed to motivate you to drink the equivalent of eight cups of water daily, and water-bottle sensors that will track your water intake and remind you to “hydrate” every 30 to 40 minutes.

“We have guidelines telling people how much water to drink,” said Pontzer, who wrote a book on metabolism called “Burn.” “But the reality is that people have been kind of making it up.”

How much water do we really need?

To see how much water people really need, Pontzer and his co-authors analyzed data on 5,600 people in 26 countries who ranged in age from 8 days old to 96 years old. The participants included people from all walks of life, like farmworkers, athletes and non-athletes, sedentary office workers in Europe and the United States, and people from farming and hunter-gatherer societies in South American and Africa.

The participants were tracked with a gold-standard technique called “doubly labeled water,” which uses water laced with tracers that can be used to track the body’s production of carbon dioxide, allowing the researchers to get precise measurements of the participants’ daily energy expenditure. It also allowed them to estimate the amount of water the participants generated from metabolism and the water that they consumed.

“It’s really accurate at measuring how many calories you burn each day but also how much water you take in and how much goes out,” Pontzer said.

Using this method, the researchers determined how much water the participants lost and replaced each day, a measurement known as water turnover. They found that a person’s daily water turnover was largely determined by their size and their level of body fat, which contains less water than muscle and other organs.

Advertisement

The more “fat-free” mass a person has, the more water they need. Since men tend to have larger bodies and less body fat compared to women, they generally use more water. “Men use more water every day because we have a bigger system to keep hydrated,” Pontzer said.

The research showed that how much water you need changes over your lifetime. In general, our water needs peak between the ages of 20 and 50 and then decline in parallel with the slowing down of our metabolisms. That’s because the amount of water you need is partly dependent on your metabolism and how many calories you burn.

“All of the work that your cells do every day is water-based,” Pontzer said. “The ratio of the amount of water that you use to the number of calories that you burn stays fairly consistent over your life span.”

Climate and lifestyle influence your body’s water needs

Two other important factors that determine your water needs: Your climate and whether you lead a sedentary lifestyle. People who live in hotter climates and engage in more physical activity have higher levels of water turnover.

Advertisement

The study found that people from less developed regions of the world have higher levels of water turnover than people from developed countries. “We think that’s because if you’re in a poorer country, you’re likely to be working outside every day, and you have less access to climate control,” Pontzer said. “People in poorer countries are also often doing jobs that require more physical activity.”

He noted that as the world gets hotter, it is going to cause our water needs to increase, which will worsen problems for the 2 billion people across the globe who currently have limited or inadequate access to clean water.

Asher Y. Rosinger, an expert who was not involved in the study, said the research was “incredibly impressive” and the findings “make a lot of sense.” He said that for the most part, people tend to consume the amount of water that their bodies need.

But he cautioned that water turnover is not necessarily a precise measure of how hydrated a person is.

“In those hot environments, people are using more water, but we don’t necessarily know whether it’s sufficient to meet their water needs,” said Rosinger, the director of the Water, Health and Nutrition Lab at Penn State.

So how much water should you drink? The answer is simple: Drink when you’re thirsty. Prioritize water, and try to avoid sugary drinks, which can cause metabolic problems. Coffee and tea are fine as well.

While the caffeine they contain can increase urination, they will still be hydrating so long as you consume less than 400 milligrams of caffeine, Rosinger said. Keep in mind that you get water from your food as well. Some water-rich foods are fruits, vegetables, beans, yogurt, brown rice, and soups.

“If you’re paying attention to your body and drinking when you feel like you need to, then you should be fine,” Pontzer said.

387,TikTok ‘Liver King’ touted raw organ meat diet. He also took steroids.,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The self-proclaimed Liver King, a muscular and often shirtless TikTok star named Brian Johnson, amassed millions of followers by promoting an “ancestral” diet of beef brains, bull testicles and raw animal livers. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But recently, Johnson posted a different kind of viral video — an apology. Johnson admitted to taking anabolic steroids, something which he had repeatedly denied in the past. The confessional video has been viewed more than 2.6 million times on YouTube.

Bearded, with bulging abs and biceps, Johnson has been one of the breakout stars of social media this past year, rapidly building his following by claiming that one of the keys to strength, happiness and optimal health is a meat-heavy diet that prioritizes organ meats.

“I lied, and I misled a lot of people,” Johnson said to the camera. “Yes, I’ve done steroids and, yes, I’m on steroids.”

The admission of steroid use came after another fitness influencer posted a YouTube video exposing what he said were private emails in which Johnson described his steroid regimen. It included a litany of drugs and hormones, including regular injections of powerful anabolic steroids such as Winstrol, Deca-Durabolin and testosterone cypionate, as well as Omnitrope, a form of human growth hormone. Johnson did not respond to a request for an interview.

But to some of his critics, his admission of steroid use did not come as a surprise. “NO WAY you looked at the Liver King and thought he was all natural,” ESPN analyst and former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III wrote on Twitter.

Johnson, who is 44 according to voter registration records, is the owner of Ancestral Supplements, which sells capsules of concentrated beef liver, organs, bone and other dietary supplements. In an interview with GQ this year he claimed that his business ventures have brought in more than $100 million a year.

Johnson first started posting as the Liver King on Instagram and TikTok in August of 2021, and has since enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity with more than 1.7 million and 3.6 million followers, respectively. He was a frequent guest of popular podcasts hosted by internet celebrities like Logan Paul, where he steadfastly denied allegations of steroid use.

He urged his followers to lead a lifestyle supposedly modeled after that of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. He promoted nine “ancestral tenets” such as daily exercise, sun and cold exposure, proper sleep, social connection, and a controversial meat-heavy diet consisting largely of organ and muscle meats, “organic pastured egg yolks,” bone broth, raw full-fat milk and cheese, fermented vegetables and “wild caught fish eggs.”

“Ancient Primals evolved eating the whole animal, nose to tail, horns to hooves,” he said on his website.

The real eating habits of early humans

Meat-heavy diets have gained in popularity in recent years thanks to Johnson and a number of other fitness influencers. But experts say the characterization of an “ancestral” diet as consisting largely or solely of meat is misleading and inaccurate.

Archaeological evidence shows that humans evolved to eat a wide variety of foods, including many high-carbohydrate foods like fruits, vegetables, starchy plants and honey. And while modern hunter-gatherer societies that exist today include animals in their diets, they also tend to consume a lot of fiber and carbs, with some rare exceptions, said Herman Pontzer, a professor of evolutionary anthropology and global health at Duke University.

One such group that Pontzer and other anthropologists have studied extensively is the Hadza, a community in northern Tanzania who have hunted and foraged for tens of thousands of years.

The Hadza have low rates of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. They consume what some experts call the world’s oldest diet, which consists largely of small animals, fibrous plants like tubers and berries, and large quantities of honey collected from local beehives.

Another group that anthropologists have studied in depth is the Tsimane, a community of farmers, hunters and gatherers in Bolivia. The Tsimane are known among other things for their impressive cardiovascular health: They eat a carb and fiber-rich diet that contains things like corn, rice, cassava, bananas and fish and wild game.

“There’s a lot of cherry-picking of the evidence that’s out there to suggest that all hunter-gatherer diets or past ancestral diets were carnivore-like, with a lot of meat and hardly any fruits and vegetables, and there’s just absolutely no evidence for that at all,” said Pontzer, who has lived with the Hadza and published studies examining hunter-gatherer diets. “The reality is that people ate and still do eat a wide variety of diets.”

Pontzer noted that some cultures around the world have historically eaten a meat-heavy diet, like the Inuit, who live in northern Canada, Greenland and Alaska, where it’s too cold for many plants to grow. Another group, the Masaai, a pastoralist community that raises livestock in Kenya and Tanzania, are known to eat a lot of meat and drink the blood of the animals that they butcher. But Pontzer said humans have been farming for a lot longer than they have been raising livestock.

“Farming is about 10,000 to 12,000 years old, and pastoralism is less than 10,000 years old,” he said. “Farming plants started long before people started farming animals.”

Pontzer criticized Johnson’s misportrayal of ancestral diets, and said that he was not surprised by his admission of anabolic steroid use, in part because his extreme bodybuilding physique “is not something you ever see when you work with hunter gatherers or farming communities.”

“The guy is being called out for being a fraud — and that’s a feel-good story if I’ve ever heard one,” he said. “It’s easy to draw parallels between the fraudulent way he conducted himself and the fraudulent way people talk about ancestral diets.”

All-meat diets can cause digestive tract issues

On TikTok, and elsewhere, fitness influencers and online celebrities have been touting near or all-meat “carnivore” diets for years. But, Nancy Oliveira, the manager of the nutrition and wellness service at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said there’s “almost no published research” supporting a carnivore diet.

A carnivore diet cuts out all sources of fiber, which can lead to constipation and detrimentally affect a person’s gut microbiome, the communities of trillions of microbes that live in our digestive tracts and influence our health, Oliveira said.

Many people are trying to cut out processed foods from their diets, which can certainly improve your health, studies show. Red meats, like animal organs, are great sources of iron and can be very nutritious.

But, Oliveira said, the body benefits from a range of different fruits, vegetables and fibers. She said that if someone came to her and expressed interest in eating nothing but meat, she would suggest instead that they try the Paleo diet, which includes fish, eggs and meat but also allows fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and other plants.

“I think Paleo is much healthier,” Oliveria said. “I don’t know why our country is so extreme, where they have to do all or nothing.”

The risks of steroid use

According to the private emails allegedly sent by Johnson, he was at one point spending at least $11,000 a month on vials of the human growth hormone Omnitrope. In his apology, Johnson said he is still using steroids. Long-term steroid use can lead to an enlarged heart, kidney failure, liver damage and an increased risk of stroke or heart attack, as well as extreme mood swings, irritability and impaired judgment, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Johnson also acknowledged that Liver King was a public persona engineered to go viral “as an experiment” to spread his message of “ancestral living.”

Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator at McGill University’s Office for Science and Society who regularly investigates health information online, said that “even if the Liver King falls from grace” he will be replaced by yet another influencer. He’s one in a long line of influencers attempting to sell the secret to dieting and weight loss.

“Instagram and TikTok and all these other social media platforms are going to keep on churning out wellness influencers,” Jarry said. “They’re selling simple solutions to complex problems.”

388,What are ultra-processed foods? What should I eat instead?,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Is your diet ultra-processed? In many households, ultra-processed foods are mainstays at the kitchen table. They include products that you may not even think of as junk food such as breakfast cereals, muffins, snack bars and sweetened yogurts. Soft drinks and energy drinks count, too. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight These foods represent an increasingly large share of the world’s diet. Almost 60 percent of the calories that adults in America eat are from ultra-processed foods. They account for 25 to 50 percent of the calories consumed in many other countries, including England, Canada, France, Lebanon, Japan and Brazil.

Every year, food companies introduce thousands of new ultra-processed foods with an endless variety of flavors and ingredients. These products deliver potent combinations of fat, sugar, sodium and artificial flavors. They are what scientists call hyper-palatable: Irresistible, easy to overeat, and capable of hijacking the brain’s reward system and provoking powerful cravings.

Advertisement

Yet in dozens of large studies, scientists have found that ultra-processed foods are linked to higher rates of obesity, heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and colon cancer. A recent study of more than 22,000 people found that people who ate a lot of ultra-processed foods had a 19 percent higher likelihood of early death and a 32 percent higher risk of dying from heart disease compared with people who ate few ultra-processed foods.

So how do we break our dependence on ultra-processed foods? You can start by learning which foods in your diet count as ultra-processed. You don’t necessarily have to give them up. But once you know how to spot an ultra-processed food, it’s easy to find a less-processed substitute.

This is your body on ultra-processed foods

The growing focus on ultra-processed foods represents a paradigm shift in how the scientific and public health community is thinking about nutrition. Instead of focusing on the nutrients, calories or types of food, the emphasis instead is on what happens to the food after it’s grown or raised and the physical, biological and chemical processes that occur before we eat it.

Foods can be unprocessed or minimally processed — like the whole fruits and vegetables, chilled or frozen meats, dairy products and eggs that we buy. Other foods go through a moderate amount of processing — you can usually spot these foods because they have only a few ingredients on the label. Think freshly made breads and cheeses, salted peanut butter, pasta sauce, bags of popcorn and canned fruits, fish and vegetables.

Then there are ultra-processed foods. At their core, they are industrial concoctions containing a multitude of additives: salt, sugar and oils combined with artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, stabilizers and preservatives. Typically they’re subjected to multiple processing methods that transform their taste, texture and appearance into something not found in nature. Think Frosted Flakes, Hot Pockets, doughnuts, hot dogs, cheese crackers and boxed macaroni & cheese.

Research shows that our bodies seem to react differently to ultra-processed foods compared with similar foods that are not so highly processed.

In a rigorously controlled clinical trial that was carried out by the National Institutes of Health, scientists compared what happened when they fed a group of people a diet of ultra-processed foods for two weeks and, on a separate occasion, a diet of matching meals that were mostly made from scratch.

Both diets contained similar amounts of fat, sugar, sodium and fiber, and everyone was allowed to eat until they were satisfied. But to the researchers’ surprise, people ate substantially more calories when they were fed the ultra-processed foods. On average they ate about 500 more calories a day — roughly the amount in a large order of McDonald’s fries.

On the diet of ultra-processed foods, the participants quickly gained weight and body fat. But on the unprocessed, homemade diet, the reverse happened: They lost weight, and they had reductions in cholesterol and an increase in their levels of an appetite-suppressing hormone called PYY. They experienced a drop in their levels of ghrelin, what is known as the hunger hormone. It’s not clear why the unprocessed and ultra-processed foods had such differing effects.

Advertisement

“We can’t explain it yet,” said Kevin Hall, the lead author of the study and a scientist at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. “We have a dozen theories or more about what it is about ultra-processed foods that caused these effects.”

Some experts argue that ultra-processed foods hook our brains and overwhelm our biology because they contain unnatural combinations of fat and carbs along with sodium and other flavor enhancers.

Some nutrition scientists point to the texture of ultra-processed foods: They often contain little or no fiber and are easy to chew and digest rapidly despite being high in calories. Think of how easy it is to scarf down fast-food chicken nuggets or a moist blueberry muffin packed with sugar, flour and vegetable oils. These foods are quickly absorbed when they leave the stomach and enter the small intestine, which causes a spike in blood sugar, insulin and other hormones.

“All the bad things happen from big rushes of nutrients into our bloodstream,” said Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University.

Many ultra-processed foods are made in industrial machines that subject grains, corn and other raw ingredients to extremely high pressures and temperatures. This can destroy micronutrients and create new compounds that can be harmful, including carcinogens, said Carlos A. Monteiro, an expert on ultra-processed foods and a professor of nutrition and public health at the School of Public Health at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.

“These foods contain many chemical compounds that are not nutrients,” he added.

Ultra-processed foods often contain an array of additives whose effects on our health we don’t yet fully understand, said Mozaffarian. “It’s not just the salt and sugar, which are the obvious ones, but the artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, emulsifiers, stabilizers, guar gum and xanthan gum,” he said. “We don’t know that they’re innocuous.”

Finding less-processed substitutes

The simplest way to cut ultra-processed foods from your diet is to buy fewer prepared and packaged foods and to consume more whole and minimally processed foods. Instead of buying sweetened fruit yogurts loaded with additives, buy plain yogurt and add berries, nut butter and honey if you like. Consider skipping the frozen chicken nuggets and making these baked nuggets at home, which don’t take much more time.

You should also eliminate sugary sodas and sports drinks, which have many additives and little or no nutritional value. Substitute with sparkling water with lemon or lime, unsweetened teas, and plain water or water flavored with real fruit.

If you need the convenience of ultra-processed foods, you can check labels and comparison shop. Try to pick the products with the fewest ingredients. For help while shopping, you can pull up a website on your phone called truefood.tech. On the site you can type in a food that you want to buy — such as chicken nuggets or breakfast cereal — and in response the site will show you dozens of brands and recommend the least processed versions. The site uses machine learning to rank foods on a scale of 1 to 100 based on factors such as how many additives they contain and their degree of processing. The lower the score the better.

The site was created by Giulia Menichetti and Albert-László Barabási, two scientists at Northeastern University who study ultra-processed foods and developed a database of over 50,000 foods sold in grocery stores. You may be surprised by the wide variation in processing among different types of macaroni and cheese or that your favorite organic gluten-free chicken nuggets score higher than a standard recipe.

Menichetti said that replacing some of the ultra-processed foods that are staples in your diet with unprocessed or less-processed versions could lead to health benefits. “We’re not suggesting that you drastically change your diet,” she said. “We’re nudging you toward healthier eating patterns.”

In the meantime, other experts have called for aggressive public policies such as stricter food labels and health warnings that might push the food industry to make healthier products.

“It will take some time for people to change their diets,” Monteiro said. “But if people start to consume fewer ultra-processed foods, the food industry will be forced to produce more minimally processed foods.”

389,Bloating is an issue for 1 in 7 U.S. adults every week,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

In any given week, about 1 in 7 U.S. adults (14 percent), women more often than men, suffer from abdominal bloating — the sensation of having a full and tight stomach that might also look swollen, according to a report in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology.

The findings are based on data from a nationally representative sample of 88,795 adults who were questioned about gastrointestinal issues they had experienced in the previous week. Of those who reported abdominal bloating, more than half (58 percent) did not seek care, with most saying the bloating resolved on its own (32 percent) or was not overly bothersome (30 percent).

Others managed the condition on their own with an over-the-counter medication or lifestyle changes (21 percent), and some (8 percent) said they would simply be uncomfortable discussing the problem with their doctor. Bloating stems from excessive air or gas in the intestinal tract, most often related to digestion troubles. It also has been linked to various gastrointestinal conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation, and to a woman’s menstrual cycle.

Possible home remedies include herbal teas (peppermint, chamomile, ginger, turmeric or fennel), antacids, fiber supplements and regular exercise. In most cases, bloating starts to ease in a few hours or days, but health experts recommend seeking medical attention if symptoms persist or are severe or if bloating becomes a recurring problem.

In Elena Karpova’s household, the rumbling sound of a clothes dryer has become an unfamiliar noise. “I use the dryer maybe twice, three times a year, just when it’s an emergency,” says Karpova, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro who studies textile and apparel sustainability. Instead, Karpova prefers to air dry her clothes. Dryers, she says, are “energy gobblers” and when combined with machine washing too often can wear out clothes much more quickly, in addition to having huge environmental and climate impacts.

Washing “can be the most significant thing that you do” to your clothes, says Mark Sumner, a lecturer focusing on sustainability within the textile, clothing and fashion industry at the University of Leeds’ School of Design. Laundering a garment could cause it to shrink, become misshapen, fade or pill (when small balls of fuzz form on the surface of clothes).

“It can be really quite harmful to the clothes itself,” shortening the life of the garment and leading to purchases of new clothing, Sumner says. “And of course, let’s not forget about energy and water and detergents used in the washing process,” which can also release microfibers into waterways and exacerbate the problem of microplastic pollution. “It’s a double whammy.”

Making simple changes to your laundry routine, he and other experts say, can go a long way in helping you reduce emissions, save money and take better care of your clothes.

Understand the impact

While many people focus on manufacturing when calculating their clothes’ environmental impact, machine washing and drying clothes can often be a major source of pollution and emissions.

In fact, the impacts of laundry can be “on the same order of magnitude” as the production phase of clothing, says Roland Geyer, a life cycle assessment expert and professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

“People are washing their clothes more frequently than they ever did before,” Sumner says. According to Energy Star, the average American family does 300 loads of laundry each year.

A standard washing machine uses around 20 gallons of water for each load and electric dryers, on average, can use anywhere from 1,800 to 5,000 watts, or about 1.8 to 5 kilowatt hours of electricity per cycle, according to Energy Star.

Choosing more efficient washers and dryers can make a difference for the planet and your wallet. Energy Star certified washing machines generally use about 25 percent less energy and 33 percent less water than regular models. Meanwhile, certified dryers are 20 percent more efficient compared to standard dryers.

A household that uses washers and dryers certified by Energy Star could reduce their carbon footprint by more than 400 pounds of CO2 annually, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is equal to planting a quarter acre of trees.

If every American household swapped out their appliances for more efficient models, the impacts would be even greater. The combined cost savings would swell above $4.8 billion each year and more than 41 billion pounds of annual greenhouse gas emissions would be prevented from entering the atmosphere, the EPA estimates. That’s equivalent to the emissions from nearly 4 million cars.

But even if you have high-efficiency machines, experts say it’s still important to cut down on the loads of laundry you’re doing.

“Every time we put that garment in the washing machine, part of it is gone down the drain,” says Cosette Joyner Martinez, an associate professor in the department of design, housing and merchandising at Oklahoma State University. “Then we lose another piece of it in the dryer in the lint trap, so we’re disintegrating our garments.”

Know what needs washing and when

Aside from noticeable odors or visible stains, when your clothes need to be laundered largely depends on how the garments are worn and the type of material. Clothes that you exercise and sweat in, for instance, should be washed more frequently than the outfit you wear to work a desk job.

“Lots of people just have a T-shirt worn once and then they put in the laundry basket without thinking whether it’s clean or not,” Karpova says. “People don’t think about, ‘Is it clean? Does it need to be laundered?’ It’s just you go through the motions.”

What your clothes are made out of also determines how long you can go between washes, experts say.

Natural fibers like wool or cotton typically need to be washed less than synthetic materials, such as polyester. While polyester works well for activewear because of its moisture wicking properties, the material is “oleophilic,” or oil-loving, attracting oil from skin that can contribute to body odor. To make matters worse, research has shown that sweaty-smelling compounds can cling to polyester fibers and not wash out completely, leading to a buildup of odors over time.

The chemical structure and “fiber morphology” of natural fabrics are very different from synthetics, says Preeti Arya, an assistant professor of textile development and marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Wool, for example, is naturally odor resistant. The fibers can absorb large amounts of moisture which helps to keep skin drier, and prevent the sweat and bacteria that cause body odor from collecting. Wool fibers also have another unique property: The ability to trap odor molecules and only release them when laundered.

Odorous compounds, perspiration and oil are locked away in the center of wool fibers, Arya says. Even if you’ve been sweating, you likely won’t see sweat stains or smell.

On the other hand, she says, if you wear polyester for a few hours, “You have to wash it because polyester loves our body oils and odors.”

How you wash matters

Water heating consumes about 90 percent of the energy it takes to operate a washing machine, according to Energy Star. Changing your washer’s temperature setting from hot to warm can cut energy use in half. Washing with cold water can reduce your energy footprint even more. By washing four out of five loads of laundry in cold water, you could cut 864 pounds of CO2 emissions in a year, an amount equivalent to planting 0.37 acres of U.S. forest, according to the American Cleaning Institute.

Experts encourage using the cold cycle as much as possible. “The temperature that we’re washing with is often way too warm,” Joyner Martinez says, adding that hot water settings are only really necessary for sanitizing. Modern laundry detergents, even those that aren’t marked for cold-water use, are typically formulated to clean just as well at lower temperatures. While single-dose detergent pods have become increasingly popular, a debate is raging over whether they may contribute to the growing plastic pollution problem that threatens human health and the environment.

Keep in mind that washers use about the same amount of energy regardless of the size of the load, so try to only run your machine when it’s full. And consider using higher spin settings if your washing machine has the option, which can reduce drying time.

Some experts also caution against dry cleaning too often. In addition to the energy needed to power dry cleaners, traditional operations often use polluting chemicals that can harm human health and the environment. Some research also indicates that the chemicals can stay on dry cleaned clothes.

In January, the Environmental Protection Agency added 1-bromopropane, a powerful dry-cleaning solvent and airborne pollutant that has been linked to cancer and neurological damage, to its list of hazardous air pollutants — a designation that allows the agency to limit its emissions.

Certain clothes, such as those with heavy beading or embellishment, require dry cleaning. But some of the delicate materials that you might send to the cleaners such as silk or wool can be gently washed by hand, says Katrina Caspelich, who directs marketing and partnerships for Remake, a global nonprofit organization advocating for fair pay and climate justice in the clothing industry. Test a small section of your garment to make sure it’s suitable for hand-washing — any color bleeding, warping or shrinkage is a bad sign — and use cold water and mild soap.

If you do need to dry clean something, you can ask for more environmentally friendly cleaning options, Caspelich adds. Some cleaners offer professional wet cleaning, where clothes are laundered in computer-controlled washers and dryers that gently clean. Another option is liquid carbon dioxide cleaning, which uses pressurized CO2 in combination with other cleaning agents.

You also don’t always need water and energy guzzling machines and detergent to keep your clothes fresh. “Really what people are trying to do when they launder is to make [their clothes] smell good,” Joyner Martinez says.

If possible, Sumner recommends hanging clothes outside in the sun where they can be exposed to UV rays. Steam is another way to de-wrinkle and help refresh your garments. Hang up your clothes in the bathroom while you’re showering or use an at-home steamer.

Air dry more

Whenever possible, choose to air dry your clothes, experts say. “If you’re air drying, that’s saving the most energy,” says Joe Vukovich, a staff attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council who works on energy efficiency.

If you are using a dryer, make sure to regularly clean the lint screen, dryer duct and moisture sensors to maintain efficiency. Instead of using timed drying, choose the automatic cycle, which uses moisture sensors to determine when your clothes are dry and reduces the chance of running the machine for longer than needed. You can also dry loads of laundry back-to-back and make use of residual heat.

Advertisement

Newer dryer models also often use less energy to dry typical loads on low heat than on high heat, even though it may take longer to dry clothes, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

But if you want to increase your clothes’ life span, experts recommend avoiding the dryer. Air drying clothes that need to be washed more frequently, such as workout gear, can make a “huge difference,” Joyner Martinez says. “The life extension that we get in the product is very dramatic.”

392,Alaska’s northernmost city posts warmest winter temperature on record,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

At the northern tip of Alaska, the city of Utqiagvik on Monday reached its warmest temperature ever observed between November and March, when the mercury shot up to 40 degrees — 36 degrees above the norm. 10 steps you can take to lower your carbon footprint ArrowRight The record-crushing high temperature was six degrees higher than the next warmest December reading ever measured there, in more than a century of records. It marked yet another exceptional extreme event in a region that is rapidly warming because of human-caused climate change.

“For a station with 100+ years of observation to break a monthly record by 6F and a seasonal record by 4F is very significant,” wrote Rick Thoman, a climate scientist based in Alaska, in an email. He noted that Monday was “only the third December day on record to have a high temperature above freezing” in Utqiagvik, formerly known as Barrow.

Who turned up the thermostat? Utqiagvik saw its warmest day ever for the month of December, breaking a record of 34°F degrees set in 1932! This temperature is also the warmest day between Oct. 20th and April 22, passing 39°F set in November 1937. #akwx pic.twitter.com/ya90r7ZXKN — NWS Fairbanks (@NWSFairbanks) December 5, 2022

The extraordinary temperature came at the conclusion of a recent warm spell and more than two weeks since the sun last set in the city more than 300 miles north of the Arctic Circle. The sun won’t rise there again until late January. Despite plunging into total darkness, the city and much of the Arctic have witnessed unseasonably mild air in recent days.

Record temperatures in the upper 30s and lower 40s were widespread across Alaska’s North Slope on Monday. Thoman noted that Umiat, about 170 miles southeast of Utqiagvik, also saw its temperature reach the 40s for the first time in December since at least World War II.

High temperatures Monday Dec 5th thru 430pm AKST. Most of the temperatures in the upper 30s/lower 40s are likely all-time December records, though only long term obs are Utqiaġvik & Umiat.

Some of the warmth across the region is traced to a zone of a low pressure to its west and high pressure to the south. Together, the pressure systems drew unusually warm air northward, before a cold front arrived, dropping temperatures back below freezing.

Thoman also pointed to open water in the Chukchi Sea, to the west of Alaska’s North Slope, as a contributor to the warmth. The loss of sea ice, because of human-caused climate change, allows the air to heat up more quickly.

Record-setting temperatures moved into the region late last week. Utqiagvik set a record high for Dec. 2 on Friday and registered its warmest low temperature for December that same day.

December is off to an atypically warm start across much of the Arctic. According to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer website, temperatures over the region average 11.5 degrees (6.4 Celsius) above normal.

The December warmth across the Arctic comes on the heels of a November that was the eighth warmest on record, according to data post to Twitter by climate scientist Zack Labe. In Alaska, temperatures up 10 degrees above normal were logged during the month.

2022 is on target to finish as one of the Arctic’s toastiest on record.

A recent study showed that the Arctic is warming up to four times faster than the rest of the globe and that numerous extreme events have been tied to this warming.

During July, a summer storm dumped 1.42 inches of rain in 24 hours in Utqiagvik, breaking the record. An increase in precipitation across Alaska’s North Slope is “surely tied to [a] dramatic decrease in late summer and autumn sea ice,” Thoman told The Post in July. That reduction in ice increases moisture availability.

Additional precipitation extremes have been observed in Alaska in recent months. Juneau, the state’s capital, saw its wettest January and February on record this year, and the interior city of Fairbanks was slammed by nearly 2 inches of rain in a December 2021 ice storm without cold-season precedent.

Climate change is affecting the state in other ways, too.

Unusually warm temperatures probably enhanced vegetation growth in Southwest Alaska’s sparsely populated tundra, leading to a record-breaking 2022 wildfire season. And coastal flooding — exacerbated by rising seas and reduced ice coverage — has hit communities in northern and western Alaska hard in recent years, especially as powerful storms, such as one that struck in September, batter the state.

393,"California snowpack off to promising start, but drought concern remains","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Winter is off to a running start in California, after a pair of December storms dropped several feet of mountain snow and soaking low-elevation rains across much of the state. Parts of the Sierra Nevada have recorded more than double the expected snowpack for the time of year, and another significant storm could be on the way this weekend.

However, officials are urging caution and conservation given the depth of the state’s water supply challenges. Longer range outlooks still point to a fourth consecutive drought year for the state.

Statewide snow water equivalent — or the amount of water contained in snowpack — is currently 175 percent of normal for the date. The Central Sierra Snow Lab, located at Donner Pass northwest of Lake Tahoe, is now sitting at 253 percent of its average.

43"" and counting on our upper mountains in the past 7 days! Snow showers will continue through the day, delivering 3-6 additional inches of snow on the upper mountain before the skies clear for tomorrow.



Today's weather blog: https://t.co/20cx54KnJ0#PalisadesTahoe #Tahoe #snow pic.twitter.com/OmOTayeCES — Palisades Tahoe (@palisadestahoe) December 5, 2022

Andrew Schwartz, lead research scientist at the lab, said that while these numbers are very good news, averages can be deceptive this early in the season.

He used a football analogy to put the December snow in context.

“We’ve scored a touchdown in the first quarter of the game, but we still have three quarters to go,” he said. “If we get to March and April and we’re still well above average for the time of year, then it’s time to celebrate.”

Water managers typically measure peak snowpack on April 1 to gauge the amount of water received during the heart of the wet season, after which snow is expected to melt and flow into streams and reservoirs.

As of Dec. 5, statewide snowpack was 24 percent of the April 1 average, meaning that California is about a quarter of the way to an average snow year. But even that solid foundation is not guaranteed to last.

“That’s not a static number; we could still lose that if the storm cycle shuts off and we get into a warmer period,” Schwartz said.

Recent winters have featured dramatic twists and turns that ultimately landed on the dry side.

“Parts of California are seeing rain today, but forecasts for the rest of winter are still highly uncertain & highly variable,” the California Department of Water Resources tweeted on Monday. “Last year we saw a record-breaking October and December which gave way to the driest January through March period on record.”

Those wild swings are expected as the atmosphere warms, with stronger storms separated by longer and more severe dry spells — both intensified by climate change.

For now, the storm door is expected to remain open. Multiple atmospheric rivers could make landfall over the West Coast in the next week, according to the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes, with a substantial storm possible in California this weekend. The National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center is also forecasting a good chance of above normal precipitation through at least mid-month, particularly for Northern California.

But the state needs a well above average water year, or several wet years in a row, to replenish its reservoirs, which have been depleted by three years of extreme drought — the driest 3-year period on record in California. Schwartz said the Central Sierra Snow Lab would need 60 feet of snow this year to make up for what was lost during that time.

Last week, the California Department of Water Resources announced that the State Water Project, which provides water to 27 million people and 750,000 acres of farmland, will again severely restrict water deliveries to just 5 percent of requested supplies in 2023. That number may increase if this winter turns out to be particularly wet, with a final allocation announced in May or June.

If dry conditions continue, more than 70 urban water agencies face potential shortages in the next 6 months, which officials believe can be remedied with increased conservation and other actions, according to a recent report.

“This early in California’s traditional wet season, water allocations are typically low due to uncertainty in hydrologic forecasting. But the degree to which hotter and drier conditions are reducing runoff into rivers, streams and reservoirs means we have to be prepared for all possible outcomes,” Department of Water Resources Director Karla Nemeth said in a statement last week.

Mount Semeru, the tallest volcano on Java, Indonesia, erupted Sunday, sending a massive column of ash into the sky and rivers of lava flowing down steep slopes. Nearly 2,000 people have fled their homes, according to a statement tweeted by BNPB, Indonesia’s disaster-management agency, which issued a high alert level and warned locals to steer clear of the eruption. There are no immediate reports of casualties.

Thousands of people remained on high alert Monday, Reuters reported, and authorities continued to ask residents to stay about five miles from the volcano.

Sunday’s eruption comes exactly a year after the same volcano erupted, leaving more than 50 people dead and villages blanketed in ash and mud. It spewed another massive column of ash two weeks later.

The 12,000-foot volcano rises above scattered villages in eastern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, where it has wrought periodic havoc for hundreds of years. Indonesia — which sits in the Ring of Fire, a rim around the Pacific Ocean known for volcanic and seismic activity — is home to more than 140 volcanoes.

Indonesia’s disaster agency said it has set up about a dozen evacuation points at schools, offices and village halls for nearly 2,000 displaced people, while emergency services continue their search-and-rescue mission. The agency is also distributing masks to help reduce the respiratory health risks from breathing in volcanic ash.

“Most roads have been closed since this morning and now it is raining volcanic ash and it has covered the view of the mountain,” volunteer Bayu Deny Alfianto told Reuters by telephone from the area.

West Java experienced a deadly 5.6-magnitude earthquake in November that killed at least 268 people. Though the quake was technically moderate, the high death toll was the result of a shallow quake epicenter and the region’s dense population.

395,"IOC delays decision on 2030 Winter Games host, citing climate concerns","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Concerned about the impact of climate change on the Winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee decided to delay choosing a host for the 2030 Games for at least 13 months as it tries to figure out how to hold a February Olympics on a warming planet. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The IOC has been in conversations with representatives from Salt Lake City, Vancouver and Sapporo, Japan, and there had been indications that one of those cities soon would be invited to hold exclusive conversations with the IOC’s future games committee — a final step toward being named as host for 2030. Instead, the committee’s executive board raised several questions about climate change at a Tuesday meeting.

After a long discussion that included suggestions that future Winter Olympics be held only in places that have average February temperatures of 32 degrees and the possibility of rotating Winter Games among a small pool of places guaranteed to be cold, the executive board decided the IOC needs to study its options before making a choice for 2030. The 2026 Games will be held in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy.

“We have preliminary results of leading academic research on the impact of climate change, which shows a potential reduction in a number of climate reliable hosts in the future reduction of number of climate reliable hosts,” IOC executive director Christophe Dubi said Tuesday.

Salt Lake City and Sapporo long have been considered the strongest bids, but each faced some resistance. There has been some reluctance to stage the Olympics in the United States less than two years after the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles. A corruption scandal in Japan related to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics has dulled enthusiasm for another Games in that country.

IOC officials said the delay in naming a 2030 city is not related to concerns about the existing bids and stressed the organization needs to understand the dangers of planning future Olympics in places that will be too warm to adequately handle them. A warm late autumn in Europe wiped out the World Cup ski season’s first few events.

IOC executives said they are comfortable making a late decision on a 2030 host because the three bidding cities have hosted Winter Olympics in the past and will not need as much time as other cities to prepare for the Games.

396,TSA now wants to scan your face at security. Here are your rights.,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Next time you’re at airport security, get ready to look straight into a camera. The TSA wants to analyze your face. The Transportation Security Administration has been quietly testing controversial facial recognition technology for passenger screening at 16 major domestic airports — from Washington to Los Angeles — and hopes to expand it across the United States as soon as next year. Kiosks with cameras are doing a job that used to be completed by humans: checking the photos on travelers’ IDs to make sure they’re not impostors.

The TSA says facial recognition, which has been banned by cities such as San Francisco, helps improve security and possibly also efficiency. But it’s also bringing an unproven tech, with civil rights ramifications we still just don’t understand, to one of the most stressful parts of travel.

Advertisement

After hearing concerns from Washington Post readers who encountered face scans while traveling, I wanted to know how the TSA is using the tech and what our rights are. Everybody wants better safety, but is this really safer — and what are its real costs?

So I quizzed the TSA’s Jason Lim, who helps run the program formally known as Credential Authentication Technology with Camera (CAT-2). And I also called Albert Fox Cahn, the founder of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, or STOP, and one of the biggest critics of facial recognition.

I learned the TSA has put some important constraints on its use of facial recognition — but its current programs are just the beginning.

No, you don’t have to participate in facial recognition at the airport. Whether you’ll feel like you have a real choice is a separate question.

TSA quietly rolled out facial recognition technology at over a dozen airports across the country. Tech columnist Geoffrey Fowler shares what to expect. (Video: Monica Rodman/The Washington Post)

How TSA facial recognition works

American airports have been experimenting with so-called biometric technology for years, following the 9/11 attacks. You might have seen Customs collecting biometric information from passengers entering the United States. In 2019, I tested some of the ways airlines were using face scans to replace boarding passes for international flights. The TSA’s facial recognition pilot began at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) amid concerns about covid transmission through contact in August 2020.

This system is for general passenger security screening. You step up to the travel document checker kiosk and stick your ID into a machine. Then you look into a camera for up to five seconds and the machine compares your live photo to the one it sees on your ID. They call this a “one to one” verification system, comparing one face to one ID. Even though the software is judging if you’re an impostor, there’s still a human agent there to make the final call (at least for now).

So how accurate is it? The TSA says it’s been better at verifying IDs than the manual process. “This technology is definitely a security enhancement,” Lim said. “We are so far very satisfied with the performance of the machine’s ability to conduct facial recognition accurately.”

What about people who don’t exactly look like their driver’s license photo? Minor variations in appearance over time — such as changing your hairstyle — have negligible negative impact on identity verification, the TSA says.

Advertisement

But the TSA hasn’t actually released hard data about how often its system falsely identifies people, through incorrect positive or negative matches. Some of that might come to light next year when the TSA has to make its case to the Department of Homeland Security to convert airports all over the United States into facial recognition systems.

“I am worried that the TSA will give a green light to technology that is more likely to falsely accuse Black and Brown and nonbinary travelers and other groups that have historically faced more facial recognition errors,” said Cahn of STOP.

Research has shown facial recognition algorithms can be less accurate at identifying people of color. A study published by the federal National Institute of Science and Technology in 2019 found that Asian and African American people were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than White men, depending on the particular algorithm and type of search.

Should travelers be concerned? “No one should worry about being misidentified. That is not happening, and we work diligently to ensure the technology is performing according to the highest scientific standards,” Lim told me. “Demographic equitability is a serious issue for us, and it represents a significant element in our testing.”

Advertisement

That doesn’t satisfy critics such as Cahn. “I don’t trust the TSA to evaluate the efficacy of its own facial recognition systems,” he said.

What about your privacy?

When some people hear about governments using facial recognition, they rightly picture the situation in China, where broad use of the technology makes it extremely difficult for citizens to evade surveillance. Does going through airport security now mean Homeland Security has a face ID that can identify you at a protest?

The TSA says it doesn’t use facial recognition for law-enforcement purposes. It also says it minimizes holding on to our face data, so it isn’t using the scans to build out a new national database of face IDs.

“The scanning and match is made and immediately overwritten at the Travel Document Checker podium. We keep neither the live photo nor the photo of the ID,” said Lim. But the TSA did acknowledge there are cases in which it holds on to the data for up to 24 months so its science and technology office can evaluate the system’s effectiveness.

What’s more, the TSA already has a plan to expand the scope of how it’s using the tech. It’s running a pilot of a second system at a few airports where you don’t even have to present your physical ID for inspection. Your face is your ID.

Advertisement

In tests with Delta, machines compare passengers’ live faces to a database of photos the government already has, typically from passports. For now, this system only works for passengers with PreCheck or Global Entry and passengers also have to request it from Delta. A colleague recently tried it in Atlanta and reported it was like an extra-fast version of PreCheck that probably saved him five minutes on his trip.

Just remember: Any time data gets collected somewhere, it could also be stolen — and you only get one face. The TSA says all its databases are encrypted to reduce hacking risk. But in 2019, the Department of Homeland Security disclosed that photos of travelers were taken in a data breach, accessed through the network of one of its subcontractors.

Your rights

So do you have to participate?

Advertisement

“None of this facial recognition technology is mandated,” said Lim. “Those who do not feel comfortable will still have to present their ID — but they can tell the officer that they do not want their photo taken, and the officer will turn off the live camera.” There are also supposed to be signs around informing you of your rights.

But does it mean you’ll get moved to a slow line, get an extra pat down, or a mark on your record? “You should have no derogatory experience based on you exercising your right,” said Lim. If you suspect that has happened, the TSA says you should ask to speak to a manager.

“What we often see with these biometric programs is they are only optional in the introductory phases — and over time we see them becoming standardized and nationalized and eventually compulsory,” said Cahn. “There is no place more coercive to ask people for their consent than an airport.”

Advertisement

Even people who care a lot about privacy often find their limits when it comes to airline travel. People gravitate to options that help them get through the airport faster — and it’s not hard to imagine ending up with a bifurcated airport experience, said Cahn.

Those who have the privilege of not having to worry their face will be misread can zip right through — whereas people who don’t consent to it pay a tax with their time. At that point, how voluntary is it, really?

397,Elon Musk wasn't wrong. Apps are breaking under Apple's rules.,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

This article is a preview of The Tech Friend newsletter. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Tuesday and Friday. You are not Elon Musk. (Unless you are? Hi!) But like Musk, you have reasons to be mad about Apple and the status quo of apps.

A growing number of companies are rebelling against app constitutions that were invented when the BlackBerry was still cool. Those revolts — and Apple and Google’s defiance to them — are making more apps annoying to use, costing you money, or compromising what you can do on your phone.

A few examples of app irritations:

* You can buy a physical copy of Ina Garten’s new cookbook in Amazon’s iPhone app. But you can’t buy the e-book version in the app. Six months ago, you could buy a Kindle cookbook from the Android app. Now you can’t.

* Buying a one-month membership to Bumble costs more in your phone app than it does if you pay for the dating service on Bumble’s website — $39.99 instead of $29.99 when I checked this week. No one tells you this before you click “buy.”

Advertisement

* You can purchase a subscription to the Disney Plus streaming video service in the company’s app. You can’t buy anything in Netflix’s app.

* Musk’s Twitter doesn’t plan to let people buy its coming verification feature in the app, the Platformer newsletter reported this week. You presumably will be able to buy the paid check mark feature on the company’s website, but most usage of Twitter is in its apps. (We’ll see if Musk changed his mind after meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook.)

Yes, this is bonkers.

Some of these app roadblocks are old, and you can work around them. And in most apps, it’s still easy to buy whatever you want. But in a growing number of cases, buying digital subscriptions or virtual goods in apps is broken.

You can blame Apple and Google, or app makers like Amazon, Spotify and Tinder that refuse to go along with the rules of Apple and Google as owners of the dominant app stores. They all deserve blame and they’re a little right, too. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Advertisement

But this isn’t about them. It’s about you. You just want to buy stuff in apps and not pay more than you need to. But sometimes you can’t or you are.

The increasingly busted app system is more evidence of how your experiences online are shaped by corporate interest rather than what you want. What you can and can’t do is completely at the whims of secret negotiations between Apple, Google and app makers.

I’m proposing a tiny consumer revolt: Think twice before buying digital stuff in apps. This is a pain and it won’t change anything. But hear me out.

One reason apps are a mess: Digital and physical stuff are treated differently.

Almost from the birth of modern smartphones, Apple — and later Google — declared a first principle of apps:

If you’re buying something in an app that exists in the real world, Apple and Google have nothing to do with it. But if you’re buying something that lives only as pixels, those two companies might be your co-pilots in that app forever.

Advertisement

That means if you’re buying a novel, you buy it from Amazon in Amazon’s app. You book an Uber ride in that app and only deal with Uber. If you bought a toy from Walmart’s app, you can return it to Walmart.

But in the parallel app world for digital stuff, you’re buying that Disney Plus subscription from Google or Apple — not Disney. If you want to quit or have a billing problem, Disney can’t really help you. Disney pays a portion of your subscription to Apple or Google as long as you keep streaming.

Apple’s rules on this have been firm for years. Google had been less strict but this year it essentially copied Apple. Many app companies and people who make a living on apps like YouTube haven’t loved Apple and Google standing between them and you, but they deal.

Some digital companies, though, are refusing to go along. Buy buttons have disappeared from apps like Kindle, Netflix and Spotify’s iPhone app. The “Fortnite” video game app disappeared entirely. Some digital subscriptions like Bumble, Tinder and Amazon’s Audible charge you more in their apps to offset the commissions they pay to Apple or Google.

Advertisement

The apps themselves don’t typically explain this because any words they say in their apps must be cleared by Apple and Google. But if you’re aware of the app store meshugas, you can buy a subscription on Spotify.com and use your subscription in the app. Ditto for Kindle, Audible, Netflix and others. If you don’t know this, you might just be staring at an e-book that you can’t buy or paying more in an app than you need to.

It’s fair to ask if tech bosses like Spotify’s Daniel Ek or Tim Sweeney from “Fortnite” are to blame for crippling their own apps in a spat with Apple or Google.

It’s also fair to ask whether the old app store principles for digital and physical goods still fit.

Twelve years ago when a Netflix subscription involved DVDs by mail, maybe it was logical for Apple to treat that differently from a Netflix streaming subscription. Does the distinction make sense today? Is it justified, as a U.S. senator asked last year, that there’s a completely different app system when you use Uber to meet a stranger for a ride and when you use Tinder to meet a stranger for a date?

What you can do: Consider buying on the web, not in the app. (Don’t hate me.)

Apple and Google are the dictators of apps, and you live by their commands. But here’s one small measure of control you can grab back.

Advertisement

If you are paying for digital subscription, a virtual product like a Zoom fitness class or an online performer you love, consider purchasing from the company’s website instead of the app. Again, you must do this for a handful of things like Netflix or Kindle e-books.

Ask yourself: Would you prefer to buy a Duolingo subscription from Duolingo or from Google? How would you feel if you paid more for that yoga subscription in the app instead of on a website? Are you O.K. with Apple getting $1.50 of your $5 payment to a favorite YouTube channel?

There’s no right answer, really. If you do pay for something virtual in an app, just know that you made an arrangement with Apple or Google, not Duolingo or Down Dog. That has pros and cons.

The advantages are it’s often easier and probably safe to pay for a digital subscription in your app using credit card information that Google or Apple may already have. Apple and Google can protect you if you buy something digital from a dodgy app. (These protections don’t apply if you buy a physical subscription or product from a dodgy app.)

Advertisement

Apple and Google also let you — although it’s not as easy as it could be — see all the digital subscriptions you’re paying for and quit ones you don’t want.

Personally, I try to buy most digital things in a web browser and not in apps — especially if it’s a business that isn’t swimming in money such as a news organization or a Twitch star. Paying on the web saves them from handing over as much as $3 of my $10 subscription fee to Apple or Google. (And it collectively might spare all of us from the app maker raising prices.)

I also feel like this is a personal veto against an app buying system that denies you the choices that you deserve.

This side step might not work for everything, like video game apps, for which there is often no way to pay for stuff on a website.

Advertisement

Look, I know this is a pain. You just want to buy stuff in apps! That’s what apps are for! Yes and no. Because of choices made by powerful companies, that is not what all apps are for.

399,"Amazon, Uber ads appear on Twitter pages of white nationalists restored by Musk","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

SAN FRANCISCO — Ads for more than three dozen brands including major corporations appeared on the Twitter pages of white nationalist accounts in recent days after Twitter owner Elon Musk restored hordes of banned users to the social media platform. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight Promoted tweets from Amazon, Snap, Uber and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, among others, appeared inadvertently on the pages of at least two white nationalists, Andrew Anglin and Patrick Casey, both of whom said their accounts had been banned but were restored recently after Musk took control of Twitter in late October.

In a vast cost-cutting campaign, Musk fired hundreds of Twitter of employees, including entire teams devoted to content moderation of the site, including ensuring ads not appear on content brands would find objectionable.

Advertisement

According to a former Twitter employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, the accounts must be flagged to prevent advertising from appearing near them — or they will be treated as ad-eligible.

Late last month, Musk, who describes himself as a “free-speech absolutist,” posted a Twitter poll asking users whether he should restore accounts that had not engaged in illegal conduct or spam. Last week, some of those accounts began reappearing on the site, and ads began popping up on the pages of some of the restored accounts.

Having ads inadvertently appear next to such content marks the latest challenge to Musk’s relationship with Twitter advertisers. Already, many companies have been leaving the platform in droves, including after Musk briefly launched a paid-for verification system that produced a host of accounts impersonating celebrities, political figures and major companies. Civil rights groups have called for an ad boycott of the site, arguing that Musk can no longer effectively police it.

Musk and Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon and Uber did not immediately respond to requests for comment. DHHS and Snap did not have immediate comment. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

Advertisement

Twitter and other social media companies for years have struggled to ensure advertisements do not show up alongside hateful or otherwise objectionable content. Twitter had made efforts to improve the advertising climate and continued to grapple with the issue even before Musk’s takeover.

Musk has said he wants Twitter to be free speech-driven in its approach to content moderation, doing little beyond the bounds of the law to restrict the type of the content the appears on the site. Since taking over, he has restored the accounts of former president Donald Trump, banned in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and satire site the Babylon Bee, which had been booted for refusing to delete a tweet naming Biden health official Rachel Levine, a transgender woman, as its “Man of the Year.”

In addition to restoring prominent accounts, Musk has promised amnesty for those previously suspended, provided they hadn’t broken the law or engaged in “egregious spam. ”

Advertisement

But the fast-paced nature of Musk’s changes to Twitter have opened the company to problems, including the botched Twitter Blue Verified rollout. A swarm of impersonators began posing as celebrities, politicians and brands such as the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, which halted its ad spending after a parody account declared insulin “free.”

Musk has said Twitter would make mistakes amid its vast experimentation under his new ownership. Musk has also declared some users and behavior off limits.

Last week, he banned the rapper Ye after he posted an image of a swastika and the Star of David. On Saturday, Musk said it was incitement to violence because he wanted to punch the artist formerly known as Kanye West.

On Tuesday, roughly 40 brands had ads appear on the white nationalist pages, according to a review conducted by The Post. Those included the Voices of the Civil Rights Movement, a Comcast and NBC-led effort to honor the legacy of racial justice pioneers. Media companies including USA Today and Morning Brew were also among the advertisers whose content appeared on the pages.

USA Today spokesperson Lark-Marie Antón said: “We are reaching out to Twitter immediately as this obviously does not align with our values or mission.”

The other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Department of Health and Human Services, through a spokesperson, said it was pulling its ad from Twitter.

“HHS did not determine where this ad would appear,” said Sarah Lovenheim, chief spokesperson for the department. “Having it appear on hateful Twitter channels is inconsistent with our values and we are pulling it down.”

The ads from numerous brands and organizations, appearing under the “promoted tweets” section of Twitter, populated on pages for Anglin and Casey. Anglin is editor of the Daily Stormer, which for years has promoted openly racist and fascist views. Casey has served as leader of the white nationalist group Identity Evropa and has aimed to mainstream white nationalist ideas into the conservative movement.

Casey said, “I have never described myself as a white nationalist — I am a paleoconservative — and the organization to which you refer ceased operations in 2019.”

Attempts to reach Anglin were not immediately successful.

Anglin, who was banned from Twitter roughly a decade ago, has written about his efforts to recruit neo-Nazis. “As Hitler said, people will become confused and disheartened if they feel there are multiple enemies. … As such, all enemies should be combined into one enemy, which is the Jews.”

“We don’t believe America needs to be 100.00 percent white, but we do think that America isn’t going to be America if there isn’t a European-America supermajority,” Casey said, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

A Health and Human Services public service announcement boasted “#WeCanDoThis,” referring to coronavirus vaccination efforts, under Anglin’s endorsement of Ye for president.

Ye has recently praised Adolf Hitler and said he would go “death con 3” on “JEWISH PEOPLE.”

Brand ads also appeared under white supremacist posts from accounts with display names including “No White Guilt Clips” and “White Power Ranger,” the latter of which posted a photo of what appeared to be a Nazi officer with a Hugo Boss logo, a reference to the designer brand that has apologized for its role in the atrocities, according to media outlets.

Underneath the Nazi post was a promoted tweet from domain name site GoDaddy, according to a screenshot viewed by The Post.

GoDaddy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Musk’s tenure kicked off with a reassurance to advertisers that Twitter would not become a “free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!”

He also said Twitter would not derive revenue from hateful tweets.

“New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach,” he wrote on Nov. 18 in a tweet. “Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter.”

Some Twitter accounts that had previously engaged in hateful conduct did not have ads on them. No ads were visible on the page of Richard Spencer, for example, the alt-right leader of the deadly Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville.

The former employee said that indicated a possible block on revenue-deriving activities from Spencer, but not the newly restored accounts.

400,Europe will soon allow phone calls on flights. Will the U.S. be next?,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

You can soon say goodbye to airplane mode — at least in Europe. The European Commission ruled late last month to permit airlines to provide 5G connectivity to passengers on board, including for phone calls and high-speed data. E.U. member states have until the end of June 2023 to set aside 5G frequency bands for planes.

“5G will enable innovative services for people and growth opportunities for European companies,” Thierry Breton, the E.U.’s commissioner for the internal market, said in making the announcement. “The sky is no longer a limit when it comes to possibilities offered by super-fast, high-capacity connectivity.”

The E.U. move diverges sharply from the United States, where fears of 5G antennas on the ground interfering with aircraft equipment led to flight cancellations and diversions early this year. Cell carriers are still limiting 5G near airports until airlines can retrofit their planes.

Here’s why the experts said Europe’s decision is not likely to spark the end of airplane mode in U.S. skies.

Europe uses different frequencies for 5G

U.S. airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration have been concerned that 5G could interfere with planes’ radio altimeters, which measure altitude and are critical for landings in low visibility. Altimeters operate at frequencies of around 4.2 to 4.4 GHz, and certain altimeters without modern filtering technology can pick up interference from devices operating in nearby frequencies.

5G networks in the U.S. use 3.7 and 3.98 GHz, which provides relatively little “gap spacing” from the altimeter frequency, said Shrihari Pandit, co-founder and CEO of the internet provider Stealth Communications.

“If you don’t have this type of [filter] to keep the signal in sync, it can pick up background noise, like from onboard devices, and that could alter the readings,” Pandit said.

Cell carriers and the aviation industry have presented conflicting studies on how 5G affects altimeters. Airlines are retrofitting their planes to improve altimeter sensitivity or add metal shielding to reduce interference from 5G; they recently asked cell carriers for an extension from July 2023 to the end of 2023 complete the upgrades, according to Reuters.

In Europe, however, 5G operates at a frequency band of 5 GHz and above, providing significantly more gap spacing from the altimeter frequency and reducing the concern for airlines.

“There is much less prospect of interference,” Dai Whittingham, CEO of the U.K. Flight Safety Committee, told the BBC. “We have a different set of frequencies for 5G, and there are lower power settings than those that have been allowed in the U.S.”

Aircrafts are a ‘tin can’

Pandit said another concern, even in Europe, is the output power from hundreds of devices collectively searching for signal within the “tin can” of an aircraft.

Cellphones send out their strongest signals as they’re trying to connect with an antenna, meaning the “cumulative power output is going to be pretty significant,” he said.

It is unclear what impact such a powerful signal could have, but it raises concerns for electronic aircraft equipment and passengers’ health, he said. Aircraft may need even more sensitive altimeters and RF shielding to prevent leakage from the cabin into the electronics below, he noted.

Tom Wheeler, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and now a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said concerns over altimeter interference are largely overblown.

“The reality is that the vast, vast majority of aircraft have altimeters that are shielded from the signals,” he said, and older models are being replaced or shielded.

Wheeler also noted that aircraft are exposed to powerful radio-frequency emissions when on or near the ground and operate without any issues.

“The airplane fuselage is being exposed to all kinds of RF emissions that far trump what cellphone in seat 10C might be doing,” he said.

European airlines will rely on router-like ‘picocells’

To provide reliable service in the air, European airlines will use picocells, according to the E.U. announcement. Picocells act as mini cellphone towers that send a low power signal over a small area, such as an aircraft, reducing the need for devices to jump between towers, Wheeler said.

Those picocells will connect either to satellite networks or networks on the ground, like a WiFi router or hotspot, Pandit said.

Wheeler said advancements in picocell technology largely alleviate the technical concerns that prompted the ban on airborne cellphone use in the first place.

Advertisement

“The result of [picocells] was that you could use mobile devices on airplanes because they weren’t interfering with the terrestrial antennas,” he said.

Feeling the technical concerns were out of the way, Wheeler led an effort by the FCC in 2013 to consider lifting the ban on cellphone use on U.S. aircraft. But he said he quickly ran into resistance from the FAA and the airline industry over an entirely separate concern: people “yakking” on their cellphones.

In-flight calls impact the customer experience

“All hell broke loose because it turns out that airlines and the FAA had been relying on that rule to keep people from talking on their cellphones,” Wheeler said.

The regulatory proceedings over the rule eventually stalled over customer experience concerns, Wheeler said. Then-FCC chairman Ajit Pai said in 2017 he stood “with airline pilots, flight attendants, and America’s flying public against the FCC’s ill-conceived 2013 plan,” Reuters reported, and the effort officially ended in 2020.

Wheeler said the U.S. ban on cellphone use in flight stems from a “different technical reality,” but any move in the direction of the Europe in lifting it would have to also consider the passenger experience.

Pandit said he is neutral on the E.U. decision, but prefers a quiet cabin and questions the need for 5G when most airlines now offer in-flight WiFi.

“There’s definitely applications for business — you want to be connected, but I’m just wondering, isn’t WiFi sufficient?” he said. “Almost all devices that support 4G or 5G will have WiFi capability.”

401,Musk defends bedrooms at Twitter headquarters as San Francisco investigates,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

San Francisco’s Department of Building Inspection said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint that Twitter had created makeshift bedrooms at its headquarters in the city, as new owner Elon Musk seeks to instill a “hardcore” culture at the social media company. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “We need to make sure the building is being used as intended,” Patrick Hannan, a spokesman for the department, said in an email. “There are different building code requirements for residential buildings, including those being used for short-term stays. These codes make sure people are using spaces safely.”

“No one is above the law,” he said.

The complaint — sent on Twitter to San Francisco’s 311 service — came after Forbes reported that multiple rooms in Twitter’s office were being converted into sleeping spaces, describing them as “modest bedrooms featuring unmade mattresses, drab curtains and giant conference-room telepresence monitors.”

Musk appeared to confirm the report, writing on Twitter: “So city of SF attacks companies providing beds for tired employees instead of making sure kids are safe from fentanyl. Where are your priorities @LondonBreed!?” He tagged San Francisco Mayor London Breed (D), whose office did not respond to a request for comment.

Twitter, which gutted its communications team in a round of mass layoffs after Musk took the helm, did not respond to a request for comment.

Shortly after Musk bought the company for $44 billion this fall and laid off an estimated half of employees, the new owner issued an ultimatum to staff, telling them to commit to an “extremely hardcore” operation or take severance.

“This will mean working long hours at high intensity,” he said. “Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade.”

Hundreds of Twitter employees refused to sign the pledge, leaving Twitter with even fewer employees.

The apparent installation of bedrooms at Twitter’s headquarters comes after a product manager at the company shared a photo of her sleeping on the floor of what appeared to be a meeting room. “When your team is pushing round-the-clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork,” she said in reference to the photo of her wrapped in a sleeping bag.

When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork https://t.co/UBGKYPilbD — Esther Crawford ✨ (@esthercrawford) November 2, 2022

“We are reaching out to building representatives so we can conduct a site inspection as part of our investigation,” said the Department of Building Inspection’s Hannan. “If we find suite 900 no longer meets the building code, we’ll issue a notice of violation, which will be posted to our website and at the site, just like all notices of violation,” referring to Twitter’s headquarters at 1355 Market Street.

“San Francisco treats all complaints and property owners the same,” he said, noting that anyone with “additional information or photos that would assist our investigation” could send them to the department by email.

Musk has advocated sleeping at work in the past and frequently referenced doing so himself at Tesla — the electric vehicle company he founded — during Model 3 production at the Fremont plant.

“The reason I sleep on the floor was not because I couldn’t go across the road and be at the hotel,” he told Bloomberg Businessweek in 2018. “It was because I wanted my circumstance to be worse than anyone else at the company on purpose.”

He reiterated the story at an investment conference in New York last month, according to Insider, saying he was “living in the factory in Fremont and the one in Nevada for three years straight.”

Just weeks after he took over Twitter, Musk tweeted to a then-employee that he would be sleeping at Twitter, Insider reported.

“Will be working & sleeping here until org is fixed,” he tweeted Nov. 14 in a now-deleted post, according to an archive of Musk’s deleted tweets.

402,"On east front with Ukrainian troops: Constant shelling, no heat or coffee","Europe On east front with Ukrainian troops: Constant shelling, no heat or coffee Soldiers from the Fifth Brigade of Ukraine’s National Guard emerge from a trench after a pause in Russian shelling near Kreminna, Ukraine, on Sunday. (Serhiy Morgunov for The Washington Post)

Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

NEAR KREMINNA, Ukraine — Deep in the forest and less than a mile from enemy Russian positions, the sound of incoming artillery landing nearby thunders every few minutes. The landscape is littered with unexploded ordnance, so the Ukrainian soldiers don’t dare step anywhere they have not before. They pack light because they might be on the move quickly — forward, they hope.

In their cramped, hastily dug mud outpost, they apologize that they only have tea — no room for coffee.

A commander manning one of Ukraine’s forward-most positions did not flinch at the roar of shells crashing close by as he zoomed in on his tablet to show how Kyiv’s forces in the area have advanced within five miles of Kreminna — an occupied stronghold for the Russian military and potential gateway for the Ukrainian forces as they press into the eastern Luhansk region.

“We’ve pushed them back, and now we just need to take their logistical routes,” said the deputy battalion commander in the Ukrainian National Guard’s 5th Slobozhanska Brigade, whom The Washington Post agreed to identify by his call sign, Tor, because of the security risks.

“As soon as they lose that, they’ll have to abandon their positions,” Tor said. “They won’t be able to bring in reinforcements or more ammunition.”

Less than a month after Moscow withdrew its troops from the western bank of the Dnieper River and the city of Kherson — the sole regional capital Russia had captured in this invasion — the focus of the war has once again turned to eastern Ukraine, where Russia has stoked armed conflict since 2014.

Here, Ukraine is still on the offensive. But the gains are slower and harder-fought than the surprise counteroffensive that expelled Russian forces from nearly the entire northeast Kharkiv region in just one week in September.

The fight here epitomizes the grinding pace that military analysts and Western intelligence officials expect the war to slow to this winter. Ukrainians have refuted suggestions of an operational pause, saying that would just give Russia time to regenerate its forces at a moment they appear weakened.

But Ukrainian soldiers concede that the battles in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, collectively known as Donbas, are tougher — perhaps reflecting the new priority of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his commanders: avoiding further defeats after the humiliating retreats from the north and south.

Putin has repeatedly said that the main goal of his war is to “liberate” all of Donbas, meaning losses in the region would mark a clear and obvious failure.

Front lines here are well-reinforced by second and third waves of Russian defenses. Sometimes reinforcements are brought in hours after a Ukrainian attack — often recently mobilized fighters.

Oleh, a company commander for one of the Ukrainian brigades fighting near Kreminna, said that after his unit attacked Russian positions in a village north of the city, drone reconnaissance observed two trucks bringing in more soldiers early the next morning.

“The enemy just brings in the mobilized in piles, and they just get pushed to the front, without any training,” he said. The Post agreed to withhold Oleh’s surname because he still has family members living under Russian occupation in his home Luhansk region.

“There’s a lot of them,” Oleh said of the Russians. “They just bring them here as meat.”

The Ukrainians are fighting to hold off a mass of enemy forces, including mercenaries, in the Donetsk region city of Bakhmut, currently the site of the bloodiest battle in the war. Their goal is to keep Russia from attempting to encroach on the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has started to make gains at the edges of the occupied Luhansk region, which directly borders mainland Russia. Multiple brigades are attacking on two fronts — from the north, toward the occupied city of Svatove, and here from the east, toward Kreminna.

Taking both would threaten Russia’s hold on the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, which Moscow’s forces captured in much-hyped victories in late June and early July, following fierce battles.

“Any failure for them now is devastating, so they’re fighting hard for every little piece,” Tor said. “They fought many months for Lysychansk, and they’re about to lose it.”

Mixed in with the inexperienced troops are veteran forces. Oleh said “Kadyrovites” — Chechen forces fighting for Russia — had stormed his unit’s positions over the weekend but took heavy losses.

“They don’t even try to recover the bodies of their dead,” he said. “Today, for example, they abandoned one of their wounded. We tried to help the man and evacuate him, but he didn’t survive.”

Oleh said contract soldiers from the Wagner mercenary group are also fighting in the area. Pro-Russian social media accounts have posted images of a vast “Wagner line” of defense — two rows of concrete pyramid blocks intended to stop tanks — stretching around parts of the occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions and even along the Russian border.

Earlier this month, soldiers in Ukraine’s 92nd Mechanized Brigade fighting on the northern edge of the Luhansk region, near Svatove, shrugged off those fortifications. “Boys, tell me, this … concrete triangle, would you shatter it with direct fire?” asked Oleksandr, a captain, who spoke on the condition that only his first name be used.

“Yes, of course, it’ll turn to dust,” replied a soldier standing on top of a “trophy” T-72 tank, which was seized from retreating Russian forces along with the equipment to repair it and the ammunition to arm it.

At that point, Oleksandr complained that the main thing hindering the Ukrainian advance was the mild, wet weather. Troops — and their tanks and armored personnel carriers — were literally stuck in the mud. But just a week later, a drop in temperature has made the battle ground firmer and more favorable.

The freeze also has its drawbacks. Soldiers in Tor’s unit posted in the forest near Kreminna are so close to Russian forces that they won’t dare to heat their outdoor living quarters, which could reveal their location to Russian drones flying overhead. They sleep in their coats, under light sleeping bags in the cold open air.

A week ago, they were some five miles farther back in this same forest.

One day’s events feel like a month’s worth here. There is just one narrow dirt road that winds into the forest. The Russians know it is a lifeline for the Ukrainians — used to bring in reinforcements and to evacuate any wounded — so they hit it constantly with artillery. At its edges are destroyed vehicles that in the past few days veered off just slightly to make room for oncoming traffic — and unluckily hit a mine.

Last week, while evacuating a wounded Ukrainian soldier with shrapnel wounds in his stomach and side that were causing internal bleeding, Roman Kabashnuy, a member of Tor’s unit, sped down the bumpy road to get the soldier medical help faster. The man screamed in pain from the back seat while another soldier tried to hold him down. Slowing down could mean death — more shelling could occur at any moment — but driving too fast could cause the wounded man harm, too.

Just an hour after Kabashnuy drove Post journalists up the road to the unit’s front-line position, the ride back looked different. New trees and branches were strewn across the road — signs of recent shelling. There was a fresh crater, too.

“Something has already changed,” Kabashnuy said, while his comrade rushed out of the car to move a fallen tree out of the way. “This is how we live here.”

404,U.S. troops to expand patrols in Syria despite tension with Turkey,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The Pentagon is preparing to resume full ground operations alongside Kurdish partners in northern Syria, officials said Tuesday, a move that risks further inflaming relations with NATO ally Turkey, which blames the Kurds for a deadly bombing in Istanbul last month and has threatened a ground assault in retaliation.

U.S. commanders restricted such movements after Turkey unleashed air and artillery strikes on the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which in tandem with American military personnel have kept a check on the Islamic State’s lingering presence in the region. The two groups have carried out only limited joint movements in recent days, to conduct security patrols and transport supplies between bases, officials said.

Three U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue, said it is possible Turkey could follow through on its threat to send ground forces into northern Syria this month, potentially jeopardizing the Americans there and upending what has been a relatively stable situation for the past several years.

“We are concerned with any action that may jeopardize the hard-fought gains made in security and stability in Syria,” Col. Joseph Buccino, a U.S. military spokesman, said in a statement. “Further, we’re concerned for the security of the SDF, our vetted, recognized and reliable partners in a place where we’ve withdrawn most troops.”

The Turkish Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

About 900 U.S. troops are deployed to Syria, most of them sharing bases with SDF personnel in the north. Those partner forces, Buccino said, are integral “to the ongoing effort to keep an ISIS resurgence at bay.” Among its responsibilities, the SDF oversees the al-Hol refugee camp, where tens of thousands of people — many of them the families of Islamic State militants — live in squalid conditions, unable to return to their home countries. SDF raids on the facility have rounded up hundreds of suspected ISIS operatives this year, U.S. officials say.

Turkey considers America’s allies a subset of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which Washington and Ankara have designated a terrorist organization, and Turkey’s leaders have accused the United States of complicity in the Istanbul bombing. The explosion ripped through a crowded area of the city Nov. 13, killing at least six and wounding dozens of others. Turkish officials arrested a woman after the bombing and claimed she had been sent from northern Syria to carry out the attack.

The SDF’s top commander, Mazloum Abdi, denied his group was involved.

Turkey has followed through with a series of cross-border strikes, including one late last month that Buccino said came within 150 yards of American personnel.

Farhad Shami, a spokesman for the SDF, said Tuesday that it had received indications that a limited incursion by Turkish or Turkish-backed forces might take place. “The Syrian Democratic Forces have no choice but to protect their people, the region, and fight to the end,” he said.

Advertisement

Shami accused Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of seeking to rally nationalist-minded voters ahead of a potentially tough reelection campaign early next year.

“If the offensive happens,” he added, “it will cause the displacement of more than 5 million people who live here, and ISIS will be active again.”

Mazloum, the SDF commander, wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece over the weekend that he believes the airstrike in proximity to U.S. personnel “was an attempt on my life,” saying it occurred near the city of Hasakah. He claimed that Turkey had assassinated several of his colleagues this year. He offered condolences to Turkey for the Istanbul bombing, called for peace talks between the Turks and Kurds, and said that past Turkish incursions into northern Syria have allowed pockets of the Islamic State to bounce back after the group’s near-total defeat in 2019.

“We call on the international community to immediately take concrete steps to prevent a Turkish invasion and to promote a political solution to the Kurdish conflict based on democracy, coexistence and equal rights,” Mazloum wrote. “The existence of our people and the security of the region depend on it.”

The situation marks the latest chapter in an eight-year balancing act for U.S. officials, who, despite objections from Turkey, turned to the SDF to counter the Islamic State after floundering in earlier attempts to find a reliable partner in Syria.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke last week to Hulusi Akar, the Turkish defense minister, in part to raise concern about the airstrikes that “directly threatened the safety of U.S. personnel,” the Pentagon said last week in a statement.

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, spoke Nov. 23 with his Turkish counterpart, Gen. Yasar Guler. By then, Turkish forces had launched more than 100 air, drone and artillery strikes into northern Syria.

A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Biden administration, said that the United States continues to “make clear both privately and publicly that we strongly oppose military action, including a land incursion,” by Turkey in Syria.

“The United States did not approve Turkey’s recent strikes in Syria,” the official said, adding that while “Turkey has legitimate security concerns related to terrorism, we do not believe that military escalation that destabilizes the situation in Syria will resolve those concerns.”

Bradley Bowman, a foreign policy and military analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said that without the SDF, the Islamic State would likely still hold broad swaths of territory, or that the U.S. military would have suffered thousands of casualties attempting to root the militants out on its own.

“If we want to keep the caliphate defeated and keep a lid on terrorist organizations, we need people on the ground, and that’s the SDF,” he said. “It’s in our interest to continue to support them and have them be successful, and Turkey needs to understand that.”

Bowman said that while some U.S. military officials continue to have good relationships with their Turkish counterparts, Turkey’s behavior in other ways has not been emblematic of other NATO allies. He cited Ankara’s purchase of the S-400 missile system from Russia and its reluctance to allow Sweden and Finland to join the military alliance.

“I just continue to see them doing problematic things,” Bowman said. The administration, he said, must make the case to Ankara that it needs to do more to remain an “ally in good standing.”

405,Argentine Vice President Cristina Kirchner found guilty of corruption,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

BUENOS AIRES — Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a prominent and polarizing figure in Latin America who served two terms as president of Argentina, was convicted Tuesday on corruption charges, sentenced to six years in prison and given a lifetime ban from holding public office. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight A panel of three judges found the 69-year-old Peronista, perhaps the nation’s most influential politician of the past two decades, guilty of fraud during her tenure as president for directing millions of dollars in taxpayer money to a family friend. She was acquitted of charges that she headed an illicit organization that engineered bribes and overpricing tied to roadwork projects in Patagonia.

Kirchner has denied wrongdoing and is expected to appeal. She has called the court a “firing squad” engaged in political persecution that’s aimed at keeping her from running for a third term as president next year. As vice president and a senator, she enjoys immunity from incarceration and the ban from running for public office until her appeals are exhausted, which will probably take years.

“A president is not accountable for the execution and administration of the budget,” Kirchner said in a live video on social media after the ruling was made public. “I do not legislate. I did not sanction budget laws. Those were the deputies and senators. I absolutely proved … that I do not have control over [that].”

She said she would refrain from running for public office next year. An attorney for Kirchner did not respond to a request for comment.

Prosecutors said Kirchner funneled money to construction magnate Lázaro Báez when she was president from 2007 to 2015. Several officials from her administration have been convicted in separate corruption cases.

During her tenure and that of her husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner, companies owned by Báez were awarded dozens of government contracts to build road infrastructure in the Santa Cruz province. The vast, sparsely populated province in southern Argentina was the Kirchners’ home province and the base from which they launched their political dynasty in the 1980s.

Prosecutor Diego Luciani called the case “one of the most extraordinary corruption schemes” in Argentine history. Authorities say some 46 billion pesos were awarded to Baez for 51 road projects from 2003 to 2015; prosecutors say nearly half of them were not completed.

Báez registered his company, Austral Construction, days before Néstor Kirchner was sworn in as president in 2003.

“Lázaro Báez, a friend of the then-president and a business partner, became a construction businessman overnight,” Luciani said during the trial’s accusation phase.

Báez, too, was convicted Tuesday and sentenced to six years, as was former public works secretary José López.

The ruling Peronista coalition is straining to draw support beyond its base. Forced to cut spending under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the government has been caught between its economic struggles and thin U.S. foreign reserves. It lost the midterm elections last year, and polls show next year will also be challenging.

“It is difficult to think of a time of greater political weakness for [Cristina Fernández de Kirchner], with record rejection levels of around 70 percent as her support base dwindles,” said political analyst Lucas Romero, director of the consultancy Synopsis.

“Her leadership in the party is totally undisputed, even after this sentence,” he said. “But this conviction consolidates her low-ceiling vote intention and is another reason for her to avoid running for president next year.”

In a recent interview with Brazilian media, Kirchner denied Báez was her business partner but acknowledged that he was “friends” with her husband, who died in 2010. Authorities have identified some informal commercial ties.

“In corruption crimes, there is never a receipt or invoice,” said Hugo Alconada Mon, a prominent investigative journalist here. “No formal record says that Cristina and Lázaro were shareholders in a company. But if it has four legs, a tail and barks, one can infer it is a dog.”

The conviction is a first for Kirchner, who has been investigated on several charges. She was acquitted of some; others were dismissed. They have included corruption charges, but also an accusation that she helped cover up Iran’s alleged role in bombing a Jewish center in Buenos Aires in 1994.

The verdict comes at a difficult time for this South American nation. Annual inflation is approaching 100 percent. Kirchner was targeted in a botched assassination attempt outside her apartment in Buenos Aires. When Luciani requested a 12-year sentence in August, thousands of Kirchner’s supporters took to the streets to express their dismay.

Supporters of Kirchner began gathering outside the courthouse Tuesday morning to protest the widely anticipated decision. They were greeted by increased security.

“The whole investigation is a setup,” said retired schoolteacher Carmen Millan, 73. “It is all lies, and we don’t believe in them. They only want her out of the political race. We are not going to let them do that.”

Former congresswoman Fernanda Vallejos, a Kirchner ally, rejected the verdict.

“It is a sentence written a long time ago, without facts, without evidence to support it,” she said.

But retiree Elena Brumana lauded the result.

“There are judges and prosecutors who dared to sentence her,” said Brumana, 71. “Many feared her for a long time, and now there is a lesser feeling of impunity. Unfortunately, a large part of the Argentine society will continue to believe in her.”

406,Quebec’s government wants to end mandatory oath to King Charles III,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

TORONTO — The government of Quebec introduced legislation on Tuesday that would drop the 155-year-old requirement that members of the provincial legislature swear an oath to the king of Canada. To sit in the Assemblée nationale du Québec — the French-speaking province calls its legislature the National Assembly — lawmakers must swear two oaths. One is to the Quebec people. The other — a pledge that they “will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles III” — is required by the Constitution Act of 1867.

With Premier François Legault’s conservative nationalist Coalition Avenir Québec government holding a majority of the seats in the legislature, the bill to “abolish” that oath is expected to pass.

Canada is one of 15 Commonwealth realms, countries where Charles is head of state. Several have been reassessing their relationship with the monarchy since the death in September of Queen Elizabeth II, a unifying figure more beloved than her first son.

The debate is particularly acute in the Caribbean, where the Black Lives Matter movement and scandal over Britain’s mistreatment of migrants from the British West Indies after World War II have forced a reckoning over the sins of empire and fueled new calls for reparations for the slave trade.

Polls in Canada show declining support for the monarchy, but casting it off would be complicated. It would require the agreement of both houses of Parliament and the 10 provincial legislatures, and likely necessitate the renegotiation of the Crown’s treaties with First Nations peoples.

“Canadians have been through a lot of constitutional wrangling over the past decades,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said after Elizabeth’s death. “I think the appetite for what it would take when there are so many big things to focus on is simply a non-starter.”

Irritation about the oath among provincial lawmakers in Quebec dates back at least half a century to the dawn of the modern separatist movement. It’s been particularly strong among the province’s sovereigntists — those who want Quebec to declare independence from Canada.

The latest spark followed the landslide reelection of Legault’s government in October.

Members of the sovereigntist Québec solidaire and Parti Québécois parties swore they wouldn’t swear an oath to Charles when the legislature reconvened. The “absurdity” of the ritual “had gone on long enough,” Parti Québécois leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon said.

“Whether people are federalist, sovereigntist … everybody feels this malaise, this discomfort toward an act that just doesn’t make sense,” St-Pierre Plamondon told reporters.

François Paradis, the outgoing speaker of the National Assembly, said last month that all of its lawmakers must swear the oath — no matter their malaise or discomfort. The sergeant-at-arms, he added, would be “legitimized” to expel those who refused to comply.

The 11 Québec solidaire holdouts later swore the oath behind closed doors, but the three Parti Québécois lawmakers did not. When they tried last week to enter the legislative chamber of the National Assembly, they were barred.

Jean-François Roberge, the province’s minister of democratic institutions, told reporters Tuesday that he would have introduced the bill even if opposition lawmakers had not made an issue of the oath after the election.

“I’m proud,” he said. “I think I’m lucky to have this duty.”

Quebec, perhaps more than any other province, has had a rocky relationship with the monarchy. Some view the institution as the personification of Britain’s conquest of New France in the 18th century and its colonial rule over the mostly French-speaking province.

Elizabeth’s visit to Quebec City in 1964 was marred by clashes between police and separatist protesters in what’s known as le samedi de la matraque — “Truncheon Saturday.” Charles’s appearance at a Montreal armory in 2009 was delayed by anti-monarchist and pro-independence demonstrators armed with eggs.

Quebec stands out in other ways. In the other provinces, the lieutenant governor, the king’s representative, reads the speech from the throne, the address that outlines the government’s agenda to open a new session of the legislature. Quebec has a lieutenant governor, but the premier, the elected leader of the government, reads that speech.

Support for independence has ebbed in Quebec, but Legault has championed a nationalism based on Quebec identity. His government passed a controversial law in 2019 that bars civil servants from wearing religious symbols such as the hijab at work, and he has called for expanded powers over immigration.

The bill proposes adding a clause to Section 128 of the Constitution Act — the one mandating the oath — that says it “does not apply to Quebec.”

Whether that’s constitutional is another story. Pierre Thibault, an assistant dean at the University of Ottawa’s law school, said he doesn’t believe it is.

“Section 128 … applies to all provinces,” he said. “If we want to amend Section 128 of the constitution, we need a constitutional amendment. It cannot be done unilaterally by a province.”

Roberge said he was “confident” the bill would withstand legal challenges.

Advertisement

A spokeswoman for Trudeau did not respond to a question about whether the federal government planned to challenge the bill and referred The Washington Post to comments the prime minister made in October.

“It must be understood that these oaths are governed by the Assembly and Parliament themselves,” he told reporters in Ottawa. “The National Assembly has the right to decide how they want to organize their swearing-in process.”

Trudeau added that he had no plans to abolish the oath for federal lawmakers.

Nearly a decade ago, a group of permanent residents challenged the requirement that new citizens swear or affirm that they “will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors.”

They viewed that portion of the oath as a violation of their constitutional rights to equality, freedom of religion, and freedom of conscience and expression. They argued that “the notion of personal fidelity to this foreign monarch is antiquated, undemocratic and elitist.”

Advertisement

In 2014, the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed their case, finding that their arguments were rooted in a “literal ‘plain meaning’ interpretation of the oath to the Queen in her personal capacity.”

“That interpretation was incorrect because it was inconsistent with the history, purpose and intention behind the oath,” the panel said. “The reference to the Queen in the citizenship oath is not to the Queen as an individual but to the Queen as a symbol of our form of government and the unwritten constitutional principle of democracy.”

407,Hundreds died on World War II ‘hell ships’. Now there’s an effort to identify the dead.,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

On May 14, 1941, Manila’s Pier 7 was teeming with military family members saying goodbye to husbands and fathers and waiting to board the ocean liner that would take them away from the war looming in the Pacific. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Three-year-old Nancy White and her pregnant mother, Chrystal, 31, were saying farewell to her father, Maj. Clarence H. White, 39, an Army doctor. The chaos on the pier would be the little girl’s first childhood memory, and the last time she saw her father.

Now, a Defense Department agency is about to seek permission for the exhumation from a cemetery in Hawaii of hundreds of unidentified remains of World War II POWs killed on Japanese prison vessels known as “hell ships.”

Clarence White may be among them.

“It’s a long-term project,” his daughter, now Nancy Kragh, of Seattle, said recently. “It may not get finished for the next five years. I’m 82, so I don’t know if I’ll live to find the results. … [but] it does give a lot of people some peace.”

Advertisement

The project would be run by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), based in Crystal City, Va., which works to account for the missing and unidentified from past wars.

It would require sorting through remains of hundreds of American servicemen who died or were killed during a grim odyssey in the bowels of squalid prison ships off the coasts of the Philippines and Taiwan in late 1944 and early 1945.

Most had been captured by the Japanese in the Philippines early in the war and had already endured years of brutality and privation when they were packed onto the ships bound for the labor camps of Japan.

Once on board, some starved to death or suffocated in the foul and sweltering holds. Others went mad and were killed by fellow prisoners. Still others were shot by Japanese guards.

And many were killed when the prison ships were attacked by American planes whose pilots didn’t know U.S. POWs were on board.

The task for the experts is like putting together hundreds of jigsaw puzzles from a huge jumble of pieces, with many of the pieces missing.

The DPAA is initially focused on a large group buried in a mass grave at Takao, also known as Kaohsiung, in southern Taiwan after the hell ship they were on, the Enoura Maru, was attacked by U.S. planes there on Jan. 9, 1945.

One bomb blew up near the ship’s forward hold, killing 300 men, historian Gregory F. Michno wrote in his 2001 book, “Death on the Hellships.”

“There was a blinding orange flash and a deafening explosion,” prisoner John Jacobs recalled, according to an account in the National Archives magazine, Prologue.

The next day Jacobs peered into a hole made by the bomb. “There were mangled Americans, some 300 of them, piled three deep and pinned down with large steel girders and hatch covers,” he recalled.

One of the casualties that day was Clarence White, of the 31st Infantry Regiment Medical Corps.

His right foot had been severed. He suffered on deck for three days with no medical treatment, fellow physician and POW Ralph Emerson Hibbs recalled in a memoir.

White died on Jan. 11, his daughter said. It was not until the next day that the Japanese allowed the bodies to be taken ashore, stacked on barges.

There, some may have been cremated, but most were buried on the beach, according to the DPAA and government records.

By then, Nancy and her mother, who was a nurse, were back in the United States, and her mother had given birth to another daughter.

The day they left Manila, she recalled, “the pier was just mobbed with women and children, and babies and baby carriages and babies crying and children making noise.”

Nancy had just turned 3. She and her mother boarded the liner SS Washington, bound for Hawaii, then headed to Los Angeles, where they stayed, she said.

Her mother shielded her from bad news.

“My mother said there was a war, and my dad was fighting in the war,” she said. “It was very vague. She actually put gifts in the mail to my sister and I at Christmas and birthdays throughout the war, so that we would think he was okay and sending us presents.”

After the war started, her mother got one letter from her father, she said. He was carried as missing in action for a year before he was identified as a POW. Then she got a telegram saying that he had died, when he was still alive.

When he was finally declared dead after the war, Nancy was 7.

“It was a huge shock because [her mother] had never indicated to us that he might die,” she said. “It was just that he was in a war and when the war was over he would come home.”

Her father had been among the roughly 1,600 prisoners who were first jammed aboard the hell ship Oryoku Maru on Dec. 13, 1944, from the same Manila pier where he had said goodbye to his family three years before.

Headed for Japan, the ship also carried Japanese soldiers, women and children, and looted items from the Philippines, including a Packard automobile that had been used by the American Gen. Douglas MacArthur, according to historian Michno.

The ship had also recently carried horses, and the POWs were packed into broiling holds that were still fouled with manure.

“The heat was terrific and the air stifling,” one survivor recalled. “Men were bathed in sweat immediately and began to pass out from suffocation and dehydration.”

The ship got underway the next day but was quickly attacked by roving U.S. planes, and it headed for shelter in Subic Bay.

But the planes found it the next morning and attacked again. As the ship sank, the POWs were only allowed to flee at the last minute. A photo snapped from an American plane overhead shows the water dotted with desperate, swimming prisoners.

Japanese guards machine-gunned some POWs in the water if they looked like they were trying to escape.

The survivors were transported overland to another Philippine port. There, most were put aboard the Enoura Maru, which made it to Takao, in Taiwan, in a few days. But it, too, was soon found, attacked and wrecked by U.S. planes.

Some men survived even that, and were taken on to Japan, where they were liberated when the war ended seven months later.

In May 1946, a U.S. graves registration team went to the Takao beach and began exhuming remains.

Of the hundreds dug up, only five were immediately identified, by their dog tags.

The remains were divided into caskets containing 10 “individuals” each and taken to an American graves registration depot in Shanghai, according to the DPAA.

They were then shipped to a mausoleum at the Army’s Schofield Barracks, outside Honolulu, and reburied in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu.

It is there that the DPAA wants to exhume and, using the latest technology, try to identify the hell ships victims.

“Some of them may consist of just a few bones or a few fragments of bones,” Gregory Kupsky, a historian with the agency’s Indo-Pacific Directorate, said in a presentation to interested families last November. “Not full, easily recognizable skeletons.”

Advertisement

In a 2018 test, the remains of what was thought to be one person were exhumed from the Punchbowl, only to reveal that the bones of four people were present, Kupsky said.

The DPAA must ask the office of the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness for permission to proceed, Kupsky said in a recent interview.

There are now about 40 caskets in roughly 20 graves, some of which contain three caskets.

The remains would then be studied and documented at a special DPAA lab outside Omaha, or the agency’s lab in Hawaii.

“We’ll do a full digital inventory of every bone,” Katherine Skorpinski, an anthropologist in the laboratory outside Omaha, said in a recent interview. “We’ll take measurements where we can” and assemble bones that seem to go together.

She said she did not how many bones there might be. But in a similar project to account for hundreds of unidentified sailors who were killed on the USS Oklahoma, which was sunk at Pearl Harbor in 1941, there were 13,000 bones.

After the inventory, bone samples would be taken for DNA analysis at the Armed Forces Medical Examiner in Dover, Del.

Once a DNA profile is developed from the bones, it would then be compared with DNA submitted by families of missing men to see if there is a match.

Theoretically, a DNA profile for every bone might be developed. “But if we have nothing to compare it to, it’s very challenging to make an identification,” Skorpinski said. “So having those family reference samples on hand is really, really important.”

Numerous relatives — alerted by DPAA outreach programs — have already provided reference samples, including Nancy Kragh.

“One of the lessons from this story is that war has multigenerational effects,” she said. “It’s not something that’s done and over and we all move on.”

If remains of her father are found, she said she would have them buried with her mother, who never remarried.

408,"‘Give me a few hours’: How Eisenhower, armed with only a typewriter, planned the U.S. response to Pearl Harbor","Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

At almost the exact moment hundreds of Japanese planes dropped armor-piercing bombs on Pearl Harbor — killing thousands of Americans and damaging eight battleships in a deadly surprise attack — Brig. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to take a nap. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Eisenhower, as usual, was working through the weekend. But around noon on Sunday, Dec. 7, 1941, he yawned and shoved aside the paperwork spilling across his desk in San Antonio, where he served as chief of staff for troops stationed at Fort Sam Houston.

Telling an assistant he was “dead tired,” the 51-year-old struggled into his car and drove home. Don’t wake me, Eisenhower instructed his wife, Mamie, before falling into bed: “[I don’t want to be] bothered by anyone wanting to play bridge.”

History compelled Mamie to disobey.

Eisenhower awoke to an urgent call from military higher-ups informing him of the news from Pearl Harbor. The next day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan.

The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed Congress. Here's an excerpt of the now-famous speech. (Video: Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)

Four hectic, harried days after that, Eisenhower received another call — this one demanding he “hop a plane” and travel to Washington to develop the U.S. response to Japanese aggression, writes Stephen E. Ambrose in “Eisenhower: Soldier and President.”

Advertisement

It was a pivotal moment for the nation and for Eisenhower, who up to that point had “impressed every superior for whom he had worked,” but failed to garner any accomplishments worth mentioning “with pride [to] his grandchildren,” according to Ambrose.

“Had he died in 1941, at an age when most great men have their monumental achievements behind them, he would be unknown today,” Ambrose wrote. Speeding to Washington, “[Eisenhower] may have dared to hope that the war would give him an opportunity to use his talents and skills … for the good of his country and perhaps even for the good of his own career.”

But things did not start well for the ambitious, anxious future president.

Eisenhower had packed a small bag, told Mamie he would be back soon and boarded an afternoon plane to the nation’s capital — only to be grounded by bad weather a few hundred miles into the flight. Undeterred, he boarded a train in Dallas and chugged into Union Station relatively early on Dec. 15.

Advertisement

He immediately rushed to the War Department offices on Constitution Avenue (at the time, the Pentagon was still under construction). There, Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Marshall met him with a stunning request.

Marshall, known throughout the military as an ingenious but stern and demanding taskmaster, fixed Eisenhower with a steely glare and demanded, “What should be our general line of action?”

“Eisenhower was startled,” Ambrose wrote. “He had just arrived, knew little more than what he had read in the newspapers … was not up to date on the war plans for the Pacific, and had no staff to help him prepare an answer.”

For a few seconds, an awkward silence reigned. Then, returning Marshall’s gaze, he replied simply: “Give me a few hours.”

He retreated to a desk, stuffed yellow tissue paper into a typewriter and — without any further preparation or research (and without the benefit of anything like the Internet) — came up with a strategy to fight the Japanese in the Philippines. His very first order of business: tapping out the title, “Steps To Be Taken.”

Conventional military wisdom dictated a swift retreat from the Philippines to Australia, where U.S. troops could build a base to launch a counteroffensive, according to Ambrose.

“But the honor of the Army was at stake, and the prestige of the United States in the Far East,” Ambrose wrote. As Eisenhower concluded in his report to Marshall: “The people of China, of the Philippines, of the Dutch East Indies will be watching us. … They may excuse failure but they will not excuse abandonment.”

So he formulated a daring compromise. Eisenhower advocated shipping pilots, planes and weaponry out to Australia in preparation for a base there, while nonetheless keeping — and, as far as possible, bolstering — U.S. troops already stationed in the Philippines under Gen. Douglas MacArthur.

Just as dusk settled over the nation’s capital, Eisenhower returned to Marshall’s office bearing his typewritten recommendations. He knew the plan was fraught with potential pitfalls: “We must take great risks and spend any amount of money required,” Eisenhower wrote in the document. “We dare not fail.”

Advertisement

Marshall pored over the pages, looking grim, while Eisenhower watched. Once he finished reading, he paused and regarded the younger man with a piercing stare.

“I agree with you,” Marshall said finally, in barely audible tones, according to Ambrose. “Do your best to save [the Philippines].”

Marshall placed Eisenhower in control of the Philippines and the Far Eastern Section of the War Plans Division, according to Ambrose. That morning, Eisenhower had felt certain he was embarking on what would be a very short trip to Washington. Instead, he would not leave the nation’s capital again (apart from a 10-day visit to Britain) for almost eight months.

During that period, he labored to the point of exhaustion in a desperate bid to save the Philippines and, later, to develop a strategy to fight Germany, as well as Japan. Eisenhower found a temporary home with relatives who lived in Falls Church, Va., though he hardly ever saw them.

“He never saw the house in daylight,” Ambrose wrote. “His driver would pick him up before dawn to take him to his office on Constitution Avenue, and bring him back at 10:30 p.m. or later. … He wolfed down his meals, often no more than a hot dog and coffee, at his desk.”

He missed Christmas 1941, countless family events and even his father’s death and funeral in March 1942. The only expression of grief Eisenhower allowed himself on the day of his father’s passing was to leave work slightly earlier than usual, at 7:30 p.m.

“War is not soft,” Eisenhower wrote in his diary the next day. “It has not time to indulge even the deepest and most sacred of emotions.”

Despite his work ethic, Eisenhower’s record in the Philippines is mixed at best. As Ambrose put it: “His efforts were worse than fruitless, as [General] MacArthur came to lump Eisenhower together with Marshall and Roosevelt as the men responsible for the debacle on the islands,” which the United States ultimately lost in a humiliating, morale-shattering defeat that cost tens of thousands of American lives.

Advertisement

Nonetheless, Eisenhower proved his worth.

“Throughout that period, and in the months that followed, Eisenhower impressed Marshall deeply,” Ambrose wrote. “So deeply that Marshall came to agree … that Eisenhower was the best officer in the Army.”

Marshall promoted Eisenhower to major general, then commanding general of the European Theater of Operations and eventually (by Roosevelt’s dictate) Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. As Supreme Commander, Eisenhower’s successful oversight of the D-Day invasion earned him a place in history and set him on the path to the American presidency.

The later glowing successes — both Eisenhower’s personal victories and those won by the Allied Forces in World War II — would probably have been impossible without those initial tense hours in Washington. Everything stemmed from Marshall’s decision to set Eisenhower a near-impossible task, and from Eisenhower’s refusal to back down.

Correction: A previous version of this story included a photo caption incorrectly identifying Eisenhower as a brigadier general. At the time the photo was taken, he was a full general.

409,80th anniversary of Pearl Harbor brings end to victim-identification program,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Twin brothers Leo and Rudolph Blitz were 16 when they applied to join the Navy. They were so young that their father had to go to the recruiting office in Omaha and give his permission. Rudolph wanted a Navy career. Leo wanted to learn a trade. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight It was 1938. Times were hard and the boys lived with their family in a two-bedroom house in a neighborhood of Russian immigrants in Lincoln, Neb. They enlisted that May. Three years later, on Dec. 7, 1941, they were killed when their ship, the USS Oklahoma, was sunk during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

For 78 years, they rested among hundreds of the ship’s fallen who were recovered but never identified, buried as unknowns in a cemetery in Hawaii. Then, in 2019, a remarkable Pentagon forensics project identified them as part of an effort to put names with all of the ship’s unknowns.

Advertisement

Now, after identifying the bones of the Blitz twins and almost 400 other Oklahoma men over six years, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) is closing down the program.

On Dec. 7, the 80th anniversary of the attack that plunged the United States into World War II, the last of the remains that could not be identified will be reburied in Honolulu’s National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific known as the “Punchbowl.”

“It marks the end of the project, of all the work that we’ve been doing” said Carrie B. LeGarde, the lead DPAA forensic anthropologist on the program. “Not to say that identifications [couldn’t] still occur someday in the future. But our active effort will be over.”

“It’s going to be … a little bit of relief, and excitement, and I think a bit of sadness too,” she said in a recent interview from the DPAA laboratory at Offutt Air Force Base outside Omaha.

“All the families that we were able to give these answers to,” she said. “It’s pretty emotional. It’s been such a huge part of my life over the last few years. I’m actually getting kind of choked up [talking about it].""

“We’ve done so well, but also thinking about those we weren’t able to individually identify …[is] a little disappointing,” she said. “But we knew that would happen.”

The battleship’s loss of life at Pearl Harbor totaled 429 sailors and Marines — second only to the 1,100 lost on the USS Arizona, whose wreck remains a hallowed historical site.

Most of those killed were recovered from the tangled wreckage of the ship, which rolled over after it was torpedoed by enemy planes, entombing hundreds inside.

With the limited technology of the time, only 35 of the dead were identified during and after the war. Six more were identified in the early 2000s, the DPAA said.

Six years ago, remains of what turned out to be 388 individuals were exhumed from the Punchbowl, where they had rested as unknowns. They were taken to the DPAA lab in Nebraska and to one in Hawaii for analysis.

Of those, 355 have now been identified — meaning that eight decades after the attack, only 33 of the 429 killed on the Oklahoma on Dec. 7, 1941 have not been individually identified, the DPAA said.

A complex identification task

More than 5,000 DNA samples were taken in the quest to identify the men, according to Timothy McMahon, director of DNA Operations for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System.

DPAA experts had to inventory almost 13,000 bones that had been on the ship and in the oily waters of Pearl Harbor, sometimes for months, LeGarde said.

After their recovery during the war, they had been buried, then exhumed for initial examination, sorted through twice, and reburied.

When they were exhumed again in 2015, they were found wrapped in white cloth bundles fastened with big safety pins.

The bundles were in 61 rusty caskets in 45 graves. Each casket held five to seven bundles. But one held 22, the DPAA has said.

One casket held nothing but upper arm bones. Another had neck vertebrae from five different people. Often a single skeleton was found to be made of bones from multiple individuals.

Some of the bones still smelled of oil.

Among the remains were those of Navy Musician 1st Class Henri Clay Mason, whose wife, Mary May, lived on Park Road, in Washington’s Columbia Heights neighborhood. He was identified in 2018.

Also, the remains of Navy Chief Petty Officer Albert Eugene Hayden, 44, of Mechanicsville, Md. He was identified in 2016 and was buried beside his parents in St. Mary’s County.

And Marine 2nd Lt. Harry H. Gaver Jr., 24, who was born in Annapolis and whose father had taught math at the Naval Academy. He was identified in 2017 and buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

There, too, were the bones of the Barber brothers — Malcom, 22, Leroy, 21, and Randolph, 19, of New London, Wis. They were identified last June. And the Trapp brothers, Harold, 24, and William, 23, of La Porte, Ind., who were identified in 2020.

‘A chance to see the world’

Leo and Rudolph Blitz had lived in a house that may have been built by their father, Henry, a German-speaking carpenter who had immigrated from Russia, said Mike Powell, 68, of Aurora, Neb., a nephew of the twins.

The house was located on “A” street in a community of German-speaking Russian immigrants called the South Bottoms, in Lincoln, Neb.

The Blitz family was a blended one. Henry’s first wife had died after childbirth, and he had married Marie Rebensdorf, whose husband had been killed in a railroad accident. Both had children with their first spouses, and then had several together, including the twins.

They raised a total of 12 children — six boys and six girls.

Joining the Navy was a probably a good opportunity for the twins, said their niece, Sandra Rebensdorf.

“It was a chance to see the world,” she said in a recent telephone interview. “But also, coming out of the Depression in a large family, it was a job with pay.”

“As long as the children lived at home, they brought their paycheck to their dad,” she said. “If you lived in a home, your wage went to the betterhood of the family. They worked for the family. They did not work for themselves.”

Leo and Rudolph, who were identical, looked so much alike that they could almost change places with each other.

“One letter we had from a shipmate said that one of them had a girlfriend, but they didn’t know if the girlfriend knew there were two of them,” Rebensdorf said. Even today, family members said, it can be hard to figure out how to tell them apart in old photos.

In one picture, they are posed together in their dark Navy uniforms, wearing caps that say “U.S.S. Oklahoma.” They look exactly the same, except for their facial expressions.

On Sunday morning, Dec. 7, 1941, the twins, then 20, were among the 1,300 sailors and Marines aboard the Oklahoma, which was moored beside another battleship, the USS Maryland, at Berth F-5, in Pearl Harbor.

At 7:45 a.m., the ship’s 24-member band, like the bands of other ships in the harbor that day, had assembled on deck for the morning colors ceremony. Lt. j.g. Aloysius H. Schmitt, a Catholic priest from St. Lucas, Iowa, had just said Mass.

Suddenly, the first of more than 300 Japanese planes appeared overhead and began bombing, strafing and dropping torpedoes.

Three torpedoes were seen streaking through the water at the Oklahoma, according to a Navy summary of the attack on the ship. They quickly hit home.

“I felt a heavy shock and heard a loud explosion and the ship immediately began to list to port,” Commander Jesse L. Kenworthy Jr. wrote. “Oil and water descended on deck and … the shock of two more explosions on the port side was felt.”

Another blast followed.

“It was now obvious that the ship was going to … roll over,” Kenworthy wrote. “Men were beginning to come up from below through hatches and gun ports and from them it was learned that the ship was filling with water in many spaces below.”

Word was passed to abandon ship.

As the Oklahoma rolled, sailors scrambled over its slippery bottom and jumped into the water.

Pearl Harbor was now a tableau of wrecked and burning ships, and dead and injured sailors, soldiers, Marines and civilians. The final toll of the attack would be 2,403 killed and over 1,100 wounded.

Two days later, in Nebraska, Lincoln’s Evening State Journal ran a picture of the Blitz brothers on the front page, saying they were believed to be aboard the sunken Oklahoma. The paper noted that the family was awaiting word of their fate.

On Dec. 23, Henry Blitz got a telegram from the Navy.

“The Department deeply regrets to inform you that one of your sons is known dead and that the other is missing,” it said. But the Navy didn’t know which one was dead and which one was missing.

On Christmas Day, another telegram came.

This one reported that Rudolph was dead. “Regret no additional information available concerning your other son Leo Blitz,” it added.

Not until Feb. 13, 1942, was the Navy able to inform the Blitz family that “after [an] exhaustive search” Leo could not be found, and had been “officially declared to have lost his life in the service of his country.”

Rudolph’s body was apparently not found either, even though the Navy had declared him dead right after the attack. In 1944, the Navy returned to the family some of Leo’s personal effects: a cigarette case, a bracelet, two pipes, and 90 cents.

Back in Lincoln, relatives all put photos of the brothers in their homes, family members said.

“As long as my grandparents kept house, the twins’ picture was prominently displayed in the living room,” Sandra Rebensdorf said. But Henry always felt responsible for their deaths, because he had let them sign up, she said.

In a window, Henry and Marie hung a small banner with two gold stars, signifying the loss of their sons.

Home to rest

The skull in the DPAA laboratory in Nebraska was in good condition.

It was probably that of a White male, who was over 18, based on an examination of the teeth and facial structure. Three front teeth were missing, and the unhealed sockets suggested they were lost at the time of death or afterward.

Research showed that dental records for Leo matched the teeth, according to a DPAA report on the case. A DNA sample was obtained from a bone in the skull.

Members of the Blitz family had been contacted about the USS Oklahoma project, and several had given DNA samples in the hope that they might find a match.

The lab had another skull and jaw, and a complete spinal column that it thought might be connected to the twins. DNA was extracted from a tooth, a vertebra, and bones in the skull for comparison with the family.

Examination showed the teeth matched Rudolph’s old dental records.

And when the DNA from both cases was compared to DNA from the family, it, too, matched.

Here were the remains of the twins.

“It was beyond a dream, or even a hope,” Rebensdorf said.

On Saturday, Aug. 10, 2019, they were buried in Lincoln Memorial Cemetery, where their parents rest, and a few miles from the house on “A” street where they grew up.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Mike Newell, a nephew of brothers Leo and Rudolph Blitz, lives in Aurora, Colo. He lives in Aurora, Neb.

410,How Pearl Harbor forced the world’s first around-the-world commercial flight,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Jack Poindexter walked briskly into the Liberty House department store on King Street in downtown Honolulu. It was Dec. 2, 1941, and palm trees swayed to the gentle rhythm of the trade winds that sunny Tuesday morning. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The chief flight radio officer on Pan Am Flight NC18602 needed a spare shirt. He had left California unexpectedly the day before as a stand-in for an ill radio man onboard the Pacific Clipper, a large flying boat — essentially a seaplane on steroids.

Poindexter had no clean clothes for the flight, which still had to make another stop in Auckland, New Zealand, and was not scheduled to return to San Francisco until Dec. 10. He had only a few dollars in his wallet, so this extra shirt was going to have to last him until then. Little did he know it would be the only change of clothing he would have for more than a month.

The return flight from New Zealand to San Francisco via Honolulu was interrupted by the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941 — “A date which will live in infamy,” as President Franklin D. Roosevelt termed it. That event, 80 years ago Tuesday, propelled the United States into war and forced the Pacific Clipper’s crew of 12 to make a dangerous — and historic — detour from their scheduled flight plan.

Instead of heading home by going east, they took the massive Boeing 314 in the opposite direction, flying blind with no charts and no support from the airline. They were shot at twice, narrowly escaped getting blown up and otherwise avoided disaster while piloting the first commercial flight to circumnavigate the globe. They flew more than 30,000 miles over vast expanses of empty oceans and remote landscapes on five continents while crossing the equator four times.

To top it off, the crew managed this feat without the aid of maps or radio contact, using only celestial navigation and an atlas obtained from a library in New Zealand.

“Flying around the world with no charts is astounding,” said F. Robert van der Linden, curator of Air Transportation and Special Purpose Aircraft at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. “They didn’t get lost and they had only one engine problem, which they fixed. These planes were beautiful, but they were hard to fly.”

The Boeing 314 was one of the largest aircraft of its era — nearly as large as a Boeing 747 today. With a wingspan of 152 feet, the plane weighed 84,000 pounds when loaded with passengers and fuel, requiring the full power of its four 1,600-horsepower Wright Cyclone engines to help it break free of the water’s pull and get into the air.

Pan Am pioneered the use of flying boats in the 1930s. A lack of airfields and the need for travel to remote locations made this unique aircraft a necessary form of transportation. A long stretch of calm water was all the landing strip this behemoth needed to reach populous seaports in the United States and Europe or exotic destinations like Honolulu, Fiji and Java.

Service on board the flying boat — essentially a glamorous luxury ocean liner in the sky — was exceptional, with gourmet meals cooked in onboard galleys and served in dining rooms. The Boeing 314, which could carry 74 passengers, also had sleeping quarters with turndown bed service.

Tickets weren’t cheap. The cost to fly one way from San Francisco to Hong Kong in 1940 was $760 — nearly $15,000 today.

“If you got on an airplane like this then, you were flying premium first class with a suite in an airliner today,” van der Linden said. “There were nearly as many crew members on these flights as passengers to ensure comfort and safety.”

Flight NC18602 originated in San Francisco on Dec. 1, 1941, with Capt. Robert Ford at the helm. He was a Master of Ocean Flying Boats — the certification pilots received once they learned the intricacies of flying such a complex aircraft. His skills would be tested to the extreme on this trip as the plane encountered all manner of obstacles, natural and man-made.

After leaving Honolulu, the Pacific Clipper headed for Canton Island, a refueling stop almost 2,000 miles southwest of Hawaii. The plane was approaching Auckland with 12 passengers on Dec. 7, 1941, when a bulletin crackled across the radio: Pearl Harbor had been attacked.

Pan Am was prepared for this eventuality. Ford had been handed a “Top Secret” letter just before leaving San Francisco. If war broke out, he was to follow his instructions exactly.

At the time, the Boeing 314 was considered state-of-the-art technology. The letter was explicit: If the crew could not deliver the Pacific Clipper to the American military due to attack or imminent capture, then they were to destroy the aircraft. Their fate was secondary.

As soon as the passengers exited the plane in Auckland, the crew began preparations for what was to come next. There would be no more passengers, or first-class service, onboard the Pacific Clipper from here on out. The rest of the trip would be escape and survival.

After a week in New Zealand, Ford received orders from Pan Am to fly west with his crew. His destination was New York City, which meant he would have to fly over some of the most inhospitable lands and seas in the world. Worse, Ford and his crew were on their own. They would have no support, fuel or even money from the company.

Overloaded with gas, oil, spare parts and provisions, the Pacific Clipper departed Auckland on Dec. 17 and headed for Australia. Just before departure, Ford was able to secure a $500 advance from the Pan Am ticketing office. That would cover food and fuel for the rest of the trip.

Just before beginning the journey, the crew had stripped off most markings from the plane on orders from Pan Am, presumably to confuse Japanese patrol planes. But the move also befuddled the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force in Indonesia. Dutch fighters, already in dogfights with enemy aircraft, now looked suspiciously at the large gray flying boat trying to land in Java. Over the radio, the Pan Am crew could hear pilots wondering if they should shoot down the intruder.

Ford maintained strict radio silence, as ordered by Pan Am. He flew without any sudden course corrections and landed the flying boat in the harbor. Ford then noticed a small tender with a furiously waving boatman, who shouted that the plane had landed in a minefield. The Pan Am pilot gingerly moved his aircraft forward and avoided any contact with floating explosives.

Aviation fuel was in short supply in Java, so the crew had to pump automobile gasoline into the reserve tanks. Ford decided to take off using aviation fuel and then switch to the lower-octane gas in midflight. The engines would run hotter and could suffer damage, but he had no choice.

The Homeric odyssey continued as the plane flew on to Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. Just before landing there, Ford eased his plane below the clouds — only to discover an enemy vessel about 300 feet below him.

“All of a sudden there it was, right in front of us, a submarine!” Ford later recalled. “We could see the crew running for the deck gun.” He quickly pulled back into the clouds and avoided the incoming enemy fire.

On Christmas Eve morning, the Pacific Clipper departed Ceylon — only to return an hour later. Just as it reached cruising altitude, a huge explosion shook the aircraft. A piston in the No. 3 engine had broken loose, causing an eruption of smoke and flame. Repairs were made, and the Boeing 314 was back in the air the next day, headed for Karachi in what is now Pakistan.

On Dec. 29, the giant aircraft lumbered over the Arabian Peninsula on its way to the Nile River in Africa. It flew over Mecca, where overflights were banned. Suddenly, the crew could see people streaming from a mosque and firing guns at the plane.

“At least they didn’t have any antiaircraft,” the pilot recalled.

Ford eventually set down on the Nile near Khartoum. The plane was refueled and back in the air on New Year’s Day, 1942. Next stop: the Congo River in West Africa.

Departures and arrivals are two of the most difficult maneuvers on a flying boat, which requires more than a thousand yards of calm, clear water for smooth flight to begin or end. At seaports, channels are carefully maintained and checked for debris just before touchdown or liftoff.

“A flying boat doesn’t land — it alights on water,” van der Linden said. “Coming down on a river is a lot harder than it sounds. You don’t know what’s in that river. When you consider the amount of fallen trees that must be in the Congo, in particular, it’s amazing. When you’re coming down at over 100 miles per hour and you hit something, you sink.”

The crew was nervous as the plane approached Leopoldville, now Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The river runs fast and features cataracts in several areas. Plus, the abutting jungle is thick with overgrown trees jutting into the water. Ford set the plane down safely, then made his way to the docks. As he exited, he was handed a cold beer by a member of the Pan Am ground crew, which staffed a small outpost there.

“That was one of the high points of the whole trip,” he recalled.

One of the most difficult parts of the journey still lay ahead. The flight over the Atlantic to Brazil would be the longest stretch over open ocean. The crew flew nonstop for 20 hours, covering more than 3,500 miles to the eastern tip of the country, which was about as far as the Boeing 314 could fly without refueling.

From here, the rest of the trip was anticlimactic. The flying boat touched down briefly in the Caribbean before resuming its journey to LaGuardia Airport in New York City, where it landed on Jan. 6, 1942. At last, it was over.

All told, the Pacific Clipper had logged 209 hours in the air and traveled 31,500 miles around the globe. Even though the plane did not return to its starting point in San Francisco, historians and aviation experts were quick to call the flight the first commercial circumnavigation of the globe, since the aircraft made it back to its country of origin.

“It happened at a time when both oceans had been crossed before,” van der Linden said. “And it was not the first around-the-world flight. Several pilots had done it before. But those were all planned trips with maps and coordinates worked out in advance. What you have here is a commercial airliner with a commercial airliner crew doing this completely unplanned journey while under threat of being shot down.”

The Pacific Clipper’s record for the longest commercial flight by mileage still stands today.

411,Building empathy in children takes practice. Parents can help.,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

“The challenge for parents is to cultivate kids’ capacity for empathy for people who are different from them or not in their immediate circle,"" Weissbourd said. ""So, different in gender, different race, different class, different sexual orientation. Different in political orientation and different religious orientation.”

Advertisement

That doesn’t mean parents should encourage kids to agree with people who don’t share their views, he noted. “They may fiercely disagree, but it is a matter of listening and trying to take other people’s perspective and valuing other people as human beings.”

Most researchers concur that there are three dimensions of empathy, according to Jamil Zaki, a Stanford University neuroscientist. “One is emotional, vicariously sharing what other people around us view. The other is cognitive, which is trying to understand what other people feel and why. And the third is compassion or empathic concern,” said Zaki, author of “The War for Kindness: Building Empathy in a Fractured World.”

A truly empathetic person must have all three, Weissbourd said. After all, “Con men and torturers and politicians and salespeople can take other people’s perspective.” That’s why the third aspect of empathy, which he calls the moral or ethical aspect, is so essential.

Advertisement

So how do parents encourage their children to be proficient in all three dimensions? “I think learning empathy is like playing an instrument or learning a sport. It's a lot about practice,” Weissbourd said.

Talk about feelings — theirs and others

One of the things parents can practice with kids is talking about and labeling emotions. This helps them recognize emotions in themselves and in others, which is likely an essential step for empathy.

It’s important that parents acknowledge and accept their child’s emotions, according to Tracy Spinrad, a professor and researcher in the T. Denny Sanford School of Social and Family Dynamics at Arizona State University.

In fact, parenting style is key to raising empathetic kids. There is evidence “that warmth and support in parenting is predictive of children’s empathy and sympathy responses,” Spinrad said.

Advertisement

That could be because warm and supportive parents are more likely to raise emotionally regulated children, and there is some evidence showing that “children that are better regulated tend to be children that display more empathy and helping behavior.”

Research in the development of empathy also supports the practice of talking to children about their behavior and how it affects others and how amends might be made, rather than punishing them or forcing them into offering an apology. “We want to make sure that children’s emotional responses are coming from something internal and not something external,” she said.

Teaching kids how to understand what other people feel

Weissbourd says that the tougher work these days, especially with older kids, involves understanding what other people feel and feeling compassion or empathy. “Most kids are growing up in quite politically homogeneous communities,” he said. “And there isn’t a lot of effort in schools typically — or in homes — to encourage kids to take the perspective of those who don’t share their political views.”

Advertisement

Practicing “cognitive empathy” — or understanding another person’s mind or what they feel — involves “having conversations that alert kids to how other people may feel in the family and outside the family in different situations,” Weissbourd said. “It’s talking about the news and having conversations with your kids about what people are experiencing in this country and other countries that might be different from them. It’s helping out neighbors and understanding neighbors who may be different in some way. It’s noticing and talking about the contributions that different people are making to kids’ lives,” including people who might not be on their radar, such as the school secretary or custodian or bus driver.

Weissbourd calls this expanding kids’ “circle of concern” and through this approach, “we’ve increased the number and diversity of people that kids have empathy for.” A study of the impact of “Facing History and Ourselves,” an educational program that uses lessons about racism and genocide to encourage social-emotional learning, found that middle school students who participated in the program “reported higher levels of empathy, prosocial behavior, and stronger participatory citizenship beliefs” than a control group.

Zaki also says that older kids benefit from a different approach to empathy — one that is peer-based. His Empathy Lab conducted an experiment that showed that seventh-graders who believed empathy was popular among their classmates were more likely to engage in empathetic behavior. Parents can help make empathy contagious by asking tweens and teens to point out examples of empathy they’ve seen among their peers and praising actions they’ve taken on their own.

“It’s critical that if we want our kids to be empathic, that we also recognize and celebrate when they do it, when they do something kind and we ask them about the kind of things that they do, just as much as we ask them how much they’re learning in math, science, and in reading and writing,"" Zaki said. There’s data showing that parents don’t do this enough: In a national survey conducted by Making Caring Common in 2014, about 80 percent of the middle and high school students polled report that their parents were more concerned about achievement or happiness than caring for others.

Challenges to empathy

But just as important as building empathy, according to Weissbourd, is “removing the barriers” by addressing stereotypes and biases with kids, including your own. He shared a story with his kids about an acquaintance who offered advice about caring for a cut on his hand. He asked if she was a nurse. No, she replied, she was a surgeon.

Advertisement

Another difficult aspect of empathy, Weissbourd said, “involves having empathy for people or caring for people despite their mistakes or their flaws.” He calls this “hard"" caring. To encourage it, parents need to give their kids permission to hold conflicting feelings about others, such as, say, an uncle the family disagrees with politically. Parents can say: “He can be generous and he can be a lot of fun to be with. And he’s been kind to you your whole life. You can have all these feelings for him. You don’t have to land in one place.”

Parents need to watch their own behavior as well, Zaki said. “Oftentimes I want my kids to be empathic, but then I get upset about an election result or something that I hear in the news. And if I act in a way that’s divisive, if I act in a way that’s angry, well, I have to realize that my suggestion to my kids to be empathic is going to fall flat.”

Finally, parents also need to keep in mind that the least-kind, most extreme, most toxic voices are often those that get amplified in today’s society, Zaki said. “And I think that older kids feel a lot of pressure to fit in with whatever culture is around them. So if we give them a skewed perspective that people are really cruel, they’ll feel like maybe kindness and empathy are for dorks, and they won’t want to express those.”

The challenge for parents is to remind kids that “despite what you read in the news, the people around you really want to be friends,"" Zaki said. ""They want to be connected, they want to be kind. And in many cases they are being all of those things.”

412,What’s a TGI Friday’s ‘Mozzarella Sticks Snack’ with no mozz? A lawsuit.,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The wheels of cheese justice might turn slowly, but they do grate on: A federal judge last week ruled that a lawsuit may continue by a woman suing because her bags of TGI Friday’s-branded “Mozzarella Sticks Snacks” contained no mozzarella, only cheddar. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Amy Joseph of Illinois purchased the shelf-stable crispy treats, which prominently feature a picture of mozzarella sticks, and claimed she was misled after discovering that mozzarella was not, in fact, an ingredient.

Judge Robert Dow Jr., issued a ruling on Nov. 28 agreeing that it was a “reasonable interpretation” for her to expect the product to contain mozzarella cheese. But he granted TGI Friday’s request to be dropped from the lawsuit, agreeing with the restaurant chain that it was merely a “licensor” who allowed its name to be used on the packaging. Dow allowed the lawsuit to continue with the actual manufacturer of the product, snack-food maker Inventure Foods, as the sole defendant.

The lawsuit is seeking unspecified “monetary relief” for the “premium” products that Joseph and other customers purchased.

Advertisement

Dow said it was reasonable “that a product labeled ‘Mozzarella Stick Snacks’ with an image of mozzarella sticks would bear some resemblance to mozzarella sticks, which presumably contain some mozzarella cheese.”

The companies had argued that Joseph should have known that such a product couldn’t actually contain mozzarella, since the snack she purchased is a shelf-stable product, often sold alongside potato chips and other similar snacks.

Dow’s ruling whey-ed in on this question, parsing the legal aspects of different types of cheese. He cited a previous decision in which a court found that parmesan was shelf stable. And he found merit in Joseph’s argument that plenty of crunchy, shelf-stable snacks contain other kinds of cheeses. “Defendant has not indicated why mozzarella is inherently not shelf-stable,” he wrote.

Inventure foods in a filing had called Joseph a “serial class action plaintiff,” having filed eight such lawsuits in the last decade, and noted that her lawsuit followed a similar one in New York. And the company said that it wasn’t clear what Joseph’s expectations were about the product, which discloses on the back of its packaging that it contains no mozzarella.

“It is well-established that a single statement on a product’s label cannot be taken in isolation and the totality of labeling must be analyzed to assess whether a reasonable consumer could be misled,” Inventure’s filing states.

Attorneys for Inventure and Joseph did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

“We are pleased with the judge’s ruling. The judge agreed with us that the claims in the lawsuit have merit, the case should not be dismissed,” Joseph’s attorney, Thomas Zimmerman, told USA TODAY in a statement. “We intend to proceed against Inventure Foods on behalf of the nationwide class of purchasers of TGI Friday’s mozzarella sticks.”

Dow wrote that he was skeptical of Joseph’s efforts to bring a nationwide class-action lawsuit. But he said it was too soon to declare that such litigation would be “unmanageable” given the differences in various state laws. “The Court is hard-pressed to state that Plaintiff’s class action is inherently unmanageable based on variations in state law at this early stage when it is not clear which state law will ultimately present an issue or whether similarities in some — though not all — state laws would justify class treatment,” he wrote.

414,Holiday baking tips for people stressed out by holiday baking,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

My holiday baking is best summed up by my attempt at fulfilling a boyfriend’s request for a gingerbread house. It cracked, it sagged, and it finally gave up and collapsed — much like the relationship. I tried my best, but ultimately, neither the baked goods nor the romance could be saved.

The truth is, I want to be someone who bakes for the holidays, but I feel stymied. How can I bake when life is chaos? How can I bake when vanilla beans are so expensive? And how can I bake when no one will like what I’ve made anyway?

So, instead, I’m that person who guiltily contributes a box of Trader Joe’s best and hopes to sneak by unnoticed. Each year, I resolve that this season will be different, but this year I decided to make it happen. For inspiration, I gathered wisdom from several baking wizards.

Cookie shirkers of the world, unite: Together, we can face unafraid the plans that we’ve made. Here are three common obstacles and how to get beyond them.

Obstacle No. 1: Disorganization

However full your calendar, it probably overflows during the holidays. Baking can feel like an unwelcome extra bit of insanity, but it doesn’t have to. Sarah Jampel, recipe developer and test kitchen manager for King Arthur Baking, says that pre-measuring dry ingredients for your recipes cuts prep time significantly: “Just be sure to label the containers with contents and amounts so you don’t mix them up.”

She also advises printing recipes and noting bake temperatures, times and pan sizes (or other required equipment, like cutters, sifters, mixers and thermometers) at the top of the page. “You’ll avoid accidentally baking your cookies at too high of a temperature, you’ll make sure you have all of the equipment you need, and you can make a list of [baking order], starting with the lower temperature bakes and working your way up,” she said.

Advertisement

Working ahead also can relieve holiday gridlock. “You can even start holiday baking [early] and freeze things,” said Dorothy Kern, who blogs at Crazy for Crust. If you have storage space, you can make most cookie doughs and refrigerate or even freeze them. If you want to actually bake ahead and freeze, brownies and bar cookies are particularly good choices, Kern said.

Obstacle No. 2: Expense

Sugar and chocolate are pricey enough, but add in specialty ingredients and it could break your budget. That’s why Dan Pelosi, food and lifestyle creator of GrossyPelosi, encourages the inexperienced to start with simple, well-tested recipes. “My Peanut Butter Blossoms use normal pantry ingredients, even for non-bakers,” he said. “The hardest part is peeling the wrappers off the chocolate Kisses, and they are always the most popular cookies on the table.”

If you must have a pricey ingredient, Pelosi tries friends and family first, then encourages buying just the minimum. “Go to a bulk store and see if you can buy just the exact amount you need,” he said. If you belong to a neighborhood Buy Nothing group or have friends to ask (the women in my local She Runs This Town are so helpful), see if someone has what you need and wouldn’t mind offering up a bit — obviously, in exchange for some cookies.

Paul Arguin and Chris Taylor, authors of the new “Fabulous Modern Cookies,” support a well-placed swap of like for like, saving money and frazzle. “For example, macadamia nuts are delicious, but also very pricey. Substituting another type of nut, like cashews, is smart,” Arguin said. “Will the cookie taste exactly the same? No, but if you’re saving $10 per pound, it might be good enough.”

While essential ingredients, such as almond paste, are absolutes, Jampel pointed out that some ingredients can be skipped completely, if not subbed. “Check out the recipe’s reviews for successful substitutions,” she added.

Obstacle No. 3: Fear of failure

Ultimately, people like cookies and they’re not going to blast you for your efforts (forgetting a dear friend who called the chocolate chip cookies I made for his birthday “a little dry”). “We see baking as a form of love,” Taylor said. “If you are baking with love, it doesn’t matter if your cookies end up a little misshapen or darker at the edges.”

They also mentioned that cookies are much easier to make the second time around, once you’ve done a trial batch. “If you have the time, budget and patience, you can remake anything you’re not happy with.”

But if you’re still feeling less than confident, Kern has the solution: Employ sweet camouflage. “Slap on some frosting and a generous amount of colorful sprinkles and no one will notice,” she said.

“Release expectations of perfection,” Pelosi said. “Let a mess happen. People can taste the energy that goes into what you are baking, so make sure it’s delicious.”

If the mood stays light and sweet, the cookies will be the same.

415,U.S. judge dismisses lawsuit against Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi’s death,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Despite “credible allegations” of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s involvement in the 2018 killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. federal judge on Tuesday ordered a lawsuit against the Saudi royal to be dismissed. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The basis for the decision, wrote Judge John D. Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, was the legal protections the prince is entitled to in his new role as Saudi Arabia’s prime minister.

“The United States has informed the court that he is immune, and Mohammed is therefore ‘entitled to head of state immunity … while he remains in office,’” Bates wrote in the Tuesday filing, which also dismissed the claims against two senior Saudi officials due to a lack of adequate proof in establishing the court’s jurisdiction over their case.

Last month, the Biden administration determined that Mohammed — also known as MBS — was immune from the suit brought forth in 2020 by Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, and the civil rights organization he founded before his death, DAWN, given his appointment as “sitting head of government.” On Sept. 27, Mohammed was named prime minister by his father, King Salman — just six days before the U.S. State Department’s court-imposed deadline to determine whether Mohammed was protected from legal action.

On Oct. 2, 2018, Saudi agents killed Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. What has been done in the aftermath? (Video: Joyce Lee, Thomas LeGro, Dalton Bennett, John Parks/The Washington Post)

The move was decried by DAWN as a “last ditch effort to escape the jurisdiction of the court.”

“DAWN’s lawsuit against [Mohammed] bin Salman (MBS) for his ruthless murder of Jamal Khashoggi is only one part of our continued efforts for justice and accountability for this crime, and the many other crimes the Saudi government is perpetrating against its own citizens,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the organization’s executive director, said in a statement. “While we are disappointed in the decision, we will consider all options to continue our legal challenges to MBS’s criminal behavior.”

Mohammed has said he takes responsibility for the murder but has denied any personal role in the brutal killing — one that sent shock waves across the world after a U.N. investigation found that the Washington Post columnist had been a victim of a “deliberate, premeditated execution” at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The CIA also determined months after Khashoggi’s death that the prince had ordered the assassination.

As a candidate in 2019, President Biden vowed on the campaign trail to make Mohammed a “pariah” and pledged that accountability for the torture and dismemberment of the journalist would follow. Three years later, a meeting between the two leaders in Saudi Arabia — and the fist-bump with which Biden and Mohammed greeted each other — was widely condemned online.

Ahead of Biden’s trip in July to the Middle Eastern kingdom, Cengiz wrote an op-ed published by The Post imploring the president to “uphold your promise to pursue justice for Jamal.”

“President Biden, imagine yourself in my position, trying to move on while knowing that the people who killed your loved one are still free,” Cengiz wrote. “Imagine the trauma of knowing that what happened to your loved one can and will happen to someone else because the perpetrators know there will be no consequences.”

416,My column was misconstrued in a Supreme Court brief,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

A Colorado marketing and graphic design entrepreneur, Lorie Smith, would like to expand into the fizzy and fraught business of wedding websites where engaged couples can tell the story of their relationship, provide guests with travel and hotel details, offer links to their gift registry and have a central location to post all manner of logistical information. What Smith doesn’t want to do is make wedding websites for same-sex couples because she has a religious objection to such marriages. Her objection creates an obstacle to her expansion dreams because Colorado law prohibits businesses from discriminating based on gender and sexual identity. A business owner can’t refuse service to customers because they’re LGBTQ. And so Smith has taken her case to the Supreme Court where oral arguments were heard Monday.

To support her case, her legal team referenced a column I wrote in 2017. Smith is likening her refusal of same-sex couples to American fashion designers’ boycott of first lady Melania Trump. Both cases, Smith believes, are examples of artists owning their own voice. They are about having the freedom to speak or not speak. The state can’t compel a person to endorse something they do not support.

This is not what I had in mind when writing that column.

Like a lot of Supreme Court cases, Smith’s is both straightforward and complicated. This one is rooted in a hypothetical. No same-sex couple has asked Smith to create a wedding website. This case is aimed at giving Smith the right to discriminate at some point in the future. It’s looking ahead to allow for a future shame.

From Smith’s perspective, her company 303 Creative isn’t trying to discriminate against gay people — only against their weddings, which also means their love, their creation of family. She doesn’t see herself refusing them service in the manner of a restaurateur who refuses to seat Black people or a sports club that won’t allow women. That’s because she doesn’t define herself as a merchant selling a product but as an artist crafting a message. “A web designer is the painter of the information age,” reads the brief.

Smith argues that she’s not trafficking in generic widgets but in a form of personal expression for hire. She’s telling her truth in the form of bytes and algorithms. Her websites are an expression of her politics, her spirituality, her inner musings. “As a Christian who believes that God gave me the creative gifts that are expressed through this business, I have always strived to honor Him in how I operate it,” reads her company’s origin story.

Fashion designers also view their work as an expression of their beliefs, as a form of protest and, in some cases, passionate advocacy. “In the same way that a poet’s words or a musician’s lyrics are a deeply personal reflection of the person who wrote them, a fashion designer’s work can be equally as intimate. In many ways, it’s why we are drawn to them,” I wrote. “We feel a one-to-one connection.”

While designers may not embroider an actual political treatise onto a frock, they tell stories about sustainability, culture, gender and status through fabric choice, color and silhouette. And, in some cases, philosophical exhortations actually are writ large, as with the “Tax the rich” evening gown that designer Aurora James created for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to wear the Met Gala in 2021.

While some American designers separated the role of first lady from the person who was serving in it, others felt that dressing Trump would be akin to an endorsement of the 45th president.

“Merely doing business with the Trumps was an intolerable notion to creative professionals who abhorred the Trump family’s political methods and messages,” the brief supporting Smith’s case reads.

Fashion designers were not refusing to sell their wares to Trump. There was nothing to prevent the first lady from walking into a boutique and purchasing anything she wanted and she did. Designers — some of them — refused to conjure a custom creation for her. Doing so would not have been part of their advertised services; it would have been an indulgence, one they offer to certain celebrities, particularly loyal customers and, yes, previous first ladies. They weren’t interested in collaborating on an evening gown for a state event because doing so, doing this exceptional thing, could be construed as an endorsement of an administration that had already begun to show its divisiveness and vitriol.

Smith is arguing that this is what she’s doing, too. But all of her websites are individually crafted. They are all bespoke. So, in effect, Smith is refusing to do for same-sex couples what she is willing to do for all other couples. She is the tailor who takes everyone’s measurements to create a singular product but refuses Black people or gay people or the disabled.

“The creation of a website, from pictures to prose, is the product of a connection between designer and client,” the brief reads. Smith considers her work an intimate transaction. Human to human. So it’s striking that part of what sparked this lawsuit is Smith’s desire to post a public statement announcing that her wedding website division does not welcome same-sex couples. She does not want to engage with them, get to know their hearts, learn about their desires, hear their love story. She does not want the nuances of individuality to chip away at the certainty of dogma.

Smith expresses herself in her work. But is every single website an expression of her identity? Is she creating art? Or simply an artful commodity — professionally done, well-composed, pleasing to the eye. When she collaborates with a client on a website, exactly how much of it is really her speech? Is she a designer or something more akin to a dressmaker?

These are questions that nag the fashion industry and there’s no decisive answer. Over an entire professional career, a designer might create a handful of garments that rise to the level of art, which is to say frocks that open our eyes to a different kind of beauty, a new way of moving through the world, an inspiring lesson in inventiveness. But mostly, even the most talented designers are simply riffing on what we already know. They’re helping us to be our best selves and that alone is an extraordinary accomplishment.

Smith and her lawyers toss around the word “art” as if it’s common. As if it’s easy. But art is what people aspire to by opening themselves up, not shutting themselves off. Creators, if they are lucky, simply achieve a slightly better dress, film, song, story — or website — than what we already have. The truly remarkable ones communicate a message that helps us become slightly more informed, slightly more empathetic than we were the day before. Smith and her lawyers seem intent on making sure that in the not-so-distant future we’ll all be decidedly worse.

417,"Deputy fatally shot friend after ‘jokingly’ pointing gun, sheriff says","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Andrew Lawson and his roommate, Austin Walsh — both deputies with the sheriff’s office in Brevard County, Fla. — had spent Friday night at home playing “Call of Duty” when Lawson retreated to his bedroom after midnight and pulled out his Glock. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight When Walsh appeared in the doorway, Lawson pulled the trigger of what he thought was an empty gun, according to investigators.

He did so “jokingly,” Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey said in a news conference Sunday. Though nothing happened that first time, when Lawson pulled the trigger again, a bullet was released, hitting Walsh below his right eye and killing him, according to an arrest affidavit for Lawson.

“This unnecessary and totally avoidable incident not only took the life of an amazing young man and deputy, but it has also forever changed the life of another good young man who made an extremely poor and reckless decision,” Ivey told reporters.

On Sunday, Lawson, 22, was arrested and charged with manslaughter in what Ivey described as an “extremely dumb” accident and a “horrible, irresponsible decision.” The Florida Department of Law Enforcement and Palm Bay Police Department are investigating. Lawson has been “fully cooperative,” Ivey said.

Court documents did not list an attorney for Lawson, and he did not respond to a phone message from The Washington Post on Monday night. Authorities have not said whether the weapon that killed Walsh was issued by the sheriff’s office.

Walsh, 23, had worked with the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office since he was 18, first as a public safety officer and later becoming a deputy, which the sheriff said had been Walsh’s dream. He was also a member of the agency’s explorer program, an initiative that teaches young people about law enforcement.

Ivey described Walsh and Lawson as “the best of friends.”

On Friday night, the two had been hanging out at their home in Palm Bay after playing the video game “Call of Duty” with friends, officials said.

In his room, Lawson was holding his black 9mm semiautomatic pistol, a gun that fires one bullet with each trigger pull and is typically fed with a magazine, which he told police he thought was unloaded, according to the affidavit. He pointed the pistol at Walsh, pulling the trigger once, and when it did not go off, he repeated the motion a second time, the affidavit states.

A single shot was fired, fatally striking Walsh, according to the affidavit.

Lawson called 911 and was “distraught and devastated” when officers arrived, the sheriff said.

Lawson told Palm Bay police Sgt. Lewis Jones outside his home Saturday that he’d checked to see whether the pistol was loaded before pulling its trigger, the affidavit states. Lawson also told the sergeant that he “should have known” the weapon was loaded based on its weight, according to the affidavit.

Lawson is scheduled to make his next appearance in court Jan. 5.

Before his death, Walsh had been learning to fly planes so he could get his pilot’s license, a longtime dream of his, said Avery McDonald, a close friend.

The two struck up an online friendship when they were in high school, bonding over their interests in Star Wars, gaming and careers in law enforcement.

McDonald, now 24 and living in Alaska, had flown to Florida in August to celebrate Walsh’s 23rd birthday. Walsh introduced McDonald to his friends and persuaded him to move to Florida and apply for a job with the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office.

They’d planned a second trip for this month, McDonald said, and Walsh was supposed to pick him up from the airport on Saturday. McDonald will still take the trip at the end of the week and move to Florida later this month. But he’ll do it without Walsh.

“It’s going to hurt a lot,” McDonald said. “But he introduced me to a lot of good people.”

McDonald plans to wear a black memorial bracelet created in Walsh’s honor, “just so he’s always with me.”

Etched on the bracelet in white letters are the words: “Til Valhalla brother, may you live on forever.”

418,"San Francisco bars police from using killer robots, reversing recent vote","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to bar police from using robots to kill, in a striking reversal that comes just a week after it gave law enforcement that right in a limited number of situations. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight The board had received widespread criticism after voting Nov. 29 to approve a police proposal authorizing law enforcement to deploy remote-controlled, ground-based robots to use deadly force when there is “imminent” risk to life and alternative measures to subdue the threat do not work.

Officials on Tuesday also sent the issue back to a committee for additional review, leaving the policy open to future amendment.

District Supervisor Dean Preston (D), who had voted against the measure last week, called the reversal “crucial.”

“There have been more killings at the hands of police than any other year on record nationwide,” Preston said in a statement. “We should be working on ways to decrease the use of force by local law enforcement, not giving them new tools to kill people.”

“Common sense prevailed,” said Supervisor Hillary Ronen (D), who had also originally opposed the measure.

The San Francisco Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Tuesday. It had called last week’s vote a “testament to the confidence” of officials and residents in law enforcement.

Officials had been required to vote on the policy because of a recent state law that requires police departments to seek approval from local officials for the use of military-grade equipment, the Associated Press reported.

Militaries have long used unmanned devices to kill, but the debate over whether police can deploy killer robots first emerged in the United States after an incident in Dallas in 2016. After a lone gunman killed five officers in an extended standoff, police placed explosives on a robot and detonated the bomb to kill the shooter.

The board’s vote last week sparked furious debate and angry protests from rights groups who were concerned about the “militarization” of law enforcement, which they argue would disproportionately affect communities of color, who are more likely to be killed in police encounters than White Americans.

The proposal “is not a public safety solution, as the department claims, but an expansion of police power that history and common sense demonstrates will endanger lives needlessly,” reads a Dec. 5 letter from several Bay Area civil rights groups to Mayor London Breed (D) and the supervisors.

The pressure seemed to have worked on board members such as Gordon Mar (D), who publicly switched his position ahead of Tuesday’s vote. Mar said Tuesday that he had grown “increasingly uncomfortable” with the precedent the policy would set for other cities and had decided to vote against it.

San Francisco’s police department acquired robots between 2010 and 2017, which they said were primarily used during situations involving explosives or those requiring officers to keep distance while securing a site. They currently are not equipped to use lethal force.

The department said that only a small number of high-ranking officials were authorized to deploy robots that could use lethal force. Police Chief William Scott had said that it would be used only as a “last resort option.”

419,A bus driver helped a child read. Now he tutors kids for free between routes.,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

New Jersey school bus driver Herman Cruse noticed that a kindergartner seemed a little sad and out of sorts during one morning ride to Middle Township Elementary #1. “Bus drivers are the eyes and ears of students when they’re away from home,” said Cruse, 55, who drives students of all ages for Middle Township Public Schools in Cape May Court House, N.J.

“We have an uncanny gift to discern what kids are feeling,” he said.

When Cruse asked the kindergartner what was wrong, he said the boy explained that he wasn’t able to complete his reading assignment because his parents were busy with his four siblings at home.

It was hard to find one-on-one time to practice reading with his mom or dad, he told Cruse.

Cruse said an idea popped into his mind.

“I told him, ‘Listen, I have some free time, and if you don’t mind, I’d like to come to the school and read with you,’” he said.

Advertisement

Cruse received permission from the 6-year-old’s teacher, Alexandria Bakley, to show up at her kindergarten classroom the following week.

When he walked in, he said the boy shouted, “Hey, that’s my bus driver!”

“We went into a quiet corner and began reading together,” Cruse said. “It was a book called ‘I Like Lunch,’ about a boy who likes sandwiches, a boy who likes apples, a boy who likes cookies and a boy who likes milk. Put it all together and you have lunch.”

“So he read to me, I read to him and we read together, and from there, it took on a life of its own,” Cruse continued. “A second student wanted to read to me, then a third. All these kids were going to the teacher asking, ‘Can I read with Mr. Herman?’”

Almost two years later, Cruse now volunteers to help Bakley’s 18 kindergarten students and another kindergarten class with reading two days a week, and on a third day, he tutors the school’s first- and second-graders. After dropping the kids off at school, of course.

He and Bakley decided to call his reading circle “Mr. Herman’s Kids.”

“Herman is goofy, silly and super positive and the kids love him,” said Bakley, 27. “He’s a bright light at our school who makes every child feel loved and heard — they’re all drawn to his energy.”

Middle Township Elementary Principal Christian Paskalides said every child at the school looks up to Cruse, both on and off the school bus.

“He’s just a very personable guy, and it’s clear this is a passion for him,” he said.

“Positive adult interactions can sometimes dictate a child’s day, and a bus driver is the first and last adult interaction for most students other than family,” Paskalides added. “This is more than just a job to Herman — he’s a great role model and mentor.”

Cruse said he’s never wanted to be anything other than a bus driver.

When his second-grade teacher in Atlantic City asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, he was ready with an answer.

“Some of my classmates wanted to be a doctor, a fireman or a nurse, but without hesitation I said, ‘I want to drive buses,’” he said. “It’s a blessing that I get to do what I always dreamed about.”

Cruse has driven for several school districts since his first job in 1990, and he’s been with Middle Township Public Schools for the past nine years.

Because he lives in Egg Harbor City, N.J., about 40 miles away, it didn’t make sense for him to drive home after delivering students to high school, middle school and elementary school, he said, noting that as soon as he made himself comfortable, “it would be time to go pick them up.”

“Instead, I’d hang out at the gym, go the library or sit in my car and go to sleep to fill up the time,” Cruse said.

Advertisement

It wasn’t until he offered to help the kindergartner on his bus last year that he realized there was something more rewarding he could be doing, he said. Cruse had spent a lot of time reading to his own five children when they were growing up.

“They’d say, ‘Dad, how come you read so much?’ and I’d say, ‘Come on over and find out,’” he said. “I’d tell them, ‘The book is always better than the movie.’”

“There’s nothing better than time spent with a good book,” Cruse added. “When I was a kid, I loved to read the World Book encyclopedias. I’d also read road maps and road atlases. I guess they helped guide me into what I’m doing now for a living.”

When Bakley showed him the round table where children would read to him in her classroom, he pulled up a small chair and made himself at home, he said.

“It just felt right, and it’s a joy to see the kids get excited when they learn to sound out words,” Cruse said. “They feel a sense of pride. I love how reading opens up a new world for them. I feel lucky to see that firsthand.”

He spends about 20 minutes reading books with each child on a rotating basis, and he also challenges them to word games like alphabet bingo.

LaCotia Ruiz said her son Kingsly, 5, is more excited about books since he started reading with Cruse.

“Kingsly had a rough time with reading at the beginning of the school year, but he’s doing much better because of this fun one-on-one time,” Ruiz said.

“In the morning he wakes up excited and says, ‘I’m going to read with Mr. Herman!’” she said.

Cruse’s enthusiasm for his new role has caught on with his colleagues, he said.

“There’s now another bus driver who wants to help me out between his routes,” he said. “What started out as a way to kill time has now blossomed into a way to make a difference in the heart of a child.”

420,"Margaret Atwood, Stephen King rally around new author after no-shows at signing","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Debut author Chelsea Banning was filled with excitement ahead of her first book signing over the weekend in Ashtabula, Ohio, sharing exclamation-point-filled tweets and memes of a cheering SpongeBob. But she was quickly crestfallen when a crowd failed to materialize, despite 37 people who responded online that they would attend.

“Only 2 people came to my author signing, so I was pretty bummed about it,” she typed on Twitter. “Kind of upset, honestly, and a little embarrassed.”

The fantasy author didn’t feel down for too long, however, as superstar authors swiftly chimed in to share memories of their own book signings that had flopped — illustrating how it can be a long road to success and filling up rooms.

“Join the club,” wrote “The Handmaid’s Tale” author Margaret Atwood in response to Banning. “I did a signing to which Nobody came, except a guy who wanted to buy some Scotch tape and thought I was the help.”

Best-selling horror author Stephen King also replied: “At my first SALEM’S LOT signing, I had one customer. A fat kid who said, ‘Hey bud, do you know where there’s some Nazi books?’”

Korean American author Min Jin Lee, who wrote “Pachinko,” added that she had once attended a book reading where only “my husband’s cousin showed up.”

I did a book reading where only my husband’s cousin showed up. One person. I’ll never forget that reading. ✊ — Min Jin Lee (@minjinlee11) December 5, 2022

Neil Gaiman shared a memory of a signing in New York with fellow writer Terry Pratchett that “nobody came to at all. So you are two up on us,” he joked.

“One Day” author David Nicholls added his memories: “Ooh, boy, too many to share. The one where the bookshop staff kindly pretended to be customers so I wouldn’t feel too bad, that stays with me,” he tweeted.

“My Sister’s Keeper” author Jodi Picoult said she had “sat lonely at a signing table many times only to have someone approach…and ask me where the bathroom is.”

“We’ve all been there,” said British author Malorie Blackman, offering comfort. “I once did a talk at a library and five people turned up, including a mum who planted her two infant school children in front of me and then strategically ‘withdrew’ to get some peace for a while.”

Banning told The Washington Post that her reaction to the global literary support was “pure shock,” adding, “I’m still trying to process everything.”

“I love the writing community. It is so supportive,” she added.

Her debut novel, “Of Crowns and Legends,” the first of a trilogy, was published in August and is set in Camelot, following the fate of King Arthur’s children and the Knights of the Round Table amid a war. It has some fight scenes and “light gore,” she tweeted.

Banning began writing at age 15 and describes herself as a “writer, reader, performer, and lover of all things fantasy,” according to her official website. She works as a librarian in Ohio.

“I am working on book 2 and am hoping for a December 2023 release date! MAYBE sooner,” she told her flurry of new online fans, with more magic and new characters promised in her follow-up.

For now, another signing is in the works, she said, as people snapped up her book: “I am working out details!”

421,"Amy Robach, T.J. Holmes and the high-wire act of co-anchor chemistry","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes appeared to be in high spirits as they welcomed viewers back to ABC’s “GMA3” on the Monday after Thanksgiving. “T.J. is multitasking today,” explained Robach, as she sat between a laptop-wielding Holmes and their fellow co-host, Jennifer Ashton. As Holmes insisted that he was simply consulting the agenda for the show, Robach grinned. “Or maybe whatever World Cup game is on right now?” she teased.

Ashton tried to get in on the jokes, but Robach and Holmes were off and running, and the camera quickly settled on just the two of them.

“Why do I confide in you about anything if you’re going to tell?!” fussed Holmes, 45.

“Confide?!?” exclaimed Robach, 49, gesturing to his laptop. “Everyone can see!”

“Well, they don’t know what’s going on. Let’s not do this in front of people,” Holmes said, laughing, smoothly taking his anchor banter into a transition about how viewers might also be multitasking, shopping for those Cyber Monday deals.

TV news executives spend countless hours and millions of dollars trying to conjure this kind of on-air electricity — the witty banter and easy comfort between co-anchors that will persuade viewers to make a show part of their daily routine. But moments like these — and there have been many since Robach and Holmes started hosting “Good Morning America’s” afternoon spinoff together in 2020 — were cast in a new light by Wednesday after the Daily Mail published an in-depth investigation revealing that the relationship between the anchors, both married to other people, had turned romantic.

After a couple of fraught days, ABC News executives on Monday removed the two from the air at least temporarily, their future unclear. It was a move that felt both ironic and inevitable: It’s never hurt a show to have co-anchors who clearly adore each other, and falling in love on the job is hardly unprecedented. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski wed in 2018 after bicker-bantering for more than a decade on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

But a new romance can also inject volatility into the high-wire act of live TV and the family dynamic we’ve come to expect from the people who deliver us the news — especially on the morning and afternoon programs that “ooze wholesomeness,” said Evan Nierman, chief executive of global crisis PR firm Red Banyan.

Suddenly, Robach and Holmes are “in the conversation” in a way they never had been before, Nierman noted. “But it’s a pretty standard rule in journalism that you don’t want to become the story.”

When the Daily Mail approached ABC on Wednesday, Holmes at first denied to his bosses that he and Robach were involved, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an internal matter. That same morning, the tabloid published not only an account of the affair but 60 photos of the two looking cozy. One sequence captured the two of them packing their car after a trip to an isolated Upstate New York cabin, his hand fondly grazing her behind. The network has been on its back foot ever since.

The story ignited an internet storm. Holmes appeared on the show without Robach that day, and both deleted their Instagram accounts. Anonymous sources were quickly dispatched to the tabloids; some reported that the two had separated from their spouses over the summer.

Both anchors came up doing shoe-leather reporting in local TV markets — Holmes in his native Arkansas, Robach in Charleston, S.C., before moving to Washington’s WTTG (Ch. 5) — before moving into the softer, personality-driven realm of morning TV. Robach joined ABC in 2012, Holmes in 2014. Both are in their second marriages, to spouses they wed in 2010: Robach to former “Melrose Place” actor Andrew Shue, and Holmes to lawyer Marilee Fiebig. Neither Holmes nor Robach returned calls seeking comment.

Initially, ABC executives determined that the affair was a personal matter between consenting adults, according to one executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely. And on Thursday, Robach and Holmes were in front of the camera together again, joking about looking forward to the weekend, a vibe that turned positively giddy by the following day.

“You know, it’s too bad it’s Friday,” Holmes said to Robach with a jolly wryness, noting the “great week” he had enjoyed. “I just want this one to keep going and going and going, just enjoying it.”

“Speak for yourself,” Robach replied, with a laugh. The two then erupted in giggles during a wellness segment about how poppy seed bagels can trigger a positive result on a drug test.

Network executives, though, decided Saturday that a break was necessary as they plotted their next steps. A flurry of reports began to emerge in the New York Post alleging that Holmes had had other workplace romances and that colleagues had long been suspicious of his closeness with Robach. On Monday, ABC News President Kimberly Godwin told staff that while the relationship was not a violation of company policy, the pair “has become an internal and an external distraction.”

Advertisement

Even though the controversy involved a lower-profile spinoff of the more popular “Good Morning America,” the network response spoke to the deep investment audiences place in the lives of newscasters they see every day.

While the news has brought “GMA3” far more attention than it’s ever received before — ratings jumped by 12 percent over its average the day after the Daily Mail story broke, according to Nielsen — this is not the type of attention that broadcast executives relish.

If the pair is important to the network, “they’ll figure out a way to roll with [the relationship],” said Jonathan Klein, the former president of CNN, where he employed Holmes as an anchor from 2006 through 2011. “But if the romance turns out to be bad for the show, they could use this as an excuse to part ways with them.”

In an otherwise splintering media landscape, the TV news co-anchor dynamic remains a touchstone and a constant, particularly as morning shows have staked out some of the last claim to a mass appeal. If it weren’t for their morning shows, CBS News and ABC News would be losing money. (NBC News would still be profitable, aided mightily by its cable arm, MSNBC.)

Finding the elusive balance of cheerfulness, gravitas and chemistry between hosts is difficult, and it can play out publicly and messily — from NBC’s disastrous process of shunting Ann Curry off “Today” to replace her with Savannah Guthrie in 2012, to Kelly Ripa telling viewers how blindsided she was to learn at the last minute that co-host Michael Strahan would leave “Live!” to go to “Good Morning America” in 2016.

In the early days, TV news was generally delivered by one person sitting behind a desk, said Mendes J. Napoli, chief executive of Napoli Management Group, a division of Paradigm Media Entertainment. But executives eventually reasoned that it would be wise to spread authority between two journalists — if viewers didn’t warm to one, they might connect with the other.

Typically, those two journalists were men, even in the free-form realm of morning TV, where co-hosts in the early days included a chimpanzee — J. Fred Muggs, who helped Dave Garroway make “Today” a hit for NBC — and comedian Ernie Kovacs, who camped it up as a lisping “poet laureate” on Philadelphia’s WPTZ in 1950.

But after Barbara Walters joined “Today” in the 1960s, eventually becoming co-host, executives realized that “morning shows tend to have a significant female audience, and they want to invite a woman they can relate to” into their homes, said Mitchell Stephens, who taught journalism at New York University and wrote several books on the history of the news business.

“Viewers were drawn to the chemistry between the two anchors,” said Napoli, who represents hundreds of TV broadcasters. “I hate to use the word ‘family-like,’ but people really viewed them as family.”

When British stage director Simon Godwin was looking for a fresh way to stage a new production of Shakespeare’s “Much Ado About Nothing,” he realized he needed a plausible setting to make sense of the banter between Benedick and Beatrice — two romantic leads who spend most of the play verbally sparring while denying their obvious feelings for each other.

Advertisement

Where else can you find that kind of chemistry, fraught with public-private tension, on display? For his production that runs through Sunday at Washington’s Shakespeare Theatre Company, Godwin turned Benedick and Beatrice into broadcast news co-anchors.

“The adrenaline of presenting the news together is, I would say, a bonding experience. And you’re out there and presenting as a couple,” Godwin said. “For many people, the media is part of their family — and the stakes feel very high.”

The following is from “Elizabeth Taylor: The Grit & Glamour of an Icon,” by Kate Andersen Brower, HarperCollins, copyright 2022. Printed by permission. Elizabeth Taylor needed a date. It was the summer of 1976, and the 44-year-old movie star was freshly divorced for the second time from her great love, Richard Burton. But a new romance with Ardeshir Zahedi, the dashing Iranian ambassador to the United States, was frowned upon by his ex-father-in-law and boss, the shah of Iran. Which meant that when Queen Elizabeth II hosted a glittering Washington dinner party in honor of the U.S. bicentennial, the British ambassador had to scramble to find an alternate escort for the British-born Taylor. Sir Peter Ramsbotham picked up the phone and called one of Washington’s most eligible bachelors of the moment — John W. Warner, a former secretary of the Navy who harbored greater political ambitions.

“You know Elizabeth Taylor, don’t you?” Ramsbotham asked Warner.

“No! I don’t know Elizabeth Taylor,” Warner replied. He had seen her at cocktail parties once or twice, but always surrounded by other guests.

“Well, we need a suitable person to escort her to dinner.”

“Who are you thinking about?”

“You!” Ramsbotham replied, exasperated.

From Taylor’s perspective, her night with Warner at the British embassy went well. Warner, 49, and three years past his divorce from banking heiress Catherine Mellon, was a handsome Republican with silver hair, chiseled cheekbones and tailored suits. She called him the next day and asked what he was doing.

“I’m going to my farm and I’m not going to shave for a week,” he said.

“Hmm,” she said, “that sounds interesting.”

Warner was sitting in his library when he saw dust and gravel billowing from a limousine speeding up his driveway. He gave Taylor a tour while an assistant unloaded her many suitcases.

“This reminds me so much of England,” she told him as they walked arm in arm through the fields. “I’d like the role of the farmer’s wife.”

She did not want to be Elizabeth Taylor anymore. And she needed someone to help her get over Burton.

I’ll be dead when this is over, Warner thought to himself.

Five months later, he became the sixth of her seven husbands.

Zahedi would later speculate that they wed so quickly because Warner wanted her help in his 1978 bid for Virginia’s U.S. Senate seat. And Taylor did not question his motives. She knew that she would be an incredible asset. Voters clamored to meet her, enamored with how down-to-earth and approachable she seemed on her whirlwind tours of the state, making up to six stops a day for two months.

She shook so many hands that she hurt her own. “I saw it time and time again, the men would take a woman’s hand and just crush it, and say, ‘I’ve waited all these years to meet you.’ ” Warner recalled. “Her hand began to swell up.”

But she did not stop. She felt revitalized after the humiliation of another failed marriage to Burton.

Taylor understood the world of power and politics, but Warner did not make her feel like a true partner. And she was simply too dynamic a force to play a supporting role in the campaign. “I made a condition,” Warner said. “No jewelry, and she had to get rid of the Rolls-Royce and the yacht. She said, ‘The yacht? Aren’t you secretary of the Navy?’ I said, ‘Yes, but we’re going to have a busy enough life.’ ” She sold the Taylor-Burton diamond to help finance Warner’s campaign. It was a way of letting go of Burton and committing to a new man.

“I had to go along with the party line,” Taylor said later. A Republican women’s group told her not to wear purple, her favorite color, because “it denotes royalty … and passion,” one organizer told her.

“What’s the matter with that?” she replied.

“You’re the candidate’s wife!” The subject was closed.

In the large entrance of their grand Georgetown home, there was a spot at the top of the stairs where you could hear everything from below without being seen. One day, Taylor stood there with Mary Conover, one of Warner’s daughters, and overhead a political adviser talking to Warner.

“She has got to get her wardrobe together,” the adviser said. “She has to wear some tweed and plaid suits and proper hats.”

This preposterous guidance for the most glamorous woman in the world made Taylor and her stepdaughter laugh so hard they had to duck into a bedroom.

After Warner was elected, she got sweet revenge when she took her purple Halston pantsuit out of mothballs and wore it proudly to a luncheon thrown for her by the Republican ladies.

Taylor was notably more liberal than her husband. She supported the Equal Rights Amendment; he did not. She thought women should be drafted into military service. “That dog won’t hunt,” Warner told her. At a Republican congressional retreat, Taylor brought up the women-in-the-military issue. Silence fell over the crowd. When Warner motioned for her to be quiet, Taylor called back to him to drop his “all-domineering hand.” (Margaret Chase Smith, the first woman to serve in the House and the Senate, sent her a one-word commendation: “Bravo!”)

But she managed to have some legislative impact. Her impetus was a quintessentially Elizabeth moment on the campaign trail. On a side trip for lunch at the governor’s mansion in Richmond, the campaign bus was slowed by an early snowstorm. The timing was unfortunate: “I need to go to the bathroom,” she whispered to Warner, tugging at his sleeve. “Ask the driver to spot a restroom and pull over.”

Warner advised her that the bus had a bathroom. Taylor walked to the back but disappeared into the room for just a moment.

“Why don’t you go back and look at the bathroom?” she demanded. “It was a sodden mess! Pee everywhere.”

Warner beseeched the driver, who tried to make a pit stop at the Richmond airport, only to find it closed. Warner slipped the watchman a $20 bill, and Taylor disappeared inside the airport – but again came back out after only a minute.

“Which one of you fellows has a dime?” she asked. It was the era of the pay toilet, and no one had a dime. Finally, Warner had the governor’s driver meet the bus and race them to the mansion, sirens blaring; Taylor leaped from the car and almost knocked down the governor’s wife on her way in.

She brought it up later. “John, do you want to stay married to me?” she said. “Because if you do, you have five months to get rid of this law that penalizes women.” Warner approached Sen. Ted Kennedy, who partnered with him on legislation to outlaw pay toilets at airports.

After Warner won his Senate seat, he hosted a fundraiser breakfast at their Georgetown mansion for dozens of lobbyists, who paid $2,000 a seat. Just as they were leaving, the housekeeper announced that Taylor — who rarely made an appearance before midday — wanted to know if breakfast was still warm. She came down in an almost-transparent negligee and told the men as they put on their coats: “Do the right thing, do a favor for me — whatever you gave, now double it.” They did as they were told.

But Elizabeth was growing desperately unhappy in Washington. Warner was a workaholic who rarely missed a vote. With the campaign over, “I had no function anymore,” she said, “not even as an ornament.” Isolated from her Los Angeles social circle, she ate and drank at home alone, adding more than 40 pounds to her 5-foot-2 frame. Warner nicknamed her his “little heifer,” and she pretended not to be offended, but it stung.

She thought she had reached a new low when she forced herself to look in the full-length mirror of their Georgetown mansion one day, after stepping out of the bath. What she saw stunned her.

Before Warner was elected, a journalist asked if Taylor thought their marriage could withstand his life in the Senate. “I’ll tag along,” she said. But she soon learned that she could not go with her husband to Capitol Hill every day, and that when senators are not voting, they are often on the road campaigning for colleagues or working on their own reelection efforts back home. The separation was killing her.

“We worked so much at night, and she would sit around and watch the boob tube,” Warner admitted. He knew she drank “a bit too much” but maintained he never saw it as alcoholism.

“Pooters,” he would tell her, using another of his nicknames for her, “go pour yourself a Jack Daniel’s and go on upstairs and watch TV.” But her glasses of Jack Daniel’s were getting larger and larger.

Taylor’s descent into serious alcohol and painkiller addiction was terrifying for her family to watch. Chris Wilding, her second son, then in his early 20s, recalled a visit to Georgetown. “I would occasionally be awoken in the wee hours by the telephone intercom system in my bedroom. My mother would ask if I would like to meet her in the kitchen for a beer,” he said. “She would sound woozy — like a beer was the last thing she needed — but also genuinely lonely, and I could never turn her down.”

On one occasion, she called him to her bedroom, saying she needed help with something. What he saw alarmed him. “She was seated on the edge of the bed in her underwear, and she had a syringe of Demerol in her right hand. She pointed to a spot on her thigh and asked me if I would administer the shot for her. … I told her that I was sorry, but that I absolutely could not help her with this. She looked at me with deadened yet disappointed eyes.”

On Valentine’s Day, Taylor and Warner went out to dinner in Georgetown. He kept a pager in his pocket in case he was needed on Capitol Hill.

“Elizabeth,” he told her, “I’ve got to go vote.”

“You can’t! It’s Valentine’s Day. You’re going to leave me here?”

“I have no choice,” he replied.

He raced to the Hill, then came back to the restaurant, where she burst into tears and had to be taken home. When Sen. Howard Baker heard the story, he couldn’t believe that Warner would leave his movie-star wife alone on that night. Not long after, Baker asked Warner to make a speech for him at a conference. When Warner returned to the Senate, he was furious to learn that a vote had been taken while he was gone.

“I did a favor for your wife,” Baker said: He had broken Warner’s perfect voting record, so now, Baker hoped, Warner would no longer fear missing a single vote.

But Warner would never change. Life as a senator’s wife in Washington, Taylor said later, made her “a drunk and a junkie.” She worried that she would die of an overdose if she stayed.

In 1981, Taylor was deeply affected by the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. She decided to place a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for gun-control legislation. Warner was furious. “That was a sharp turn for the worse in their relationship,” said Austin Pendleton, who directed her that spring in “The Little Foxes” on Broadway.

Warner wrote Taylor a letter on April 1 of that year, begging her to reconsider.

“Memorandum for Elizabeth,” he began, then crossed it out and wrote “My loving wife.”

“We both share a strong belief that steps must be taken to remove the root causes for violence leading to these terrible assassination attempts. However we disagree on the means to affect our common goal. … Emotions are very high nationally and the impact of the ad would be minimal. … Should the ad have the reverse effect you desire, and prompt another act of violence somewhere, it would be tragic for all of us including the President and the recent victims, as well as our Nation.”

She placed the ad anyway.

Soon thereafter, they had the conversation.

“We decided one day that we were still friends, let’s stay friends and not let this pace drive us in the wrong direction,” Warner recalled. They finally divorced in 1982.

A few months later, Taylor’s children called Warner and said that their mother seemed sad: Could he fly to New York and surprise her for Christmas? They wrapped him in a giant red package in the middle of her living room.

“What is this???” she shrieked when she emerged from her room at noon. When Warner jumped out, she was giddy.

Twenty years later, reflecting back on her seven husbands, she remembered her time with Warner fondly.

“He knows he wasn’t the love of my life,” she told the New York Times in 2002. “And I know I wasn’t the love of his life, but we loved each other.”

423,"Dominique Lapierre, author of best-selling historical narratives, dies at 91","Listen Gift Article Share

Dominique Lapierre, a globe-trotting French author who used intimate stories of struggles and triumphs for best-selling historical narratives such as the 1944 liberation of France’s capital in “Is Paris Burning?” and a 1984 chemical leak disaster in India with “Five Past Midnight in Bhopal,” died Dec. 4 at age 91. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight His wife, Dominique Conchon-Lapierre, confirmed Mr. Lapierre’s death in an interview with the Var-Matin newspaper on the French Riviera. They had lived for decades in Ramatuelle, France, on the Mediterranean coast. No cause was given.

His books, mixing journalism and historical reconstructions, sold more than 50 million copies worldwide. They brought Mr. Lapierre particular acclaim in India for complex portrayals of slum life in “City of Joy” (1985) as well as his account of the Bhopal disaster, which was blamed for more than 15,000 deaths and left 500,000 people stricken with severe or chronic health problems.

Advertisement

He considered himself a historian with a flair for vivid journalistic storytelling. “Is history a piece of cold cake that no one can digest,” Mr. Lapierre told India Today, “or is history a reenactment of what actually happened with all the emotions, smells, colors, impressions of events?”

He had a precocious literary start, with the publication in 1950 of “Un Dollar les Mille Kilomètres” (“A Dollar for One Thousand Kilometers”), an account of traveling in the United States. After a stint in the French military, he landed a job at the magazine Paris Match, where he covered the Korean War and then was a special writer and editor based in Paris.

Mr. Lapierre’s work was infused heavily with a correspondent’s instincts for storytelling: richly reported personal stories and an eye for details — such as how author Ernest Hemingway set up shop in Paris after arriving with U.S. forces in 1944. Hemingway quickly took command of the bar at the “honeysuckle-covered” Hôtel du Grand Veneur, Mr. Lapierre wrote in “Is Paris Burning?” (1964) with co-author Larry Collins, in their account of the Nazi occupation of Paris and the Allied push into the city.

“In the bar, [Hemingway] had installed a case of hand grenades, a carbine, a bottle of the grateful owner’s best cognac and a prewar Michelin road map,” Mr. Lapierre and Collins wrote in the book, which was made into an all-star 1966 movie by French filmmaker René Clément.

But Mr. Lapierre often said he preferred on-the-scene reporting rather than looking back as a historian. In his 1991 book on the AIDS crisis, “Beyond Love,” Mr. Lapierre spent months with people afflicted by the disease and followed scientists and health teams.

For “Five Past Midnight in Bhopal,” written with Javier Moro and first published in French in 1997, Mr. Lapierre spent three years observing the lives of families living near the Union Carbide plant, where a December 1984 leak of a highly toxic gas used for pesticides, methyl isocyanate, became one of the world’s most deadly industrial disasters.

The book, released in English in 2001, doesn’t explore the chemical disaster until the last chapter. The stories from the shantytowns are already poignant in their desperation. “The result reads like a thriller, albeit one whose terrifying outcome is known from the outset,” journalist Birte Twisselmann wrote in an essay for the medical trade journal BMJ.

Mr. Lapierre’s topics ranged far, and included exploring South Africa’s history of apartheid in “A Rainbow in the Night” (2008) and the Israel-Palestinian conflict in “O Jerusalem!” (1971) with Collins as co-author. His professional and personal interests, however, were most closely bonded with India. “A love story,” he once called his connections to the country.

Mr. Lapierre and his wife funded humanitarian initiatives, including homes for people with leprosy and clinics in India’s West Bengal region and around Bhopal.

His 1975 book “Freedom at Midnight” (with Collins as co-author) revisited the 1947 partition of the subcontinent after British rule. Another major work came from nearly three years living for various stretches in Anand Nagar, or “the City of Joy,” a teeming slum in the heart of Kolkata (then widely known as Calcutta).

“The City of Joy” (1985) vividly chronicles the grinding poverty and never-ending hardships in a slum whose incongruous name was coined by jute makers seeking to attract workers. Yet Mr. Lapierre found inspiration, too, in the generosity amid the squalor, such as families taking in orphans or tending to those with tuberculosis, dysentery and other diseases.

The Washington Post’s then New Delhi-based correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller wrote at the time that Mr. Lapierre “sometimes over-romanticizes the struggle of the poor” and possibly took broad liberties in translated comments. “It is certainly unusual to hear someone who buys blood from the poor of Calcutta exclaim, ‘Holy mackerel!’” she wrote.

But Bumiller also gave Mr. Lapierre high marks for humanity and empathy.

“‘The City of Joy’ is full of basic truths,” she wrote. “Some of its moments may stay with a reader forever. Who can forget the dying rickshaw puller selling his bones to a man who makes money from exporting skeletons, or the poor of Calcutta washing the body of a friend, and weeping during the riverbank cremation ceremony?”

Mr. Lapierre pledged to help aid groups in Kolkata with half his royalties from the book, which was made into a 1992 movie starring Patrick Swayze. Mr. Lapierre said he carried a thumb-bell used by a rickshaw puller to remind him of the slum — but after several weeks sleeping on a dirt floor in the home of a Polish priest, he said he would check into a five-star hotel.

“Three days of bubble baths,” he told the Associated Press in 1985, “and a taste of scotch.”

New Orleans years

Dominique Lapierre was born July 30, 1931, in Châtelaillon-Plage, France, on the Bay of Biscay, into a family that kindled his lifelong interest in travel and writing. His mother was a journalist, and his father was a French diplomat who brought Mr. Lapierre to New Orleans as a teenager during a posting as consul general.

In Louisiana, Mr. Lapierre attended school and developed a love for cars and the open road. He later hitchhiked and traveled across the United States — adventures he incorporated into his first book when he was 19.

Mr. Lapierre graduated in 1952 from Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., and bought a 1937 Chrysler convertible for $30. He and his first wife, Aliette Spitzer, took a road-trip honeymoon, driving the car to Mexico and then Los Angeles, where they won $300 on a radio game show when they were almost out of money.

Mr. Lapierre sold the Chrysler, and they booked passage on a ship to Japan, and eventually worked their way across Asia and the Middle East. The travels were turned into his second book, “Honeymoon Around the World,” first published in French in 1953 and in English in 1957.

Mr. Lapierre was conscripted into the French army, serving as an interpreter with Allied forces in Belgium. There, he met Collins, an American corporal, who took a job with the United Press news agency in Paris after his discharge. Mr. Lapierre was with Paris Match. They decided to try their hand at something bigger — a book about the liberation of Paris.

Its commercial success led them to the next project, “O Jerusalem!,” about the birth of the state of Israel, which was adapted into a 2006 film. In 1980, they collaborated on a novel, “The Fifth Horseman,” about a Libyan terrorist plotting to detonate a hydrogen bomb in New York. (Collins died in 2005.)

Mr. Lapierre married Conchon-Lapierre in 1980. In addition to his wife, survivors include a daughter, Alexandra, from his first marriage. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.

Mr. Lapierre once said his curiosity was so expansive that he would need “10 incarnations” of life to fully explore the world.

“I like the idea that the world never stops,” he said, “that you are never bored.”

424,Loudoun fires superintendent after grand jury blasts schools’ handling of sex assaults,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

The Loudoun County Public Schools board has fired superintendent Scott Ziegler shortly after the release of a state grand jury report that blasted school leaders for their handling of two sexual assaults by the same student last year — and that called Ziegler a liar. Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight Loudoun schools’ spokesman confirmed early Wednesday in a text message that “Dr. Ziegler was fired last night.” The school board held a closed-session meeting Tuesday night, according to ABC7 News, which first reported the news. The former superintendent could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.

Ziegler and school officials have faced intense criticism for their response to the sexual assaults, which took place in May and October of last year. In particular, officials have been blasted for their decision to transfer the student assailant from one high school, where he assaulted a student in a girls’ bathroom, to another high school, where he assaulted another student in a classroom.

The grand jury report concluded that Ziegler was informed about the May assault on the day it happened, but that he later lied about his knowledge of the event during a June 22, 2021, board meeting. When asked by a board member that day whether Loudoun has records of “assaults in our bathrooms or in our locker rooms regularly,” Ziegler replied with a falsehood, the report states.

Ziegler said, “To my knowledge we don’t have any record of assaults occurring in our restrooms.” A witness told the grand jury this statement was a “baldfaced lie.”

Ziegler previously said that he misunderstood the question at the school board meeting. He said he believed the board member was asking whether the school had records of sexual assaults committed in bathrooms by transgender or gender-fluid students.

The grand jury concluded in its 91-page report that Loudoun administrators badly mismanaged the sexual assaults because of incompetence and a lack of interest in the events. But the grand jury also found there was no “coordinated coverup” of the assaults between Loudoun school officials and the school board, as some had alleged. Instead, the school board was mostly kept in the dark about the assaults, the grand jury found.

Ziegler had served as interim superintendent for about half a year before being named to the permanent position in June 2021. A former special-education and social studies teacher, he began working for the Loudoun school system in 2019, as assistant superintendent for human resources and talent development. He oversaw the district’s transition from online-only learning during the pandemic to four days a week of in-person instruction for about 40 percent of its 80,000 students, receiving praise for his leadership from Board Chair Brenda Sheridan (Sterling).

But Loudoun schools drew unfavorable attention from Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), who made the district a target during his campaign last year. He ordered the grand jury investigation during his first days in office and, this spring, attempted to force all nine members of the school board to seek reelection in November, which would have shortened the term of most of them.

Several Loudoun parents, education activists and county leaders across the political spectrum shared messages late Tuesday supporting Ziegler’s firing. Many had previously called for his removal along with that of other school leaders.

“I fully support the School Board’s decision to fire the Superintendent in light of the recent grand jury report. I hope this is the first in efforts across agencies to review and revise policies, including cross-agency communication,” Loudoun County Supervisor Juli Briskman tweeted Tuesday night.

Ian Prior, a Loudoun parent and founder of the conservative parents-rights group Fight for Schools, tweeted that Ziegler’s firing was not the end. “It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning,” he said.

And Loudoun4All, a left-leaning parent group that advocates for social justice and racial equity in the school system, released a statement praising Ziegler’s termination and calling for the termination as well of Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman, who was criticized in the grand jury report for failing to communicate well with the school system about the assaults.

“Loudoun4All believes that while the School Board firing Dr. Ziegler was an important step toward accountability for the failures revealed in the Grand Jury report, it cannot be the only step,” Loudoun4All wrote in the statement. “For his failure to take the initial charges of assault until he was forced to by the public outcry, for his failure to cooperate with LCPS, and for his refusal to provide the charges to LCPS, Loudoun4All feels that Sheriff Chapman also needs to resign.”

Chapman did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.

425,"Va. Rep. McEachin to be laid to rest; Pelosi, other dignitaries to honor him","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Members of Congress and other Virginia dignitaries are expected to pay respects to Rep. A. Donald McEachin at his funeral in Richmond on Wednesday morning, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight McEachin died last week at the age of 61 after a long battle with the secondary effects of colorectal cancer treatment, a death his family and staff described as sudden and unexpected. The funeral, which will be held at 11 a.m. at St. Paul’s Baptist Church, is not open to the press.

The Virginia Democrat had represented the 4th Congressional District, anchored in Richmond, since 2017 and had served in both the Virginia House of Delegates and the state Senate, amassing a quarter-century career in public service.

In Congress, his colleagues and friends have remembered McEachin for his fierce advocacy for environmental justice, seeking to confront and mitigate the uneven ways in which climate change or air and water pollutants have long disproportionately affected marginalized communities.

McEachin, the son of an Army officer and a schoolteacher, was born in West Germany in 1961. Before his career in politics, he graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law and became a trial lawyer, representing personal-injury clients. He later also became an ordained Baptist minister after receiving a master’s degree in divinity from Virginia Union University in 2008.

First elected to the House of Delegates in 1995, McEachin became the state’s first Black nominee of a major party for attorney general in 2001, with now-Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine on the ticket. But when he lost that race, McEachin stepped back from politics to reorient himself, preparing for a second act a few years later.

“He didn’t take the defeat and say, ‘I’m going to take my marbles and go away,’” Warner said in a speech on the Senate floor last week. “No, he said he still had public service in him.”

During his tenure in the state Senate, McEachin became an impassioned advocate for expanding Medicaid and health-care access — especially after he was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, challenging colleagues to place themselves in the shoes of someone staring down the same dire illness but without health insurance.

Though McEachin overcame cancer and rose to Congress, he developed a fistula as a complication of treatment in 2018, requiring two surgeries. McEachin had lost considerable weight amid his health challenges and in recent years had seemed to struggle physically, colleagues said.

The exact cause of death was unclear, though his staff pointed to his struggle with the secondary effects of the cancer treatment.

Last week, both chambers of Congress held a moment of silence for McEachin, as Virginia lawmakers in the House and Senate honored him in speeches. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) has not yet set a date for a special election to fill his seat.

426,Youngkin vows to reimburse shutdown violators who paid ‘unjust’ fines,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

RICHMOND — Gov. Glenn Youngkin vowed on Tuesday to reimburse businesses and individuals who paid “unjust” fines for violating state coronavirus restrictions, a move that comes as fellow Republicans have turned a shutdown-defying grilled cheese eatery into a cause celebre. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Youngkin issued an executive order directing various agencies, boards and commissions to report any fines, fees and suspensions imposed for violations of restrictions imposed under his predecessor, Democrat Ralph Northam.

Youngkin also announced that he will make two related proposals in the budget amendments he is scheduled to introduce Dec. 15. One would direct agencies to stop collection and enforcement actions. The other would have the state develop a process for reimbursing businesses and individuals “who paid unjust COVID-19 fines and fees.”

His office specified that the budget language will not apply to violations of health and safety rules for facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes.

“The fact that businesses are still dealing with COVID-19 related penalties and fines is infuriating. Livelihoods are on the line,” Youngkin said in a statement. “While we can’t undo the damage done during the Northam administration, we are taking action going forward to end COVID-era draconian overreach.”

Youngkin made the announcement four days after an arm of his administration — the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority (ABC) — executed a search warrant against Gourmeltz, a Spotsylvania County restaurant accused of selling liquor without a license.

Youngkin’s announcement did not specifically reference Gourmeltz, and Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter declined to say whether there was any connection between the restaurant and his action Tuesday. Porter said she had no information on how many businesses or individuals have been penalized for violating the pandemic restrictions.

Gourmeltz’s license was suspended for 90 days by a circuit court judge last month as an outgrowth of enforcement measures that started under Northam over the restaurant’s defiance of pandemic-related health restrictions.

Youngkin has faced criticism from some conservatives for ABC’s enforcement action against Gourmeltz, with some Republicans flocking to the restaurant as agents conducted their search.

“It’s time we unite and stand against the communist agenda,” state Sen. Amanda F. Chase (R-Chesterfield) tweeted in support of Gourmeltz owner Matt Strickland.

Calling the restrictions unconstitutional, Strickland is seeking to parlay his battle with the state into a seat in the Virginia Senate, running for the Republican nomination next year. “Through his fight against the tyrannical government, Matt realized a void in Virginia politics,” his campaign website says. “None of his elected officials stood beside him in his fight against Northam and the overreaching mandates; they were silent on the issue.”

Youngkin’s swipe at Northam drew pushback from the Democrat’s former spokeswoman, Alena Yarmosky.

“Governor Northam made Virginia one of the safest states in the nation during the height of COVID-19,” Yarmosky wrote in a text message to The Washington Post, adding that the state was among the top 10 in coronavirus vaccinations and twice won CNBC’s “Top State for Business” ranking during the pandemic. “I understand Governor Youngkin is just tuning back into Virginia, but he’s been in office an entire year. I’d recommend he focus on his own administration.”

The decision came late in the night at the end of a jam-packed agenda that saw the council take consequential votes to make Metrobus rides free in the District, overhaul the city’s troubled Department of Forensic Sciences and change how D.C. Public Schools is funded. All three measures will require a second vote and the mayor’s signature to become law.

The council is expected to hold just one more meeting in December before the end of its two-year legislative period; members must reintroduce any bills that are not passed this month in the next session, starting the process over.

The proposal to replace DCHA’s board came over vocal opposition from many public housing tenants, voucher recipients and their advocates, who agreed that the agency needs major changes — but said they should be undertaken only after debate and input from stakeholders and experts.

Lawmakers who support the measure have said it cannot wait, because the authority has less than four months left to correct deficiencies identified by federal officials. A U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development review issued Sept. 30 found that the authority failed to provide “decent, safe, and sanitary” housing for its residents, in violation of federal requirements.

The bill would bring from 13 to 9 the number of board members, all of whom would be appointed by the mayor and must include the city’s Office of Budget and Performance Management director, a resident of public housing, and someone with experience as a voucher holder. Its members are named in the legislation and slated to serve two years while the mayor and council work to create a permanent board.

Four current board members would be appointed, but not those outspoken about agency mismanagement — most notably Bill Slover, who complained to HUD about the agency’s governance just before the federal agency undertook its review. Many of the bill’s detractors see Bowser’s plan as an attempt to remove members critical of the agency’s performance.

Slover, a development consultant whose board seat was selected by the D.C. Consortium of Legal Services Providers, emailed a HUD regional director in October 2021 to raise concerns, records show. The email led to conversations with HUD officials, Slover said. Weeks later, HUD notified DCHA of the coming review. (HUD officials said in an email Tuesday that “several factors” contributed to their decision to conduct the review.)

Bowser publicly took aim at Slover, though not by name, saying at an October news conference that there are some “board members that have been there longer than anybody, that are appointed by advocacy groups and are accountable to no one.”

Bowser and Mendelson told reporters last week that board dysfunction was impeding the agency’s ability to move forward. “The current board is stopping a lot of things from happening,” Bowser said. “I think in the last couple of months, they haven’t even taken up much new business at all.”

Many advocates who criticize Bowser’s plan blame her previous appointees, who have made up a majority of the board, for the agency’s problems.

The mayor’s appointees voted as a bloc last year to hire DCHA’s director, Brenda Donald, without a national search. Many housing advocates questioned Donald’s lack of experience managing public housing or real estate. The recent HUD report recommended that Donald and the board receive training in critical housing authority functions, including procurement, HUD policies and financial management.

Donald served as director of the city’s Child and Family Services Agency under Bowser, who credits her with turning the agency around. The mayor told reporters last week that she recently urged Donald to stay on and help the agency “keep its commitments to HUD,” as Donald considered resigning amid criticism of her administration by the agency’s internal auditor.

Donald’s 2-year contract as director ends in September, and Mendelson said during a news conference Monday that he does not expect her to stay on beyond that. He said an overhauled board would “bring stability to the housing authority while it undertakes the process of finding a new executive director next year.”

The mayor said in a statement that DCHA needs a board “composed of experts who understand these [housing] issues deeply.” Asked whether she regretted not appointing such members before now, Bowser said, “No, I stand behind all of my board members.”

A separate bill to overhaul the city’s troubled forensics arm passed its first vote with unanimous support from the eleven council members still present around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday.

The legislation, introduced by D.C. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) with amendments from Mendelson, is the council’s attempt to rebuild the forensics department after it lost accreditation more than 18 months ago.

Advertisement

If passed, the bill would turn the department into an independent agency — making it harder for the mayor to fire the agency director and shifting oversight authority to an independent advisory board. It would also restructure procedures for handling complaints and errors, among other changes.

Bowser and D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis Ferebee opposed a bill from Mendelson on Tuesday aimed at changing the way D.C.’s traditional public schools are funded, with a letter to lawmakers cautioning that the bill “circumvents the normal education budgeting process” and moves the district away from “student/need based budgeting.”

The proposal passed unanimously; Gray was absent for the vote.

Public schools are funded based on several factors, including the number of students enrolled and concentration of poverty. Year to year, however, schools can lose money for reasons such as enrollment loss or personnel changes.

Mendelson said the measure will bring more stability to the city’s public school system by making sure campuses receive at least the same amount of money they did the previous year.

The council was divided Tuesday on a bill to expand the city’s medical marijuana program. The proposal would remove the cap on the number of medical dispensaries that can operate in the city and create a permanent version of emergency legislation from June that allows adults to self-certify their eligibility for medical marijuana.

The bill is an attempt to better regulate the legally ambiguous marijuana market that emerged in D.C. after voters in 2014 legalized possessing small amounts of marijuana, but Congress blocked the city government from creating a recreational marijuana market. Tuesday’s bill aims to help meet demand by increasing access to the city’s medical marijuana market.

Advertisement

The bill passed the first reading 9-4 with McDuffie, Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4), Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) and Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8) voting against the bill.

While the council largely agreed on expansion, members disagreed about how to address the city’s growing number of unregulated marijuana “gifting” stores, which operate through a legal loophole that allows shops to “gift” adults small amounts of marijuana with a purchase of another item, like a lighter or art.

Opposed by some gifting shop organizations and advocates, the proposal is the latest development in Mendelson’s so-far unsuccessful effort to drive business to the city’s licensed medical shops by cracking down on gifting shops.

The proposed bill includes what he called a “ramp up” period, which gives gifting shops the chance to apply for a medical license before the city begins enforcing fines and closures of unregulated shops.

McDuffie voiced concern about bill revisions that he said would “negatively impact social equity and public safety.”

The council worked late into the evening on a spate of proposals, including a bill to expand record sealing and expungement, which passed.

The crowd was sparse, save for a group with the D.C. chapter of the National Domestic Workers Alliance who wanted to witness the vote on a bill providing increased protections for domestic workers like housekeepers and personal assistants.

After nearly nine hours in the council chambers, they watched, with cellphones drawn to film the council’s remarks. The women hugged and cheered as the protections passed unanimously.

428,Fatality reported in apartment fire in Northeast Washington,"Gift Article Share

A person died in a two-alarm fire early Wednesday at a small apartment building in Northeast Washington, according to D.C. police. The fire was reported shortly before 4:30 a.m. in the 800 block of 20th Street NE, in the Carver-Langston neighborhood. More than 100 firefighters responded to the blaze in the rear of the two-story building near H Street.

Dustin Sternbeck, a spokesman for D.C. police, said the person who died is believed to be a man.

Vito Maggiolo, a spokesman for the D.C. fire department, said the building that burned was reported to be vacant. It was not immediately known what the person who died was doing inside the building. Police said they are seeking the person’s relatives before releasing an identity.

On the fire department’s Twitter page, officials said the fire extended to both floors and the attic and porches, and that it took about 30 minutes to bring it under control. Maggiolo said fire investigators are trying to learn what caused the fire.

430,"Scathing report urges major changes at FDA, including possibly breaking up agency","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

An outside group that was asked to examine problems at the Food and Drug Administration in the wake of an infant formula crisis this year offered a scathing indictment of the agency’s structure and culture and recommended major restructuring, including possibly breaking up the agency so that oversight of the food system gets more attention.

The FDA has long been accused of giving its food program short shrift, and it came under fire from members of Congress and others for not heading off a formula shortage that left many parents scrambling to feed their infants. The response to the formula crisis was hampered by flaws in the leadership structure and poor communication within an agency that seemed to be in a state of “constant turmoil,” according to the report from the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, which the agency asked to assess its operations.

The report recommends several options for fixing the agency, which is housed within the Department of Health and Human Services and is responsible for overseeing aspects of the nation’s food system, as well as tobacco products and pharmaceutical drugs.

The task force’s first, most sweeping suggestion was to create separate food and drug administrations within HHS, which would require approval from Congress. The task force acknowledged this was “thinking big” and would be a longer-term solution to remedying problems but said the benefit would be elevating the visibility of each side and separating their budgets.

Other, less ambitious options included separating the food and drug arms but keeping them within a single agency, as well as creating a new deputy commissioner position with authority for overseeing food.

In a statement, FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf said he will review the report and make decisions about the future of the agency with input from experts inside and outside the FDA.

The report comes in the wake of heavy criticism of the agency’s handling of a formula shortage earlier this year. Critics said the agency failed to act quickly enough on complaints about sanitation at a large Abbott Nutrition manufacturing facility in Michigan and then did not foresee the shortage triggered when the plant was shuttered to fix deficiencies identified by the FDA.

At least four babies fell ill from a bacterial infection after drinking powdered formula manufactured there. Two of the babies died. FDA investigators were not able to identify the source of the bacteria, and the company said it did not originate at the factory. But the company recalled 5 million units of powdered formula, and the five-month closure squeezed formula supplies. This left many parents without reliable sources of food for their babies and medically fragile children.

Legislators and food safety experts asserted that agency leadership has allowed long-standing structural flaws to fester.

Food safety experts have long complained that the agency’s food oversight arm has been chronically understaffed and underfunded. Those problems, critics say, have been exacerbated by poor communication between its centers. More broadly, experts say, the agency has prioritized the drug and medicine side, frequently drawing leaders with medical backgrounds and without food industry knowledge.

“This report exceeds expectations because it represents a formal acknowledgment of all the issues in the foods program that have taken place over many years,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. “That’s actually a very significant step.”

A bias toward the medical side, experts say, led to miscommunications and failures. A whistleblower report from a former employee alleging safety risks at the Abbott plant took four months to reach the top food safety official. The former employee subsequently dropped a federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration complaint, Abbott chief executive Robert Ford said in a call with investors this fall. Additionally, the coronavirus pandemic meant many food manufacturing facilities went without on-site inspections for most of a year.

In response to criticisms earlier this year in congressional hearings, Califf, a physician who was appointed to the top post in February, acknowledged that the response to the formula crisis took too long and that “some decisions in retrospect were not optimal.” Califf announced the review of the agency organization during a May hearing, and the Reagan-Udall review launched on Sept. 8.

Organizations representing consumers, the food industry and state food regulators are pushing to restructure the FDA. In April, the groups sent a letter to Califf, calling on him to unify the FDA food program under a deputy commissioner for foods, with accountability to the agency commissioner and direct authority over the agency’s food safety centers.

The Reagan-Udall task force suggested the agency establish a new structure with clear leaders and roles, that it develop a culture in which decision-making is rooted in scientific evidence and that it commit to better transparency, timeliness and predictability in decision-making.

“What’s clear is that the agency’s cultural and structural failures are contributing to communication, organizational and risk management failures that are making our food less safe,” said Scott Faber, a food safety expert with the Environmental Working Group. “Any of the structural reform options proposed by this task force would make the current system better, provided the Congress follows through on the needed resources.”

The Reagan-Udall Foundation is an independent nonprofit group created by Congress to help modernize industries and sectors covered by the FDA. It is funded by the FDA and large corporations that have business with the agency, including drugmakers Eli Lilly and Pfizer as well as Nestlé USA, which makes baby formula.

Lawmakers are scuffling over the Pentagon’s vaccine mandate in year-end negotiations

Conservatives have had marked success in challenging or delaying President Biden’s coronavirus vaccine mandates. Now, they’re pushing to halt such a requirement for the military — and they may notch a win.

The question of the day is whether Congress will end a coronavirus vaccine mandate imposed on military service members as part of a roughly $800 billion bill to reauthorize the Pentagon, known as the National Defense Authorization Act (or NDAA).

Top leaders huddled yesterday as they hash out an array of certain provisions of the legislation, though there are still unresolved issues. One person with knowledge of the NDAA, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the fluid legislation, said the bill as currently written directs the defense secretary to end the covid-19 vaccine mandate for activity duty and reserve component service members.

But that doesn’t appear final. The vaccine mandate is one of the items still under discussion, two congressional aides, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid, said last night.

The usual caveats with Congress apply here: There’s no deal until there’s legislative text, and such language hasn’t been released. Other policies up in the air include marijuana banking legislation and a bill from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that would overhaul the nation’s permitting process for energy projects.

No. 2 Senate R John Thune says NDAA talks at a standstill as Dems “try to exact huge ransom” over Rs push on Pentagon vaccine mandate — Heather Caygle (@heatherscope) December 5, 2022

The details

Late last week, over a dozen Senate Republicans warned they would drag out consideration of the defense policy bill if they didn’t secure a vote on ending the military’s vaccine mandate.

Since then, the issue has exploded onto the political stage. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) — who is looking to shore up enough votes to be speaker — claimed Sunday that he had worked out an arrangement directly with Biden to jettison the mandate, our colleague Tony Romm reported.

White House officials later disputed that characterization, saying instead that McCarthy had raised the issue with Biden, who had said he’d consider it. The adiministration pushed back against the idea of repealing the mandate, and said Biden opposes doing so.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s “been very clear that he opposes the repeal of the vaccine mandate and the president actually concurs with the secretary of defense,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said yesterday, adding that it remains “very much a health and readiness issue for the force.”

The arguments: The GOP asserts the policies have hurt recruitment and have forced several thousand to leave the military. Meanwhile, the Biden administration contends that the vaccine requirement was put in place to keep service members “safe and healthy,” and that the Pentagon has long mandated certain vaccines. If the policy is indeed ended, one question is what will happen to those who were discharged for refusing to get the vaccine.

Mandate checkup

The Biden administration announced a slew of vaccine mandates last year, projecting roughly two-thirds of all U.S. workers would need to be immunized or opt into weekly testing instead. The aggressive action came as the White House had struggled for months on how to jump-start the country’s vaccination campaign.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court greenlit a vaccine requirement for health-care workers in facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds. But several other major mandates have been axed or indefinitely delayed amid steadfast Republican opposition.

For instance: The nation’s highest court blocked the administration’s vaccinate-or-test policy for large employers, which would have applied to roughly 84 million people. In the wake of the decision, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration pulled the rule.

A nationwide injunction was recently lifted on the vaccine mandate for federal contractors, but the Office of Management and Budget told agencies not to enforce the requirement yet. The mandate for federal workers also largely isn’t being enforced.

“The legal landscape is very complicated and contested and not resolved,” said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. She added: “It really comes down to views about the role of government in people's life [and] health decisions.”

Virus watch

Flu hospitalizations soar as triple viral threat hangs over the holidays

Nearly every state in the nation is battling high levels of flu-like illness, public health authorities warned yesterday as multiple respiratory viruses threaten to overwhelm health-care systems this winter, our colleague Fenit Nirappil reports.

That ferocious return of influenza is coinciding with rising coronavirus hospitalizations and a surge in respiratory syncytial virus, although RSV is showing signs of leveling off in some parts of the country.

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said yesterday that the early and severe start to flu season grew significantly worse during Thanksgiving week. Hospitals admitted nearly 20,000 influenza patients, almost double the number from the previous week.

What they’re saying: CDC Director Rochelle Walensky urged Americans to get their updated coronavirus boosters and flu shots, as vaccination rates for both continue to lag. She said early data suggests this year’s flu shot formula appears well matched against strains currently circulating around the country, and that the shots can help to drive down hospitalizations even when they don’t stop infections.

Social Security offices critical to disability benefits hit breaking point

State offices tasked with deciding who should receive federal disability benefits on behalf of the Social Security Administration are struggling to process a massive backlog of claims, which mounted to new heights during the coronavirus pandemic, our colleague Lisa Rein reports.

Why it matters: The pileup of cases has left more than a million Americans with fewer resources, worsening medical conditions and no access to the health insurance that comes with disability benefits as they wait in limbo to hear whether they’ll receive assistance — the first step in a system of drawn-out judgments and appeals that can take years before a resolution.

Advertisement

Data obtained by The Post paints a grim picture of the holdups claimants are confronting across the country, the worst of which is in Delaware, where the average wait to process an initial application was 261 days.

Behind the delays lie years of financial neglect and mismanagement in a system in which flaws were amplified by the public health crisis. Perennial hiring and pay struggles, staff shortages, obsolete technology, and fault lines between the states and federal officials have all played into this dynamic, Lisa writes.

Social Security officials said they are working to break the logjam by collaborating with states to approve money for vacant jobs; improving hiring strategies, retention and training; and paying overtime. The agency also is sending reinforcements to struggling states to help process claims.

Medical malpractice lawsuits, delayed by the pandemic, mount against hospitals

Health systems are grappling with higher-than-usual medical malpractice expenses from prior claims now that courts and jury trials return to normal operations, Stat reports.

The payouts are a lifeline for patients and families harmed by medical errors, though they’ve added financial strain on hospitals contending with ballooning labor and supply costs.

The details: Typically, health systems plan ahead for any legal costs they might incur and build that into their insurance reserves, but some hospitals are seeing malpractice costs rise to levels they hadn’t expected.

For instance: Major not-for-profit health systems like Baylor Scott & White Health, CommonSpirit Health and Mass General Brigham all reported larger self-insurance reserves or professional and general liability funds, which include malpractice, in their latest financial statements.

And while many delayed cases were filed before the pandemic, experts say there’s reason to believe more will result from the staff shortages and reassignments that took place during the pandemic, Stat’s Tara Bannow writes.

Nearly every U.S. state is battling high levels of flu-like illness, public health authorities warned Monday as multiple respiratory viruses threaten to overwhelm the health-care system while people travel for the holidays and gather indoors with friends and family. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials say they’re seeing signs of an early and severe flu season that turned significantly worse during Thanksgiving week, the official start of the holiday season.

That ferocious return of influenza is coinciding with the start of a third pandemic winter — with a novel coronavirus that never left.

“It’s a perfect storm for a terrible holiday season,” said the chair of the American Medical Association board, Sandra Fryhofer, an Atlanta infectious-diseases physician who joined a Monday briefing by the CDC.

Levels of flu-like illness, a measure of medical visits with respiratory symptoms that could also be caused by RSV or covid-19, were high or very high in 47 jurisdictions during Thanksgiving week, up from 36 the previous week, said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. Hospitals admitted nearly 20,000 influenza patients, almost double the number from the previous week. Officials also reported two new pediatric flu fatalities, bringing this season’s death toll in children to 14.

In all, the CDC has recorded at least 8.7 million illnesses, 78,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths from flu since October.

Meanwhile, coronavirus hospitalizations are also rising, while cases of respiratory syncytial virus, commonly known as RSV, remain high, although they appear to have peaked in some regions.

“The past several years have certainly not been easy, and now we face another surge of illness, another moment of overstretched capacity, and one of tragic and often preventable sadness,” Walensky said at the briefing.

Walensky urged Americans to get their flu shots and updated coronavirus vaccine boosters, which are tailored to omicron subvariants. She said that early data suggests this year’s flu shot formula appears to be well matched against the circulating strains, and that shots drive down hospitalizations even when they do not stop infections.

Public health authorities have been worried about flu vaccination rates that have been lower than in previous years, including in groups at high risk of hospitalization, including young children, pregnant people, and adults 65 and older.

“We all have booster fatigue, but understand you could get really, really sick this year and ruin your holiday celebrations if you don’t get vaccinated,” Fryhofer added of the new coronavirus booster shots.

Officials also offered some good news about RSV, which has no authorized vaccine yet.

Surges of that virus appear to have peaked in the South and Southeast and may be leveling off in the Mid-Atlantic, New England and the Midwest, Walensky said.

Advertisement

“While this is encouraging, respiratory viruses continue to spread at high levels nationwide, and even in areas where RSV may be decreasing, our hospital systems continue to be stretched with high numbers of patients with other respiratory illnesses,” she added.

Walensky urged those with symptoms of flu or covid to see doctors early to get prescription antivirals that greatly reduce the likelihood of severe illness if taken within the first days of illness.

Health officials have also prioritized administering flu and coronavirus vaccines to reduce the strain on hospitals, at a time when no major jurisdiction has imposed a mask mandate to limit transmission.

On Monday, Walensky said that the CDC recommends masking on public transportation and that “we also encourage you to wear a high quality, well-fitting mask to help prevent the spread of respiratory illness, especially for the 5 percent of the population currently living in counties with high covid-19 community levels.”

Advertisement

The CDC is not a regulatory agency, so it can recommend masking but not mandate it.

The agency adopted a new system early this year to link masking recommendations to a formula that emphasized the strain on hospitals rather than just the number of infections. That formula is being tested as hospitals fill up with people infected by other respiratory viruses, meaning new coronavirus infections can threaten hospital capacity even at lower volumes.

Walensky said the CDC was re-examining its metrics but noted that Americans who are concerned about the triple viral threat can act to protect themselves immediately.

“One need not wait for CDC action in order to put a mask on,” she said.

433,"Ancient human relative used fire, surprising discoveries suggest","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Explorers wriggling through cramped, pitch-black caves in South Africa claim to have discovered evidence that a human relative with a brain only one-third the size of ours used fire for light and cooking a few hundred thousand years ago. The unpublished findings — which add new wrinkles to the story of human evolution — have been met with both excitement and skepticism.

South African paleoanthropologist and National Geographic explorer Lee Berger described finding soot-covered walls, fragments of charcoal, burned antelope bones and rocks arranged as hearths in the Rising Star cave system, where nine years earlier the team uncovered the bones of a new member of the human family, Homo naledi.

Control of fire is considered a crucial milestone in human evolution, providing light to navigate dark places, enabling activity at night and leading to the cooking of food, and a subsequent increase in body mass. When exactly the breakthrough occurred, however, has been one of the most contested questions in all of paleoanthropology.

Advertisement

“We are probably looking at the culture of another species,” said Berger, who dispensed with scientific convention by reporting the discoveries not in a peer-reviewed journal but in a press release and a Carnegie Science lecture at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington on Thursday. In an interview with The Washington Post, Berger, a professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said formal papers are under review and added, “There are a series of major discoveries coming out over the next month.”

He stressed that his team’s discoveries this summer answer a critical question raised when it announced the initial trove of 1,500 fossil bones: How did this ancient species find its way into a cave system about 100 to 130 feet below ground, a place that is devilishly hard to reach and, in his words, “horrifically dangerous”?

The research team now believes that H. naledi used small fires in chambers throughout the cave system to light their way. Berger based the claim in part on his personal journey through the cave’s narrow passages, which required him to shed 55 pounds.

Moreover, he argued that use of fire by a human relative with a brain little bigger than a large orange upsets the traditional story of our development. For years, experts portrayed evolution as “a ladder” that moved ever-upward toward species with larger brains and greater intelligence, while leaving smaller-brained species to perish.

But evidence has been building that the process may have been messier than thought, a view that would be bolstered if indeed this smaller-brained contemporary of early Homo sapiens was advanced enough to use fire.

Berger’s lecture, accompanied by photographs from the cave but not by carbon dating and other traditional scientific methods, drew criticism, as have some of his previous assertions about the H. naledi fossils.

“There’s a long history of claims about the use of fire in South African caves,” said Tim D. White, director of the Human Evolution Research Center at the University of California at Berkeley, who is a past critic of Berger’s. “Any claim about the presence of controlled fire is going to be received rather skeptically if it comes via press release as opposed to data.”

Past reports of humankind’s early use of fire, even those accompanied by scientific evidence, have proved contentious. In 2012, archaeologists using advanced technology reported “unambiguous evidence in the form of burned bone and ashed plant remains that burning events took place in Wonderwerk Cave” in South Africa roughly 1 million years ago. Critics questioned that age estimate, and scientists revised the date to at least 900,000 years old after using a complex technique called cosmogenic nuclide dating.

White said rigorous studies must date both the evidence of fire and the H. naledi bones if Berger’s team is to demonstrate that both come from the same period. Other studies must show not just the presence of fire, but its controlled use. Testing would need to establish that the material believed to be soot actually is soot and not discoloration caused by chemicals or other factors.

Berger acknowledged that one of the major challenges facing him and his colleagues will be dating the materials they have found. So far, they have said the H. naledi bones date to between 230,000 and 330,000 years ago, though Berger stressed that those dates should not be viewed as the first or last appearances of the species.

White appeared most skeptical about the lack of stone tools found in the caves. He said archaeologists would expect to find thousands of stone tools in a place where human relatives were using fire for light and cooking.

“I will tell you at this stage there are no stone tools that we’ve found in the presence of a hearth,” Berger said in the interview. “That is an odd thing.” Nonetheless, he told the audience at the Carnegie Science lecture, “Fires don’t spontaneously start 250 meters into a wet cave, and animals don’t just wander into the fires and get burned.”

He said stone tools have been found in the general landscape outside the caves. He also pushed back against criticism that what the team has found does not constitute proof of an ancient hearth.

“We found dozens of hearths, not just one,” Berger said when asked about the evidence during the interview. “It’s 100 percent. There’s no doubt. … We’re now entering a phase where this goes from just bones to a rich understanding of the environment they lived in.”

Berger previously ran into controversy during the initial announcement of the discovery of H. naledi, when he suggested that these ancient relatives were deliberately using the caves as a place to lay their dead. Despite the debate, Berger repeated the claim at several points during the lecture, acknowledging that it was “perhaps not very well received by most of the academy.”

Other researchers said that even though much testing remains to be done, the latest finds at Rising Star are impressive.

“I think it’s terrific. It looks very convincing,” said Richard W. Wrangham, a professor of biological anthropology at Harvard University and author of the 2009 book “Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human.”

“Of course it’s fascinating because of the small and generally mysterious nature of these people.”

Wrangham said that when the discovery of H. naledi was announced, he was discussing the dark caves where the bones were found with one of Berger’s colleagues and remarked, “Surely this must mean that they had light.”

However, Wrangham said he remained puzzled on one matter: “How did they put up with the smoke? Was there a draft that pulled smoke out of the cave?”

Wrangham said he is willing to take Berger at his word about the use of fire, based on the early evidence. He said the strongest evidence for early control of fire, however, comes from an archaeological site in Israel called Gesher Benot Ya’aqov, where experts say early human relatives used fire to cook fish about 780,000 years ago.

During the lecture, Berger also shared vivid descriptions of some of the 50 H. naledi individuals the team has found.

He described the fossil bones of a hand “curled into a death grip”; the skull of a child found sitting atop a shelf in the rock; and the skeleton of another child tucked into an alcove in one of the chambers. The dramatic images required an equally dramatic journey through a slit in the dolomite that narrows to just seven inches and requires extreme contortion of an explorer’s body.

“You’re basically kissing the ground,” said Keneiloe Molopyane, a 35-year-old researcher at the South African university’s Center for the Exploration of the Deep Human Journey. Explorers, she continued, emerge onto a perilous ridge about 65 feet above the cave floor. Inside, it’s pitch black, with “bats whizzing by you on either side. If you fall, you belong to the cave.”

The reward, however, is a feeling Molopyane vividly recalled from her first descent into the cave system: “Oh, God. I am the first person to see these remains in I don’t know how many thousands of years, and now I am touching them.”

Berger said roughly 150 scientists around the world are taking part in the effort to excavate, date and study the remains and artifacts found at the Rising Star cave system.

Asked to speculate on the interactions and possible conflicts that may have taken place between H. naledi and H. sapiens, Berger replied, “Everything you just asked, within the next 36 months, we will have answers.”

434,"‘Shark Week’ lacks diversity, overrepresents men named Mike, scientists say","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Lisa Whitenack loved sharks as a kid. She spent rainy days leafing through a guide to sharks in Reader’s Digest. Every summer, she would watch “Shark Week,” Discovery’s annual TV event that spotlights the ocean predator with seven days of dedicated programming. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But when the scientists appeared on her TV screen, she rarely saw any women she could look up to.

“Why would I know I could do that?” Whitenack said. “I don’t come from a family of scientists. I didn’t see very many people that looked like me on television.”

Whitenack, now a biology professor at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., found her way into shark research anyway. When the pandemic lockdowns came in 2020, she saw an opportunity to study the source of her old misconceptions. Was “Shark Week” feeding audiences the wrong messages about sharks — and who studies them?

Advertisement

Whitenack led a team of researchers to examine hundreds of “Shark Week” episodes that aired between 1988 and 2020. In a study published last month by the Public Library of Science, their research claims that Discovery’s programming emphasized negative messages about sharks, lacked useful messaging about shark conservation and overwhelmingly featured White men as experts — including several with the same name.

The programming featured more White experts and commentators named “Mike” than women, said David Shiffman, a conservationist at Arizona State University who was a co-author of the study.

“When there are hundreds of people of color interested who work in this field, [and] when my field is more than half women, maybe it’s not an accident anymore that they’re only featuring White men,” Shiffman said.

Discovery did not respond to a request for comment on the study’s findings. The company told NBC Boston that it wouldn’t comment on a study “that has yet to pass any scientific approvals” after a preliminary version was presented 2021. It has since undergone a scientific review, Whitenack said.

“Shark Week,” a 34-year tradition and consistent ratings draw for Discovery, has faced criticism in the past. Scientists and TV critics blasted the event in 2020 for announcing a roster of TV specials that featured six White men out of eight named experts.

Whitenack’s study found that the trend persisted throughout almost all of the television event’s history. Over 90 percent of the 229 experts featured in 201 “Shark Week” episodes were White, the study found, and about 78 percent were men.

Carlee Bohannon, a marine biologist and co-founder of Minorities in Shark Sciences, praised the study for putting numbers to her and her colleagues’ long-standing concerns about diversity in both the media and shark science. When Bohannon founded her organization with three other Black scientists in 2020, it was the first time any of them had met other Black women in their field.

“We all grew up seeing one type of person on TV,” Bohannon said. “‘Shark Week’ was really the biggest thing, and it was always filled with White men.”

According to a separate diversity study co-written by Shiffman, more than half of the members of the American Elasmobranch Society, an academic group supporting the study of sharks and other fish, are women, but over 70 percent of the group’s leadership positions have been held by men. Women in marine sciences can also face a misogynistic culture, marine biologist Catherine Macdonald wrote in Scientific American in 2020.

“‘Shark Week’ further concentrates power (in the form of publicity and media attention) in the hands of white male ‘featured scientists,’ exacerbating academic power imbalances,” Macdonald wrote.

In the latest study, Whitenack and the other researchers also found that more “Shark Week” episodes included stories of attacks and other fearmongering messaging than positive language describing sharks as “awe-inspiring” or ecologically important, which the study called a missed opportunity.

“Shark Week” also lacked effective messaging about conservation issues, researchers said. Though Discovery has used the show to promote legislation protecting sharks, “Shark Week” rarely gave viewers actionable information about conservation issues, such as avoiding seafoods caught in ways that also trap and harm sharks, the study claims.

But Whitenack and Bohannon agreed that the biggest concern was with the program’s lack of diversity and how that might shape young scientists’ perceptions of marine biology and whether they could enter the field.

“Diversity in people brings diversity in thought, which ultimately brings innovation,” Bohannon said. “Being able to see someone who looks like you in this field really has an impact.”

Whitenack said Discovery hasn’t contacted the research group.

In 2020, National Geographic developed a partnership with Minorities in Shark Sciences that allowed members of the organization to participate in the network’s competing TV program, “SharkFest,” Bohannon said. Seven scientists of color from the group appeared in this year’s programming.

Bohannon appeared on “SharkFest” twice to talk about nurse sharks in the Bahamas and how they have adapted to swim in shallow water. It felt like a milestone — one she wishes more of her peers get to experience.

“Just seeing myself on TV,” Bohannon said, “it was very surreal.”

435,Why this mammal eats its own brain — and why it could matter for you,"Animalia Why this mammal eats its own brain — and why it could matter for you Unlocking the shrew’s secret to shrinking its own cognitive tissue in winter – only to regrow it in spring – may help doctors treat neurodegenerative diseases in humans (Video: Washington Post illustration; iStock)

Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

This article is part of Animalia, a column exploring the strange and fascinating world of animals and the ways in which we appreciate, imperil and depend on them. The shrew scampered across the sand, zipping its tiny, velvety body right, left, right, left. In just a few seconds it found the prize concealed in the sandbox: a tasty mixture of earthworms, mealworms and other meat.

To quickly solve the puzzle in Dina Dechmann’s lab, the shrew didn’t just need to learn where its meal was hidden. Something else astounding happened in its head. It had to regrow its own brain.

“It’s a crazy animal,” said Dechmann, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. “We can learn a lot from the shrews.”

To prepare for the depths of winter when food is scarce, many animals slow down, sleep through the cold or migrate to warmer locales.

Not the common shrew. To survive the colder months, the animal eats away at its own brain, reducing the organ by as much as a fourth, only to regrow much of brain matter in the spring.

The process of shrinking and expanding the brain and other organs with seasons — dubbed Dehnel’s phenomenon — allows animals to reduce calorie-consuming tissue when temperatures drop. Researchers have discovered seasonal shrinkage in the skulls of other small, high-metabolism mammals, including weasels and, most recently, moles.

The shrew’s incredible shrinking brain is more than just a biological curiosity. Understanding how these animals are able to restore their brain power may help doctors treat Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases in humans.

“In the beginning, I couldn’t quite grasp it,” said John Dirk Nieland, an associate professor of health science and technology who is now researching drugs designed to mimic shrews’ brain-altering chemistry in humans.

“It’s really amazing the way they react and the way they respond,” he added.

A shrew that can’t be tamed

For decades, few scientists grasped the implications of August Dehnel’s 1949 discovery.

Born in Warsaw, Dehnel spent his early career studying bird eggs before the Nazi invasion of Poland interrupted his work on Europe’s beavers and other mammals.

The young zoologist served in the Polish army, though he remained devoted to his academic work during the war. Captured by the Germans, he gave biology lectures at a prisoner-of-war camp.

Back in the lab after the war, he noticed the skulls of shrews collected from the Białowieza Forest at the border of Poland and Belarus contracted and expanded with the seasons.

The high-metabolism mammal pursues insects, spiders, slugs and worms seemingly nonstop to survive. Ranging from the Scottish highlands to the Siberian tundra, it squeaks at pitches beyond human hearing, listening for reverberations to navigate underground.

Unlike deer or bears, shrews are too tiny to migrate and too hyper to hibernate when winter arrives. They live fast and die young, with an average life span of a little more than a year. “Their metabolism isn’t set up for slowing down like that,” Dechmann said.

That makes the jittery creatures awfully challenging to study in captivity.

The common shrew is one of the few mammals with a venomous bite, and it emits a nasty odor potentially to deter cats and other predators. To acclimate the shrews to the seasons, the team keeps its cages outdoors.

Dehnel himself struggled to cage and breed shrews, though he ultimately succeeded. And their metabolism is so high that Dechmann and her colleagues find it difficult to sedate them for scans.

“We cannot get them to sleep,” she said. “It seems almost like a knockout state is not built in because they can’t afford to become unconscious because they’ll simply starve.”

“They’re little bastards,” she added.

Bigger isn’t always better

Shrews’ unorthodox strategy of reducing their brain power may help them save on energy during the winter, but it comes at a cost.

In a series of experiments involving finding food in a sandbox, larger-brained shrews in the summer outperformed their smaller-brained counterparts in the winter, Dechmann’s team found.

“It’s a compromise,” she said. “You make your brain smaller, you save energy, but you become — I don’t want to say stupid, but you become less good at solving certain learning tasks.”

But it’s what happens next that’s remarkable: In the spring, their brains grow back, and their ability to solve lab puzzles appears to return, too. The team is now testing the shrew’s ability to navigate a labyrinth made of LEGO pieces.

“The beauty of the shrew is that, yes, they shrink the brain, but what we see also is that in the spring, they can start growing the brain,” said Nieland, who also co-founded a biotech company named 2N Pharma.

The notion that, for some animals, a smaller brain is a better one is a difficult idea for many people to accept, Dechmann said. She and colleagues received hate mail after publishing a study showing some bats evolved smaller brains to fly faster. Their paper was titled “Bigger is not always better.”

“People at the time did not want to believe that the brain would get smaller,” she said. “We have a large brain and that means we’re more intelligent.”

Figuring out how exactly shrews pull this off is the next step. Dechmann and Nieland — together with Liliana M. Dávalos, an evolutionary biologist at Stony Brook University in New York — received a grant from the French nonprofit Human Frontier Science Program to fund their shrew research.

For one, the shrew’s brain doesn’t regrow uniformly. The hippocampus expands back to normal, for instance, while the neocortex does not. Both of those parts of the brain help with memory.

And it’s the lipid-rich white matter strewn throughout the brain that appears to be disappearing, suggesting the tiny mammal’s body may be consuming portions of its own brain to make it through the winter.

The deterioration of white matter, which helps relay information in the brain, is a symptom of multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative illnesses.

Researchers are now searching for the proteins or other triggers responsible for the shrinkage and regrowth in the shrews’ noggins. “We are far from applied results,” Dechmann cautioned, though Nieland’s company is working on one drug right now.

If those chemicals are found, Nieland said, “we could maybe use these pathways also to treat brain diseases.”

For Dávalos, finding such an amazing ability in an animal right under European gardeners’ noses is remarkable in and of itself. The discovery suggests there is so much more to find in rainforests in the Amazon, Congo and elsewhere.

“How many centuries have people been studying the European fauna?” she said. “And how many thousands and thousands of scientists have been looking and they hadn’t seen this?”

“Think about all the amazing things that are out there hidden because we have never looked.”

436,A giant move for Aaron Judge all but sets MLB’s winter meetings ablaze,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

SAN DIEGO — Around 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, just as San Francisco Giants Manager Gabe Kapler finished his winter meetings session with reporters, word started to spread through the lobby of the Manchester Grand Hyatt that the star of this year’s free agent market had made up his mind. It started with a tweet, quickly retracted, that suggested Aaron Judge was bringing the New York Yankees’ worst-case scenario to bear by signing with the Giants.

It persisted despite repeated assurances from Giants CEO Larry Baer, cornered in the hotel driveway, that he had “nothing to report,” despite Kapler insisting he hadn’t heard anything — though he admitted, somewhat coyly, that he had been talking to reporters, not looking at his phone. By the time the sun set on a cloudy day here, nothing was official.

Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said he had just gotten out of the shower when the rumor reached him. He called General Manager Brian Cashman, who told him nothing had changed as far as he knew. A few minutes later, it was his turn to meet with reporters, whom he greeted with a smile and a joke about the fortuitous timing.

“It’s been an uncomfortable hour,” he admitted.

Elsewhere, it was a frantic one. Reporters in the lobby checked for chartered flights from Tampa, where Judge had greeted Tom Brady at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ game Monday night, to San Diego. They found one, landing in the late afternoon. The day’s baseball news — including first baseman Josh Bell agreeing to a two-year deal with the Cleveland Guardians and left-hander Andrew Heaney agreeing to sign with the Texas Rangers for two years, according to people familiar with the deals — seemed quaint by comparison.

Judge had been the focus of the baseball world almost all season, from the moment he turned down New York’s extension offer in April through his 62-home run summer to the night the Yankees’ season ended when the soon-to-be World Series champion Houston Astros swept them in the American League Championship Series.

For the Yankees, Judge was the foundation on which to build this offseason, not a prize to be won. He was the AL MVP, and rightfully so: No player in baseball had as much on-field influence over his team’s fate than Judge, who sometimes single-handedly propped up New York’s lineup down the stretch. He would be the Giants’ biggest star since Buster Posey — maybe since Barry Bonds.

So the day in San Diego belonged to Judge, who neither began the day in San Diego nor seemed to have made a decision by the time MLB’s inaugural draft lottery — won by the Pittsburgh Pirates — made a meek attempt to change the subject. Agent Scott Boras held his once-a-meetings media scrum. He is usually the man with the big stars at these meetings, and he has a few — but none of them are Judge.

One of those clients was Cody Bellinger, the enigmatic 2019 National League MVP who was not tendered a contract by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He agreed to a one-year deal worth $17.5 million with the Chicago Cubs, according to a person familiar with the situation. The Giants had been interested in adding Bellinger to their outfield, people familiar with their thinking said. But if they were going to lose out on a high-profile outfielder Tuesday, you could assume they would rather it be him. (They did add outfielder Mitch Haniger on a three-year deal worth $43.5 million, ESPN reported, but that would not preclude them from grabbing Judge, too.)

Another Boras client and elite outfielder, former New York Met Brandon Nimmo, was in San Diego this week meeting with teams. But his fate seemed tied to Judge’s, too.

“There is the expectation that certain clubs are waiting to move to the next step depending on the outcome” of Judge’s free agency, Boras told reporters.

Would the Giants need an outfielder if they lost out on Judge? If not, many teams have room for a speedy, steady, top-of-the-order bat such as Nimmo’s — if they are willing to spend what Boras will require for him. Even the Tampa Bay Rays, not known for prolific spending, have expressed interest, according to a person familiar with Nimmo’s market.

So Nimmo remained on the list of top-tier free agents yet to sign — some of whom could represent backup offensive additions for the Yankees or Giants if one missed out on Judge. Carlos Correa, Xander Bogaerts, catcher Willson Contreras and lefty Carlos Rodón remained unsigned as of late Tuesday, although righty Taijuan Walker agreed to a four-year, $72 million deal, per a person familiar with it, with the Philadelphia Phillies, who added pitching depth a day after grabbing star shortstop Trea Turner. The extent to which all of their markets depended on Judge will be clear in hindsight. But the extent of the speculation around them Tuesday was minuscule by comparison.

No one’s decision could set the baseball world ablaze as Judge’s appeared to do Tuesday, when the segments of baseball fandom that root against the Yankees were desperate to believe that where there’s smoke, there’s fire — and the Yankees prayed it was a false alarm.

437,Nationals land the No. 2 pick in MLB’s first draft lottery,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

SAN DIEGO — If it were any other year before this one, the Washington Nationals would have entered the offseason knowing they held the top pick in next year’s MLB draft. But for the first time — unluckily for the Nationals — MLB instituted a lottery, under the terms of the new collective bargaining agreement, in an attempt to reduce the incentive for teams to tank.

On Tuesday, the Nationals landed the No. 2 pick in the 2023 draft instead. They lost out to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who despite finishing this past season with the third-worst record in the major leagues had the same odds to land the top pick and will select first for the second time in three seasons. The No. 2 pick will be the Nationals’ highest since 2010, when they selected Bryce Harper.

The Detroit Tigers rounded out the top three. The Oakland Athletics, who with the Nationals and Pirates shared the best odds to land the top pick, dropped all the way to No. 6.

“When you’re picking that high in the draft, something poorly has happened the year before,” Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo said. “You don’t relish that situation, but it gives us a chance to make an impactful draft pick, so we’re excited.”

As the picks were slowly revealed in a ballroom at the Manchester Grand Hyatt — home of this year’s winter meetings — Nationals Manager Dave Martinez and members of the front office watched from a distance. They nodded their heads and pumped their fists when they were one of the final two teams remaining, though their reaction was more reserved when the card sporting a “2” had the Nationals’ logo on it.

Rizzo joked afterward that he wished the lottery would’ve started next year, when the Nationals might not have the most losses in baseball. Washington knows the benefit of having the top pick, after all; its No. 1 choices in 2009 and 2010 turned into Stephen Strasburg and Harper.

With the new CBA limiting how high teams can pick in the draft, the Nationals will not be able to pick higher than 10th in 2024, an MLB official said. Last season, the Nationals drafted high school outfielder Elijah Green with the No. 5 pick. Now, they’ll look to hit on the No. 2 pick next year before adding more talent in the later rounds.

“We’re excited to put another group of really good, impactful players into the system,” Rizzo said. “Along with the last two trade deadlines and the last three drafts, we feel really good about where our system is and seeing these players really ascending to the big leagues in the very near future.”

438,NFL best bets for Week 14: Pick against Deshaun Watson and the Browns,"Whether it was because Deshaun Watson was rusty or because their offense struggled with the midseason change at quarterback, the Browns’ offense wasn’t great on Sunday against the Texans . Cleveland won, 27-14, but its offense didn’t score a touchdown, with the team instead getting scores via fumble return, punt return and interception return. (It was only the fourth time since 2001 that one team got scores of that nature in the same game.) Of its 11 non-kneeldown drives, the Browns punted six times and had three others end because of turnovers or a safety, and one of its two field goals came after a drive of only eight yards. Watson averaged a terrible 3.91 adjusted yards per attempt.

The problem for Cleveland is that its defense (27th in DVOA) and special teams (25th in DVOA before Sunday’s game) usually are pretty lousy and likely can’t be counted upon to produce two games in a row, particularly when the opponent is not the awful Texans but rather a surging team like the Bengals, who have won four straight since a 32-13 loss to the Browns on Oct. 31.

This series will examine the impact of legalized gambling on sports, through news coverage, accountability journalism and advice for navigating this new landscape. Read more.

In that game, the Browns sacked Joe Burrow five times, which represents 20 percent of their total sacks this season. Burrow’s protection has gotten a lot better, however: In the season’s first eight games, ending with the first game against Cleveland, the Bengals were allowing 3.6 sacks per game. In the four games since that Browns loss, Cincinnati has given up only five sacks total.

The Browns’ rushing defense ranks 31st in DVOA, so the Bengals also shouldn’t have much trouble moving the ball with its running backs, whether it’s Joe Mixon (who has missed the past two games with a head injury) or Samaje Perine (who had 106 rushing yards against the Chiefs on Sunday while also catching six passes). Running backs are averaging 4.8 yards per attempt against the Browns (26th in the NFL).

With Watson clearly not in game shape and the Bengals on the rise, I’ll take the favorite here.

439,Baker Mayfield claimed by Rams after release from Panthers,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

In his third NFL stop in less than six months, Baker Mayfield is now a member of the Los Angeles Rams. The defending Super Bowl champions, off to a 3-9 start and possibly without starter Matthew Stafford for the rest of the season, claimed the fifth-year quarterback off waivers Tuesday, one day after Mayfield was released by the Carolina Panthers.

With the Rams set to play Thursday night against the Las Vegas Raiders, Mayfield is unlikely to see action right away, but his acquisition by the Rams suggests they have some interest in putting him on the field shortly thereafter. With Stafford sidelined for three of the past four games, Los Angeles has given starts to inexperienced backups John Wolford and Bryce Perkins with tepid results.

At a news conference Tuesday, Rams offensive coordinator Liam Coen said the team’s goal with Mayfield was not just to get a chance to see what he had but also, Coen suggested, to use the quarterback’s relatively steady hand to help “evaluate the offense, the other players.” Major injuries to Los Angeles’s top two receivers, Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson, have opened up playing time for younger, less tested wideouts such as Van Jefferson, Tutu Atwell and Brandon Powell.

The claim of Mayfield by the Rams, whose poor record placed them fourth this week in the NFL’s waiver order, prevented the division-rival San Francisco 49ers from possibly adding him. The 49ers lost starting quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo on Sunday to a regular season-ending broken foot, and they are expected to start seventh-round rookie Brock Purdy in his place.

The Baltimore Ravens might have been another candidate to make a bid for Mayfield, in the wake of Lamar Jackson’s knee injury that Coach John Harbaugh described as week-to-week, although they have a promising backup in Tyler Huntley. Rams Coach Sean McVay said Monday that Wolford was day-to-day with neck soreness, possibly increasing the team’s sense of urgency about bolstering the position.

Stafford missed time last month while in the concussion protocol and was placed on injured reserve Saturday. McVay revealed Sunday that the 14th-year quarterback had a bruised spinal cord and opined there was “a good chance” Stafford would not return in 2022.

As with Stafford, Mayfield was a No. 1 draft pick, but their subsequent paths have taken very different turns. Whereas the former used a breakout third season to become a decade-long mainstay for the Detroit Lions, Mayfield followed a third season with the Cleveland Browns in which he led them to their first playoff win in 26 years with a fourth year marked by injuries, inconsistent play and a testy situation involving wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. that reportedly affected the Browns’ locker room.

In the wake of that 2021 campaign, which saw Cleveland go 8-9 and miss the postseason, the team made a blockbuster deal with the Houston Texans for quarterback Deshaun Watson, signaling that the Mayfield era was over. Mayfield asked for a trade and eventually was dealt to the Panthers in July for a conditional fifth-round selection in the 2024 draft.

“I’ve got a lot of respect for him,” Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris said Tuesday of Mayfield. “This guy was a very good football player, brought Cleveland from pretty much the ashes. This game is sometimes thankless. When you get a chance to acquire a guy who’s got nothing to lose and something to prove, it’s always awesome.”

Over seven appearances and six starts with Carolina, Mayfield was a disappointment, completing just 57.8 percent of his passes for 1,313 yards, six touchdowns, six interceptions and a career-low 74.4 passer rating. By one advanced metric that combines expected points added per play and completion percentage above expected (per rbsdm.com), Mayfield has performed by far the worst of any qualified quarterback this season.

Nevertheless, the Rams appear to have little to lose by giving him a shot. Los Angeles doesn’t have much incentive to tank, given that it owes its first-round pick next year to the Lions as the final payment in its 2021 trade for Stafford.

With the Browns having picked up the fifth-year option in Mayfield’s rookie contract, he will be a free agent after this season. Coen said Stafford remained “the future” for the Rams at quarterback, adding that with Mayfield, the team feels “obviously pretty good about somebody who can come in here and compete at a high level for us.”

“Only heard great things about him as a person, as a teammate and we know as a competitor, he’s the type of guy who’s going to go out and compete his tail off,” Coen said Tuesday. “Glad to have him in the [quarterbacks] room, for sure.”

440,"No. 13 Maryland can’t find its way in Wisconsin, suffers its first loss","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

MADISON, Wis. — The Maryland men’s basketball team got off to a soaring start under Coach Kevin Willard. The Terrapins cruised past some quality opponents, then deftly navigated their first tight contest to defeat a ranked foe in their Big Ten opener. But Maryland had not yet experienced a sizable deficit like the one it faced in its first conference road test at Wisconsin.

After a lethargic start against the physical Badgers, Willard’s team rallied with force Tuesday night at Kohl Center. But when his No. 13 Terps needed to seize control in the second half, they succumbed to sloppy play and scoring droughts. The Badgers pounced on those flaws, handing Maryland a 64-59 loss to end the perfect start to Willard’s debut season in College Park.

“We hurt ourselves because we didn’t take advantage of some of the opportunities we have,” Willard said. “They’re an excellent defensive team. You have to give them a lot of credit for them taking us out of our offense.”

The Terps (8-1, 1-1) climbed back from down 12 in the first half, and they secured a narrow edge midway through the second. But then they went nearly eight minutes without making a shot from the field, missing 10 in a row. In that time, Wisconsin took control and built an 11-point lead. Julian Reese missed a pair of free throws, Donta Scott missed the front end of a one-and-one, and the Terps couldn’t hit shots from close range — all missed chances to keep the game from slipping away.

By the time Jahmir Young and Don Carey converted from beyond the arc in the final minutes, it was too late. The Badgers (7-2, 1-0) handled Maryland’s pressure and hit enough free throws to keep the desperate Terps from pulling off a late miracle.

The Terps racked up 14 turnovers, including eight after halftime, compared with Wisconsin’s eight giveaways and just three after the break. Maryland finished the game shooting just 35.5 percent from two-point range, and two of its most dependable players — Hakim Hart (five points on 2-for-10 shooting) and Scott (nine points on 3-for-14 shooting) — had lackluster showings.

Entering this matchup, the Terps had dominated most games. Even when they edged then-No. 16 Illinois on Friday, they held the lead for much of the evening. Maryland had trailed for roughly eight of the 320 minutes it had played, but Tuesday, Maryland didn’t grab the lead until Reese hit a floater early in the second half.

After that, the Terps went five minutes without scoring, committing six turnovers in that stretch. The game didn’t slip away quite yet thanks to Wisconsin’s poor shooting. But when the Terps endured another cold stretch, the Badgers capitalized with a 16-4 run that turned Maryland’s one-point lead with 11:24 to go into an 11-point Wisconsin advantage with 3:46 left.

Before the game, Willard, who coached in the Big East for 12 years at Seton Hall, described Wisconsin as “the Big Ten version of Villanova” because the Badgers are “not flashy” but instead “super steady.” They showed that Tuesday, wearing down the Terps and maintaining their poise despite some offensive struggles.

Here’s what else to know about Maryland’s first loss:

Reese’s test

Reese had several standout showings during nonconference play, including a 22-point burst in the first half against Coppin State, but Maryland’s previous two opponents, Louisville and Illinois, contained the sophomore. Reese had just 11 points combined in those games, and many Big Ten teams have frontcourt players who will pose significant challenges.

Wisconsin’s starting forwards — 7-foot Steven Crowl and 6-9 Tyler Wahl — were Maryland’s toughest test yet. They combined for 21 points, and Reese struggled on defense. (Wahl, matched up against Scott, didn’t have a great shooting night, finishing 3 for 10 for nine points.)

Willard described Wahl and Crowl as “great passers” out of the post, and with their teammates making shots from the perimeter, “they’re a tough guard,” he said.

Reese produced on the other end, finishing with 10 points on 4-for-6 shooting. He was second on the team in scoring behind Young, who had 17 points. Reese grabbed six rebounds while adding two assists and three turnovers. He committed his fourth foul with 9:52 left, forcing Maryland to lean on a smaller lineup for a few minutes.

Reese said he felt more comfortable as the game went on. Reese, a sophomore in his first season as a starter, will continue to draw difficult matchups as the conference slate goes on.

Slow start

The Terps began the game unable to knock down three-pointers despite some good looks, and they struggled to finish around the rim. Maryland missed five three-pointers before Scott finally hit one nearly seven minutes in, and it took the Terps another 8½ minutes to sink their second basket from deep.

The Badgers exploited Maryland’s defense with their size in the paint and crisp passing. Their lead swelled as they hit 9 of 14 shots to start the game.

“It was definitely a challenge,” Young, a transfer from Charlotte still adjusting to Big Ten play, said of Wisconsin’s physicality. “Definitely had to kind of feel my way into that early on. I feel like we had a couple defensive lapses early to help them get going and we were a little stagnant on the offensive end.”

After the Terps had fallen into their double-digit hole, they surged back into the game with an 11-0 run. Maryland had struggled from the perimeter, but during that burst, it hit three straight. Carey later hit a three-pointer in the final minute before halftime to tie the score. From there, neither team had a lead of more than four points until Wisconsin capitalized on Maryland’s late drought to tilt the game in its favor.

441,"E-cigarette firm Juul settles 5,000 lawsuits amid teen vaping concerns","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Juul Labs, the e-cigarette manufacturer, announced on Tuesday that it has reached settlements covering more than 5,000 cases with nearly 10,000 plaintiffs. The sweeping resolutions, which litigators say will address youth e-cigarette usage, come after more than three years of legal battles. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The settlements include compensation for those suffering from nicotine addiction and other health problems as well as reimbursement for those who purchased Juul products. School districts, cities, counties and Native American tribes will also receive resources to fight nicotine addiction among youths. Juul did not disclose the settlement amount.

Sarah R. London, co-lead counsel for plaintiffs in the federal multidistrict litigation, expressed hope for the potential impact of the resolutions.

“These settlements will put meaningful compensation in [the] hands of victims and their families, get real funds to schools for abatement programs, and help government and tribal entities prevent youth use of e-cigarettes across the U.S.,” she said in a written statement.

Advertisement

But Robert Jackler, a Stanford medical school professor who researches the impact of tobacco advertising and served as an expert witness in the proceedings, was less optimistic.

“Time and again, tobacco companies absorb sizable legal settlements as a cost of doing business, only [to] reemerge as highly profitable purveyors [of] nicotine products, which they market to youth,” he said in an email. If Juul survives the financial and reputational blow, “it will escape full accountability for its reprehensive corporate behavior,” he said.

The settlement is the latest development in a spate of legal feuds and public controversies afflicting the once-thriving e-cigarette company.

Partially owned by tobacco giant Altria, Juul has come under fire for marketing to minors, fueling an increase in youth vaping and misrepresenting their products as a safe alternative to conventional cigarettes. While e-cigarettes have not existed long enough to determine their long-term health consequences, they have been linked to nicotine addiction, lung damage, asthma and mental health problems.

Earlier this year, Juul products were temporarily banned by the Food and Drug Administration, which cited insufficient data on their health and safety. (The ban was later put on hold.) In September, Juul agreed to pay $438.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought by 33 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, which alleged that the company targeted youths and whitewashed the risks of using its products.

Last month, the company announced it would lay off hundreds of employees, cut its operating budget by 30 to 40 percent and stave off bankruptcy, having secured investor financing.

Juul debuted its e-cigarette — a sleek, handheld electronic device used to inhale nicotine mixed with flavoring — in 2015. Originally sold as an innocuous, even fun alternative to traditional tobacco products, the device quickly became popular among youths. A 2019 Washington Post article about teen addiction to e-cigarettes noted that high school students had started referring to the school bathroom as the “Juul room.” They remain prevalent in 2022; a study released in October found that 2.5 million adolescents use e-cigarettes.

Philip C. Federico, an attorney representing 60 school districts — including Prince George’s County and Anne Arundel County — in the litigation against Juul called the settlement a “tremendous victory.”

“The funds from this agreement will allow school districts to recover the costs of combating this epidemic, which has included hiring counselors, installing monitoring equipment and dedicating other resources to vaping mitigation instead of education,” he said in an email.

Federico said litigators will continue legal action against Altria, which is also being sued for its role in youth vaping.

442,"Financial aid letters are difficult to understand, GAO report finds","Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

When you buy a home, lenders must provide you with a standardized form that includes the loan terms, the projected monthly payment and details about fees and other mortgage costs. If you use a credit card, the monthly statement must disclose how long it would take to pay off your balance if you make only the minimum payment each month.

Buying a car from a dealership? By federal law, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price must be placed on the window of the vehicle. Of course, you might pay more or less, but at least there’s a baseline for reference.

But woe to the many students and families trying to figure out the net cost of a college education.

The financial aid letters colleges issue are supposed to help students determine how much they can afford. But they aren’t as helpful as they should be and, in many cases, can be misleading, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office.

Advertisement

The GAO, the nonpartisan congressional agency that serves as the government’s primary watchdog, reviewed financial aid offers from 176 colleges sent to undergraduate students who were offered full-time enrollment for the 2021-2022 academic year. The sample included two-year and four-year public, nonprofit and for-profit colleges. The schools were assessed against 10 best practices from the Education Department and a commission representing 22 federal agencies.

Schools that followed the best practices would itemize direct and indirect costs in their price estimates and wouldn’t downplay that much of that aid is actually in the form of loans. The letters wouldn’t call work study an “award” when students aren’t guaranteed campus jobs.

“Most colleges are not following best practices for providing clear and standard information in their financial aid offers,” the GAO report said.

Advertisement

The watchdog found that an estimated 91 percent of colleges — a staggering percentage — underestimate or don’t bother to include the net price in their offers, making it hard for families to calculate how much they will need to pay for school.

While millions of debtors await a Supreme Court decision on the fate of the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness program, the GAO report exposes the absurdity of financial aid letters.

Students and families rely on these letters to compare college offers and the types and amounts of financial aid for which they’re eligible. However, the information they need to keep them out of crushing debt can’t be found in these letters.

“The main problem is these award letters are clear as mud,” said Mark Kantrowitz, a financial aid expert and author of “How to Appeal for More College Financial Aid.” “They lack clarity on what’s a loan and what’s a grant.”

Advertisement

What should the letters include? Here’s the GAO’s list of 10 best practices.

1. Direct and indirect costs are itemized. Yes, tuition, room and board make up most college costs. But families ought to understand that other expenses can result in additional borrowing. Books, transportation and personal expenses can be daunting for many students.

2. Provide a total cost of attendance that includes key expenses. Partial or incomplete information may result in students underestimating affordability.

3. Estimate the real net price. Offers should provide the actual bottom-line amount families are expected to pay out of pocket, which for many includes heavy borrowing. About a quarter of the schools didn’t provide any information about college costs in their financial aid offers, according to the GAO report.

4. Separate the free money, loans and work study. Schools often underplay how much students may need to borrow. “You hardly ever see them mentioning an interest rate or a loan payment,” Kantrowitz said. “They often refer to loans with cryptic acronyms. This makes it difficult for families to know what they’re getting into.”

One school may offer most aid in the form of a grant. Another might require more work study to bring down the cost of attendance. But working too much can affect a student’s academic performance. And many students got into financial trouble during the pandemic when their work-study jobs were cut because of the coronavirus.

5. Don’t include a PLUS loan. If a parent loan (for Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students) is listed, make sure students differentiate this type of borrowing from their own, the GAO recommended.

6. Label the type of aid being offered. A good letter should provide a clear breakdown of grants and scholarships vs. loans vs. student employment.

Advertisement

“When it comes to financial aid, some letters will mix the loans in with the grants without separating them out,” Kantrowitz said. “They treat loans as though it’s reducing college costs, and they don’t.”

7. Label the source of aid. Federal loans come with better borrower protections than private loans, which are often more expensive.

8. Include actionable next steps. Schools should be clear about opportunities for families to negotiate a better financial offer.

9. Emphasize the key details and distinctions in the different aid. Such details “might include information about minimum academic requirements to maintain a scholarship or explaining that work-study is not guaranteed since students need to apply for these jobs on campus,” the GAO report said.

Schools often front-load aid for freshmen as a recruiting tactic, Kantrowitz pointed out. But in subsequent years, the free money may be greatly reduced. Or loans may make up more of the financial aid package after the first year.

Advertisement

Work study might limit a student’s ability to participate in extracurricular activities.

10. Don’t refer to the financial aid offer as an “award.” Work study isn’t guaranteed. And a loan is not an award. It’s a debt.

Federal law does not require colleges to provide clear or standardized information in their financial aid offers. The GAO recommends that Congress change that and compel colleges to do so. Because borrowers can spend decades carrying debt for college, better financial aid disclosure is long overdue.

443,Hertz to pay $168M after falsely accusing customers of stealing rental cars,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Hertz said Monday it will pay $168 million to settle hundreds of claims by customers who were falsely reported by the rental car company as having stolen its vehicles, with some innocent renters arrested and jailed for weeks or months over the reports. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Hertz said in a brief statement that it was settling 364 claims, which it said amounted to 95 percent of the outstanding claims against the company over the false theft reports.

Dozens of customers had shared stories on social media and broadcast television programs of being arrested, “swatted” or stopped at border crossings after Hertz had incorrectly reported them to the authorities for stealing vehicles from its rental fleet.

In many of the cases, the customer had paid for and properly returned the car weeks or months prior — or had never rented a car at all.

Drew Seaser, a real estate appraiser in Colorado, learned of a warrant for his arrest in Georgia when he was stopped at the airport on the way to Mexico with his family. Seaser told CBS News that he had never been to Georgia nor rented a car from Hertz. He was jailed for more than 24 hours; the charges were dismissed after his lawyer provided prosecutors with an alibi.

Paul-Anthony Knight said on “Inside Edition” that he was arrested after Hertz incorrectly filed a theft report against him. “All guns drawn on me. I was thrown to the ground. I was arrested. And I was locked up for over a week,” he said. Another man, Julius Burnside, told the program that he was jailed for more than six months over an erroneous report.

It was not immediately clear whether Seaser, Knight and Burnside were among the claimants who settled with Hertz, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2021. An attorney for dozens of customers who sued Hertz in Delaware did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hertz said in February that “the vast majority of these cases involve renters who were many weeks or even months overdue returning vehicles and who stopped communicating with us well beyond the scheduled due date.”

But Hertz chief executive Stephen M. Scherr was more apologetic, saying in April on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that “it’s not acceptable to Hertz to have any customer, a single customer sort of caught up in some of what’s happened.” He said the issue of false theft reports was “among the first things” he dealt with since taking the helm of the company in February. “Several hundred people” were impacted by the reports, he said.

Erroneous reports were withdrawn when they were discovered, Scherr said, “yet these people got caught, you know, in a moment” when the rescinding of the reports “wasn’t recognized” by law enforcement. The false reports were “unfortunate,” he said.

Marisa Iati contributed to this report.

444,PepsiCo layoffs could indicate broader economic woes,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

PepsiCo is reportedly cutting hundreds of corporate jobs at its North American snacks and beverage divisions, making it the latest on a growing list of big companies to slash its workforce as inflation remains elevated and the risk of recession persists. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The layoffs, which the soda giant has not publicly confirmed, are another sign that companies across different industries are bracing for a tighter economic environment. The Wall Street Journal reported the cuts Tuesday, citing internal documents and people familiar with the matter.

Some of the nation’s largest employers in retail and technology, including Walmart, Amazon and Facebook parent Meta, have slashed thousands of positions in recent weeks. That’s on top of significant reductions in the media world, including at CNN and Gannett newspapers. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

But companies are increasingly targeting corporate and white-collar workers, keeping front-line and customer-facing staff intact. And though many large retailers hired heavily for the holiday shopping season, they still scaled back, attuned to rising labor costs.

The PepsiCo cuts may not be huge numerically — the company had about 129,000 employees in the United States at the end of last year — but what they signal is “more ominous,” according to retail analyst Neil Saunders.

“If a company performing well, with earnings and revenue up solidly in recent quarters, is reducing its workforce then it is likely others will be considering similar moves,” he said in an emailed statement.

The layoffs follow what company leaders say was a strong third quarter: Net revenue surged 8.8 percent during the three-month period and had grown 7.7 percent since the start of the year. The stock is up more than 4.5 percent in 2022.

PepsiCo, which produces snacks like Doritos and Lay’s chips and such beverages as Gatorade, Bubly, Aquafina and its namesake soft drinks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post.

The company, which has a market cap of $252.3 billion, is simply signaling the head winds to come, said Tom Essaye, president of Sevens Report Research.

“This is really confirming so many other signs that we are headed toward a potentially pretty significant economic slowdown,” he said.

Even so, the labor market has shown remarkable resiliency as the Federal Reserve tightens interest rates in an effort to crush inflation. The U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday — a slight drop from October but still above historic norms.

The puzzling economic picture has economists split on whether the United States will enter a recession sometime next year, especially as high-profile layoffs and hiring slowdowns continue to play out. Disney, AMC Networks and Cisco have all announced significant staff reductions. BuzzFeed said in a filing Tuesday that it would cut about 12 percent of its workforce. Amazon is expected to cut about 10,000 corporate workers, a big turnaround after the e-commerce giant’s years of massive growth. Meta said it would slash 11,000 staff members, and Google and others announced hiring slowdowns.

It is unclear whether the tech and media layoffs are a harbinger of recession, but the spread to other industries has some analysts and observers increasingly wary. Ford Motor Co., DoorDash and H&M have all announced deep cuts in recent months. On Tuesday, CNBC reported that the global investment bank Morgan Stanley eliminated about 2 percent of its workforce, affecting 1,600 people.

Large-scale hiring freezes and job cuts among white-collar workers began in earnest this summer, with tech companies hit especially hard. Several experts say these businesses arguably hired more than they needed during the past several years, when capital was freely available and the pandemic boosted many big tech firms’ bottom lines.

The tens of thousands of tech workers let go this year may mark the end of a historically strong decade for the industry, and economists say there could be spillover implications for other businesses as the economy shows signs of slowing.

The PepsiCo layoffs will target its beverage division in Purchase, N.Y., and its snacks and packaged-food business, headquartered both in Chicago and in Plano, Tex., according to the Journal.

A memo to staff explained that the layoffs were meant “to simplify the organization so we can operate more efficiently,” the Journal reported.

During its most recent quarterly earnings call, chief executive Ramon Laguarta said that the company’s brands were “being stretched to higher price points” and that consumers were following.

While inflation can sometimes bring in more money for companies, even as production costs increase, Essaye noted that higher prices will eventually constrict demand.

PepsiCo’s biggest competitor, Coca-Cola Co., said last month that it would offer voluntary buyouts to some workers, a tactic companies use to reduce their workforces.

“For now, a lot of firms are making small moves on labor as they wait to see how 2023 will shape up,” Saunders said in his statement. “However, if things deteriorate then the pace of layoffs could become more substantial. This, rather than inflation, could become the major economic problem in 2023.”

445,Swirled brownies make a simple dessert even better,"Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Chewy (or cakey), fudgy, deeply chocolate-y, and preferably crinkly topped, brownies just do it better than any other sweet treat I can think of. As flawless as they are, there’s a little something you can do to make brownies even better. Enter the swirl. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight With just a few ingredients and a few minutes, you can add flavor, color and pizazz to the humble (but always fabulous) brownie. Moreover, despite how terrific they look, swirls atop a brownie are super easy to achieve. Here, you’ll not only find swirl technique 101, but also flavor and color variations. Try these and then let them inspire you to come up with your own.

After years of brownie research, I have locked in my preferences: Chewy, crinkly topped brownies are the best brownies. Using both cocoa powder and melted chocolate gives deep flavor and fudginess. And I strongly believe that brownies should be easy to make (one bowl, no stand mixer required). But I do depart from my standard in one major way: Swirled brownies need leavening.

Advertisement

In general, I believe it is a sacrilege to add leavening to brownie batter (as it causes cakiness), but when swirling, I change my tune. The leavening gives the brownies a little lift, which helps them hold their swirl while baking.

Many ingredients can be swirled into brownies, but I’m partial to cream cheese, melted chocolate and nut (or seed) butters. The trick with swirls is to assemble something that is pourable, but not runny, so that when you drizzle or “plop” (it’s a technical, brownie swirling term) the swirl mixture atop your brownie, it stays put until you are ready to drag your skewer or the tip of your paring knife through to create gorgeous, loopy swirls. Creating cream cheese and nut butter swirls calls for the same technique, but melted chocolate swirls are created a little differently.

The recipe below, including these three swirling techniques, is suitable for an 8-inch square baking pan.

Cream cheese swirls

Ingredients: A cream cheese swirl, and I’m partial to the Philadelphia brand, is made by combining a cup of room temperature cream cheese, an egg or egg yolk, some sugar and a little vanilla extract and salt. Cream cheese swirls can be tinted different colors and flavored with different extracts, as cream cheese is a wonderful blank canvas. I like to add almond extract to my swirl for a chocolate-almond brownie situation, and red food coloring, plus peppermint extract, for a pink peppermint brownie worthy of holiday entertaining. When mixing the ingredients together, whisk only until the mixture is smooth. You don’t want a lumpy swirl, but you also don’t want the cream cheese to lose structure and become runny.

Advertisement

Technique: When you transfer the batter to the prepared pan, reserve some of it to use when swirling. With a small 1 1/2 tablespoon portion scoop if you have it, or measuring spoons, plop about 9 scoops of cream cheese swirl (3 rows of 3) evenly over the brownie batter. Clean the scoop and portion out the extra brownie batter, plopping it in between the cream cheese. Now, drag a long wooden skewer (my preference) or the tip of a paring knife through each row of cream cheese and brownie plops horizontally (left to right, and then right to left), never lifting the tool from the batter, and then through each row vertically. If you drizzle or plop your swirl over all of the batter, rather than reserving some of it, your swirls will not be thoroughly incorporated into the brownie batter and will be less dramatic.

Nut and seed butter swirls

Ingredients: A seed butter swirl, such as tahini, requires about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of the chosen butter plus a little sugar, vanilla and salt. Use a fresh jar or reincorporate any oil that has separated in the jar by heating the butter and stirring until smooth. When making a nut butter swirl, you can use as much as 3/4 cup, because nut butters tend to be stiffer than tahini and hold their shape better when swirled. You can add sugar if you like and a little melted butter to thin the swirl, if necessary.

Advertisement

Technique: Use the same reserved batter and “plop” technique for swirling with cream cheese when swirling with seed and nut butters.

Melted chocolate swirl

Ingredients: A melted chocolate swirl requires about 4 ounces of chocolate. Unlike a cream cheese or nut/seed butter swirl, a chocolate swirl really needs no other ingredients, but I like to add a little extract and color if working with white chocolate. And if making a milk or dark chocolate swirl, add flavored extract. For instance, 1/4 teaspoon of orange extract in a dark chocolate swirl would be pretty delicious.

Technique When swirling with melted chocolate, you do not need to reserve any brownie batter. The melted chocolate swirls look the best post-bake when they are created directly on the surface of the brownies. With a 1-teaspoon measuring spoon dollop the melted chocolate over the batter, about 12 times, creating 4 rows of 3. Drag a wooden skewer or the tip of a paring knife through each row of melted chocolate horizontally (left to right, and then right to left), never lifting the tool from the batter, and then through each row vertically.

Swirling brownies like a pro is easier than you’d think (particularly when armed with my handy tips) In other words, we’re talking big swirl bang for the brownie buck.

Brownies With Cheesecake, Tahini or White Chocolate-Peppermint Swirl

If you’re making non-swirled brownies, feel free to add your favorite toasted nuts. Also, both the cheesecake swirl and white chocolate swirls are infinitely riffable: The cheesecake can be flavored with almond extract and the brownies sprinkled with toasted almonds for a Viennese brownie. The white chocolate can be flavored with espresso powder, or add a little raspberry jam for brownies with a fruity-chocolate vibe.

Storage: Refrigerate cheesecake or tahini swirl brownies in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Store white chocolate-peppermint swirl brownies at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Ingredients

For the brownies

Nonstick cooking spray (optional)

6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, diced, plus more optional for greasing the pan (optional)

2/3 cup (53 grams) Dutch process cocoa powder

1/3 cup (57 grams) semisweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

1/2 teaspoon fine salt

3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar

1/4 cup (50 grams) light brown sugar

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

2 large eggs, at room temperature

1 large egg yolk, at room temperature

1/2 teaspoon baking powder

3/4 cup (94 grams) all-purpose flour

Step 1

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Grease an 8-inch square cake pan with nonstick cooking spray or softened butter. Line the bottom with a piece of parchment paper long enough to have an overhang over two opposite sides of the pan.

Step 2

In a large, microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, oil and salt and microwave on HIGH in 30-second bursts three to four times, whisking after each, until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, combine the ingredients in a heatproof bowl, nestled over a pot of barely simmering water — don’t let the bottom of the bowl touch the water — whisking occasionally, until melted and smooth.)

Advertisement

Step 3

Immediately whisk in the granulated and brown sugars and the vanilla until combined. The batter will be thick and will clump up a bit on the whisk. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the yolk, until incorporated, then whisk in the baking powder until combined. Using a flexible spatula, fold in the flour until the last streak of it disappears; do not overmix.

Step 4

If making the cheesecake or tahini swirl brownies (see VARIATIONS): Scrape about a half to two-thirds of the thick batter into the prepared pan and smooth it out with an offset spatula. Dollop the swirl mixture over the batter in 3 rows of 3, for total of 9 dollops. Then, place dollops of the remaining brownie batter in and around the swirled dollops, so that the swirl dollops still show. Drag a long wooden skewer, or the tip of a paring knife, through the dollops of swirl, first by dragging down vertically and then by dragging up vertically, never removing the skewer as you do so. Once you’ve dragged through each row vertically, do the same horizontally.

Advertisement

If making the white chocolate-peppermint brownies (see VARIATIONS): Scrape all of the batter into the prepared pan, dollop teaspoons of the white chocolate-peppermint evenly over the top and drag your skewer through them as described above.

Step 6

Bake for 35 to 40 minutes for a cheesecake swirl brownie; 25 to 30 minutes for plain, tahini swirl or white chocolate-peppermint swirl brownies; or until a cake tester inserted in the middle of the pan into the brownie portion, not the swirl, comes out with a few moist crumbs, rotating the pan at the halfway point. Do not overbake.

Step 7

Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely in the pan, about 2 hours. Using the parchment overhang, lift the brownie out of the pan (if you meet any resistance, gently run a butter knife around the edges.)

Variations

Here is how to make each of the suggested swirls.

Advertisement

Cheesecake Swirl

8 ounces (226 grams) full-fat cream cheese, preferably the Philadelphia brand, at room temperature

1/3 cup (40 grams) confectioners’ sugar

1 large egg

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/8 teaspoon fine salt

In a medium bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, confectioners’ sugar, egg, vanilla and salt until combined. Set aside while you assemble the brownies.

Tahini Swirl

1/3 cup (83 grams) tahini, stirred until smooth

3 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar

1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/8 teaspoon fine salt

In a small bowl, whisk together the tahini, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla and salt until combined. Set aside while you assemble the brownies.

Pro tip: This swirl works best with fresh tahini that is well-blended. If the oil has separated from the paste, decant the tahini to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high in 30-second bursts, stirring after each, until emulsified and smooth. You can also do this over a pot of simmering water on the stovetop. To help keep the tahini emulsified after mixing, you can store it in the refrigerator.

White Chocolate-Peppermint Swirl

4 ounces (113 grams) white chocolate, melted and cooled (see Pro tips)

1 teaspoon peppermint extract, or more as needed (see Pro tips)

10 drops green food coloring, or more as desired (optional)

2 tablespoons crushed candy canes or another peppermint candy, such as Starlight Peppermints Mints brand (optional; see Pro tips)

In a small bowl, gently whisk together the chocolate, peppermint extract and food coloring, if using, until combined. Set aside while you assemble the brownies.

Pro tips: To melt the white chocolate, microwave on HIGH in 30-second bursts a few times, whisking after each, until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, combine the ingredients in a heatproof bowl, nestled over a pot of barely simmering water, but don’t let the bottom of the bowl touch the water. Whisk occasionally, until melted and smooth.) If the chocolate is difficult to whisk after you’ve added the extract and food coloring, microwave for an additional 5 to 10 seconds to soften it. It should be cool to the touch before adding it to the brownies.

If adding crushed peppermint candy to the brownies, 5 minutes before the baking time is up, sprinkle the candy over the top of the brownies.

To give the white chocolate-peppermint swirl brownies more peppermint flavor, use an additional 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract in place of 1 teaspoon of the vanilla extract in the brownie batter and reduce the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon. About 5 minutes before the baking time is up, sprinkle the crushed candy over the top of the brownies, if desired.

446,"Instant Pot beef stroganoff that you can make dairy-free, too","Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

When someone tells me they have a healthier version of a favorite comfort food, I’m often a little skeptical. Aren’t you? In her latest cookbook, “Healthy in a Hurry,” Danielle Walker offers plenty of gluten-, grain- and dairy-free options in more than 150 recipes — many with fewer than 10 ingredients.

Her goal is to give people lots of options for eating well even when time is tight. Her definition of healthy is “whatever makes my body feel the most vibrant and free of symptoms and ailments.” For her, that means a paleo diet full of vegetables, fruits and “good-quality” proteins. She avoids grains, dairy, beans, additives, seed oils and processed sugars.

I can get on board with processed sugars, but the others are part of the way I eat, and I want that variety. (Yes, I eat some additives, too, including MSG!) Still, I do try to cut down on sodium (I noticed Walker suggests coconut aminos in her stir-fry sauce recipes, and while I usually can’t be happy with cauliflower rice, I can mix some into my regular rice to get vegetables and cut the carbs.)

Advertisement

I learned a lot by reading through her cookbook of building-block sauces and condiments and by exploring the various ways she addresses making substitutions without sacrificing flavor and texture.

When I saw she had a fresh take on beef stroganoff, I jumped on it. This is a dish I love but haven’t made in years. Walker has fond feelings for it as well. When she was a child, her mother made it using Hamburger Helper and then added both sour cream and canned cream of mushroom soup, which were ingredients common to her mom’s everyday casseroles.

Walker still craves her mother’s one-pot meals, so she re-created this one, which has become a favorite among her readers, she said. She claims it is even easier to make than her mother’s version. She offers multicooker versions that allow you to go the Instant Pot route or the slow cooker path. We tested both.

Work your way through the recipe and you’ll see that Walker suggests ghee or avocado oil as the fat in the dish. Because I eat dairy, it’s easy for me to simply use 1/3 cup of sour cream, but she also recommends dairy-free heavy (or sour) cream. If you don’t want to use a nondairy product, she suggests this option as well: Omit the sour cream and in its place add 2 1/4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice and 1 3/4 teaspoon apple cider vinegar when you add the broth. Whisk 1/4 cup unsweetened raw cashew butter with the arrowroot or cornstarch and water. I tried it in the Instant Pot version and it worked just fine, too.

Advertisement

She also recommends serving the rich, meaty stew with cauliflower rice, grain-free noodles or roasted potatoes. You’re free to do that, but I knew my craving would not be satiated by anything other than egg noodles. You’ll see the nutritional analysis offers versions with and without the noodles, so you can decide which vegetable or starch makes the most sense for you.

Cooking, like life, is all about choices.

Instant Pot Beef Stroganoff

We tested this recipe in a 6-quart Instant Pot and a slow cooker.

To use a slow cooker: Brown the meat and onion on the stovetop, then transfer them to the slow cooker. Increase the broth to 1 1/4 cups, add all of the remaining ingredients except the sour cream mixture, cover, and cook on low for 8 hours or on high for 4 hours. Stir in the sour cream mixture and continue as directed. (If you want your slow-cooked sauce thicker, you can transfer it to the stovetop before adding the sour cream mixture. Place it in a pan over medium-high heat and cook it, stirring frequently, until it thickens, 2 to 3 minutes.)

Advertisement

Note: Coconut aminos, a brown liquid seasoning made from the fermented sap of the coconut palm blossom, is gluten- and soy-free. If you don’t have coconut aminos, you can use soy sauce or simply omit.

Storage: Refrigerate the stroganoff and noodles separately for up to 4 days.

Ingredients

2 tablespoons ghee, avocado oil or another neutral oil

1 small yellow onion (5 ounces), diced

1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt, divided

3 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

8 ounces white button mushrooms, chopped

1/2 cup no-salt-added beef broth, plus more as needed

4 cloves garlic, minced or finely grated

3 tablespoons coconut aminos (optional; see NOTE)

1/2 teaspoon dried thyme

1/2 cup sour cream (may substitute dairy-free sour cream)

1 tablespoon arrowroot powder or cornstarch

1 tablespoon water

Cooked egg noodles, cauliflower rice, rice or boiled potatoes, for serving

Step 1

Set a programmable multicooker (such as an Instant Pot) to SAUTE. Let the pot heat for 2 minutes, then add the ghee or oil, onion and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and saute until the onion begins to soften, 3 to 4 minutes.

Step 2

Season the beef all over with the remaining salt and the pepper. Working in batches, add the meat to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned on all sides, about 2 minutes. As each batch browns, transfer it to a clean plate. When all the meat is browned, press the CANCEL button.

Step 3

Return the browned meat and any accumulated juices to the pot and add the mushrooms, broth, garlic, coconut aminos, if using, and thyme, and stir until combined. Make sure the steam valve is sealed. Select PRESSURE (HIGH) and set to 20 minutes. (It may take about 5 minutes for the appliance to come to pressure before cooking begins.)

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, arrowroot or cornstarch, and water.

Step 4

After 20 minutes, release the pressure manually by moving the pressure-release handle to vent, covering your hand with a towel or oven mitt. Never put your hands or face near the vent when releasing steam. Stir in the sour cream mixture, return the pot to SAUTE and bring the sauce to a boil. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens and is creamy, adding more broth if desired, 2 to 3 minutes.

447,Which multi-resort ski pass is best? We compared 4.,"By The Way Which multi-resort ski pass is best? We compared 4. Buying a ski pass for multiple mountains could save you money in the long run A skier rides a gondola over a snowy mountain in Colorado. (Maridav/Shutterstock)

Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

Imagine a ski season in which you hop from mountain to mountain but never have to care about the increasingly steep price of a lift ticket. Those other skiers and snowboarders griping about how a day on the slopes costs the same as a new Apple Watch? You can’t relate. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight What differentiates you from other vacationers is neither stock options nor a winning Powerball ticket but a wise, one-season investment: a multi-resort pass.

“Is it economical to buy a ski pass? Heck yes!” said Sunshine Swetnam, an assistant professor in Colorado State University’s ski area management master’s program. “I would be blown away if the pass ever becomes a bad thing.”

The multi-resort pass is a fairly new development. In 2008, Vail Resorts introduced the Epic Pass, a spinoff of the singular resort season pass. Instead of locking visitors into one mountain, Vail’s pass granted winter sports enthusiasts unlimited and unrestricted access to four resorts in Colorado and one in California.

Advertisement

That all-you-can-ski deal was also a bargain, relatively speaking. According to Sara Olson, vice president of communications for Vail Resorts, Epic initially cost $579, significantly less than an individual resort pass, which averaged $1,800. In addition, the bulk price was much kinder on the wallet than the a la carte fee. The same truth holds today, when same-day tickets can cost upward of $200 or more.

“The pass pays for itself after four days or in one vacation,” said Adrienne Saia Isaac, director of marketing and communications at the National Ski Areas Association.

Since Epic’s debut, three more passes have appeared on the domestic and international ski scene: Mountain Collective, which celebrates its 10th season this year; Alterra Mountain Company’s Ikon Pass (2018-19); and Indy Pass (2019-2020). The passes are more complementary than competitive.

Advertisement

Stan Gale, a ski and snow sports safety consultant based in Colorado, buys Ikon and Epic passes, which do not overlap. The Ikon and Mountain Collective passes share a few resorts, such as Aspen Snowmass in Colorado, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Wyoming, Montana’s Big Sky and Valle Nevado in Chile. However, for skiers and boarders who can’t telecommute, one pass could suffice.

To decipher the quartet, and their cost efficiency, we took a deep powder dive into the world of ski passes.

The Big Four multi-resort passes

The Epic Pass

Vail Resorts created the abominable snowman of multi-resort passes, with full access at 41 ski destinations in 15 states and four countries, including Canada, Switzerland and Australia, whose season occurs opposite the Northern Hemisphere’s. The pass also offers limited access for a set number of days at 40 partner resorts, such as Telluride in Colorado, Switzerland’s Verbier 4 Vallées and Rusutsu Resort in Japan.

Advertisement

Pass holders also receive 20 percent off such extras as food and drinks, lodging, equipment rentals and lessons; discounted tickets for friends and family members; and Epic Coverage, a refund policy that applies when customers face such adversities as injury or job loss.

Of all the Vail Resorts passes, the Epic Pass is the most bountiful — and the most expensive, at $949 for adults ages 19 and older. For vacationers with fewer snow days or tighter budgets, Vail Resorts has several other options, such as the Epic Local, a trimmed-down version of Epic Pass for $735; the Epic Day Pass, which covers one to seven days at 22, 32 or 38 resorts in North America and Europe (from $51); and regional passes, such as the Northeast Value Pass for $557.

Pricing is tiered, so the earlier you commit, the more you save. In the spring, for instance, the Epic Pass cost $841. Drag your ski boot heels for too long and you could completely miss out: Vail Resorts already cut off pass sales for this season on Dec. 4.

Ikon Pass

The Ikon Pass resembles Epic, but with resorts owned by Alterra and its associates. Pass-holders can take advantage of unlimited skiing and riding at 14 destinations in Colorado, California, West Virginia, Vermont, Utah and Canada, including such stalwarts as Steamboat in Colorado, Stratton in Vermont and Tremblant in Quebec. The plan also includes up to a seven days of skiing at nearly 40 partner resorts around the world, plus a First Tracks program, 25 percent off companion tickets and 15 percent off food, drinks and shopping.

The pass costs $1,229 for customers 23 and older. For less pricey alternatives, the Ikon Base Pass, a scaled-back version of its main pass, goes for $919, and the customizable Ikon Session Pass 4-Day is $519.

Like Epic, the pass favors early-bird shoppers, who save $150 by buying in the spring. The sale period for all passes closes Dec. 8.

Mountain Collective and Indy Pass

Mountain Collective and Indy Pass differ from Epic and Ikon on several counts. For one, instead of an unlimited skiing approach, the passes offer vacationers two days at each resort, plus a discount for extra days — 25 percent off the third day with Indy Pass and 50 percent of all subsequent days with Mountain Collective.

“A woman did 20 resorts last year,” said Todd Burnette, chief executive of Mountain Collective, which encompasses 25 resorts in seven countries. “But to get the most value, you just have to ski at least four days at two resorts.”

Advertisement

Another difference: The resorts affiliated with the passes are not part of a big conglomerate. They are the ski industry’s version of the boutique property or the family-run inn.

“The Mountain Collective was a response to the Epic Pass,” Burnette said. “They have a loose association: They are independent resorts and not owned by a corporate entity.”

However, autonomous does not mean anonymous. The collective’s resorts include such illustrious slopes as Aspen Snowmass, Chamonix-Mont-Blanc in France and Lake Louise in Alberta, Canada. Many of the Indy Pass’s 120-plus resorts in North America and Japan are small regional favorites that often appear on high school trip permission slips and winter weekend itineraries, such as Massanutten Resort in Virginia and Schuss Mountain at Shanty Creek in Michigan. The Indy Pass also endears itself to cross-country skiers, with passes that also include two days of skiing at 20 Nordic centers in the U.S. and Canada, or a XC-only pass for $69.

Advertisement

The pair also dangle incentives to buy early. In March and April, the Mountain Collective pass costs $539 — $60 less than the current price — and includes a bonus third day at a resort of the skier’s choice. The pass is on sale until Dec. 12. The Indy Pass is available through mid-March, but the $349 and $449 price, depending on pass type, will increase by $20 on Dec. 31.

How to choose the right pass for you

The first question is: Do you even need a pass? The answer is yes if:

You plan to spend at least a week or a several weekends skiing or snowboarding, especially at some of the pricier resorts.

You want to try out several mountains in one season or are committed to chasing down the powder wherever it may fall.

You have strict vacation time, because some resorts sell out of online tickets but will still welcome pass-holders. (Note: Aspen Snowmass, Jackson Hole and Big Sky require pass-holders to make reservations.)

The answer is maybe not if your winter calendar is so packed, you can only slip away for a day or two.

“It’s a good option for people because it makes ski trips more affordable than going up to the ticket window,” Mountain Collective’s Burnette said. “But you need to visit two resorts for at least four days to get a good value.”

Advertisement

To help with the decision, Gale suggests asking yourself a series of questions, such as “What do you envision your winter looking like?” and “How often do you plan to ski, and where?” and “How much can you spend on these trips?”

“You really need to tailor it to your budget and time off,” he said.

If all of your answers are pass-affirming, the next step is choosing one. Epic and Ikon are ideal for skiers and snowboarders who expect to spend a chunk of the season strapped to their board or planks. Between the two, pick the pass that features your favorite resorts or mountains that you have always aspired to conquer. Proximity to home is also key.

“Epic and Ikon reach a broader audience,” Isaac said. “They allow for exploration and flexibility.”

Mountain Collective boasts a more curated sampler’s box of resorts, which Isaac describes as “bucket-list.” “They’re not trying to be anyone else,” she said.

Advertisement

Indy Pass, meanwhile, caters to families, novice skiers and riders, and visitors more apt to jump in their car than a plane to get their shred on.

“It fits a niche for people looking for more of a ski-area experience than a resort,” she said.

Of course, the truly indecisive — or ambitious — can double up on passes. You can do the math while waiting in the lift ticket line, or in between gasps over your December-April credit card bills.

448,America’s airport glow-up,"Listen Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share

For many years, going to the airport in the United States has meant trudging through dark and low-ceilinged terminals, crowding in dreary security checkpoints and throwing elbows to secure one of the few power outlets at the gate. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight “A bus depot is not a great way to describe it, but that’s kind of the methodology that a lot of American passengers saw,” said Ty Osbaugh, an architect who helps lead the aviation practice at the architecture firm Gensler.

Airports built in the 20th century were largely designed to get customers in, out and through as quickly as possible. They didn’t account for the high volume of passengers we see today or the logistical demands the age of Homeland Security would create. According to the trade group Airports Council International-North America, the average airport terminal in the United States is more than 40 years old.

Advertisement

That’s not the case overseas, where some of the world’s grandest airports are designed for passengers to actually enjoy their experience. In Singapore’s Changi Airport, for example, a towering indoor waterfall, forested walking trails and a glass-bottom bridge compete for travelers’ attention. It’s given many Americans “terminal envy,” Osbaugh said.

Now, U.S. airports are catching on with a wave of modernization projects. With the urgency higher than ever — U.S. airports are in need of $115 billion in improvements, according to a 2021 survey by the airport trade association — and an injection of funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law, there’s new money and momentum for version “2.0 of airport design,” Osbaugh said.

“I think we’re always going to be in a constant need to upgrade,” said Kevin Burke, president and CEO of Airports Council International-North America. “Not all airports are going to be modernized at the same time.”

To get a better understanding of the design trends that will define our airport experience in the future, The Washington Post examined renovations that are either in progress or were recently completed at six U.S. airports: Orlando International, Los Angeles International, Dallas Fort Worth International, Portland International, Pittsburgh International and New York City’s LaGuardia Airport.

Bright open spaces, high-tech bathrooms

Airports across the country are investing billions to help passengers “look forward to the time they spend at the airport, instead of just really hating it,” said Harriet Baskas, creator of the blog Stuck at the Airport.

At Dallas Fort Worth International, four new gates that opened over the summer as part of a $2 billion expansion to Terminal C are designed to help customers relax in comfort, said Khaled Naja, the airport’s executive vice president for infrastructure and development. Naja said the new “High C” gates feature high ceilings; large, tinting windows that let in copious natural light; and seating areas designed both for solo business travelers who need a quiet space to work and families or larger groups. Every seat features a wireless charger.

At Portland International Airport in Oregon, a new main terminal set to open in 2025 as the centerpiece of a $1.5 billion project is laid out like an indoor version of a small town’s main street. It will feature wide corridors lined by trees and local shops and restaurants. Pittsburgh International Airport’s new $1.4 billion terminal, which is under construction and scheduled to open in 2025, will include outdoor terraces both pre- and post-security.

Advertisement

“We want people to have access to fresh air,” said Christina Cassotis, CEO of the Allegheny County Airport Authority.

LaGuardia’s Terminal B opened its final two gates in July as part of an $8 billion overhaul for the airport. Developers wanted to build a space that felt more like a “nice hotel” than a transportation hub, said Stewart Steeves, chief operating officer of Vantage Airport Group, part of the group that is redeveloping and managing the terminal. That means using tile on the floor instead of the more institutional-seeming terrazzo, incorporating art in the check-in area, providing “hotel-style” baggage carts that are less loud and using sound-absorbing materials.

On the way to gates, there are indoor parks with plants and trees and children’s play areas where kids can customize a plane on a tablet, then watch it fly on a giant digital screen. These are “in-between” spaces where people feel removed from a boarding lounge, Steeves said.

DFW’s new gates also feature massive digital signs that can be seen from a distance and indicate the status of a flight, meaning customers never have to rush to the gate to check on their flight, Naja said. In the meantime, they can visit the terminal’s new “smart restrooms,” which include digital indicators as to whether each stall is occupied.

Long maligned as one of the worst parts of travels, airport bathrooms have seen significant improvements in recent years. Philadelphia International received $24 million from the bipartisan infrastructure law to overhaul 30 restrooms, and the facilities in Tampa International’s Airside C — which feature a clean, contemporary aesthetic and personal paper towel dispensers and trash cans at each sink — were recently named the nation’s best restrooms by Cintas, beating out spas and top restaurants.

Steeves is enthusiastic about the restrooms in LaGuardia’s Terminal B, where stalls were designed to fit a human and a suitcase without requiring a contortion act to reach the toilet.

Creating a ‘sense of place’

Several airports are focusing on highlighting the city they serve, adding some local flavor into drab facilities that may seem to exist in a kind of geographic purgatory.

Advertisement

In Pittsburgh, the roof has been designed to represent the area’s rolling hills. Steel columns that look like trees are meant to “provide an aesthetic sense of place, evoking the woods of Western Pennsylvania,” the airport says.

A 9-acre wood roof in Portland’s forthcoming main terminal marks a first in airport construction. Built in a lattice of exposed wood sourced from a 300-mile radius of the city, the roof is more sustainable and seismically resilient than steel, Port of Portland chief projects officer Vince Granato said. It’s designed to be “like a walk in the forest, which is what we’re famous for out here,” he said. “It’s like a tree canopy with lots of skylights.”

At Orlando International Airport’s new $2.8 billion Terminal C, which started welcoming flights in September, an “open, airy environment” was the goal, said Greater Orlando Aviation Authority CEO Kevin Thibault. Skylights allow sun to filter through the high ceiling that towers over a portion of the terminal; below, “forever trees” using preserved material from palm and cypress trees line the walkway.

Advertisement

“What we did was try to create that type of environment … so you know you’re in the Sunshine State,” he said.

Technology that makes IDs obsolete

Imagine an airport experience where you can go from the curb to the gate without pulling out your boarding pass or a phone, or without even slowing down.

That’s the future that advancements in technology might be able to offer within a decade, Osbaugh said. With facial recognition tech, passengers will be able to place their bag on a belt themselves, walk through security, purchase concessions and board their flight without a physical ID.

Already, the Transportation Security Administration is testing facial recognition technology at 16 airports across the country, a rollout that has generated some controversy, The Washington Post reported. In other seemingly sci-fi moves, Delta unveiled technology at Detroit Metropolitan Airport this summer that shows travelers their personalized flight information on a giant shared screen. The “Parallel Reality” has not yet expanded to other airports.

Some futuristic features are already in place at Los Angeles International as part of the airport’s broader digital transformation initiative, including self-service bag drops and boarding with facial scans on international flights, according to Justin Erbacci, the CEO of Los Angeles World Airports.

“We’re at the forefront of the use of biometrics here to make the passenger journey more secure, but also easier and contactless for the customer,” he said.

LAX is also aiming to make it possible for a passenger to control their entire airport journey through their phone, including a smart parking system that guides drivers to an open spot, the ability to reserve a time to go through the security checkpoint instead of queuing, and mobile food ordering so passengers can skip the line at Starbucks, Erbacci said.

Pittsburgh International Airport has created a testing platform called the xBridge to pilot tech innovations like food delivery robots, semiautonomous vehicles for shuttling employees and an installation that uses algae to reduce carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.

At Orlando International Airport’s new terminal, each gate has biometric screening devices. That means all international passengers can use facial recognition technology instead of showing boarding passes. Thibault said the airport has been working with the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection with the goal of using the same technology for domestic flights.

Advertisement

At TSA checkpoints, bins are automatically brought to the screening area and returned. If someone leaves anything inside after going through a checkpoint, a sensor will not allow it to return.

“All that has streamlined the processing so we are efficiently putting passengers through the security lanes,” Thibault said.

New construction methods

One factor limiting airport modernizations across the country is space, especially at city airports like LaGuardia. To solve that problem, engineers for LaGuardia’s new Terminal B built vertically, with food and shops on the fourth level down to ground transportation on the first.

Osbaugh said LaGuardia will be a “test bed” for future terminals which might be even taller.

“It’s kind of like the Guggenheim, where you start on the upper level and you just kind of spiral down,” he said. “You can then start to use the verticality of the space to create different zones for passengers and let them choose what they want to do.”

In the first project of its kind for an airport terminal, Dallas Fort Worth built its new High C gates using modular construction, meaning the building was constructed elsewhere on the airport, carried on modified NASA transporters overnight and set onto a foundation, Naja said.

Advertisement

The construction process — which Naja said has been used for airport bridges and connectors, but not a terminal — allowed the airport to finish the new gates four months early and under budget. It also never had to shut down existing parts of its terminal or impact flight operations.

Self-powered airports

To meet a Biden administration goal that the aviation industry reaches net-zero emissions by 2050, the Federal Aviation Administration is offering grants to U.S. airports to put clean tech projects in place, develop sustainability plans and buy zero-emissions cars, buses and other vehicles.

New building projects are turning to solutions like reflective glass for energy efficiency and different sources of fuel for air conditioning and heat, Burke said. On the airfield, more are using battery-powered vehicles than those powered by diesel.

Dallas Fort Worth is already the “largest carbon-neutral airport in the world,” and is aiming to have net-zero emissions by 2030, Naja said. LAX is aiming for net-zero by 2045, according to Erbacci.

The Pittsburgh airport has already gone “off the grid,” Cassotis said, powered through nearly 10,000 solar panels and natural gas wells on the property. She said the airport has already realized $2 million in cost savings as a result.

On a smaller scale, the Orlando airport now has 360 floating solar panels, which it calls “a first step in the evaluation of using renewable energy.”

LaGuardia’s new Terminal B has earned LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, a measure for sustainable construction. According to a news release, nearly all of the debris recycled from the terminal’s garage demolition went to new construction. The terminal was designed in a way to reduce energy costs 18 percent and reach water savings of more than 43 percent.

b. Recurring Billing.

You acknowledge that the amount charged each Billing Period may vary for reasons that may include price changes, changing your subscription, or changes in applicable taxes, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amount each Billing Period. Applicable taxes may vary. For example, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method the promotional rate disclosed on the subscription screen for the agreed upon promotional Billing Periods (if applicable) and the regular subscription rate in subsequent Billing Periods, each with applicable taxes. We automatically bill your Payment Method on the last day of each Billing Period. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, in the event your Payment Method has not successfully settled. If your Payment Method is declined for a recurring payment of your subscription fee, you have four (4) days to provide us a new Payment Method or your subscription will be canceled.

If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain the free trial, you will be required to provide a Payment Method in order to ensure uninterrupted access and continued use after the expiration of the free trial. Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a recurring paid subscription and your Payment Method will be charged the applicable fee unless you have cancelled your subscription before your free trial ends. You may cancel your subscription during your free trial to avoid being charged as described above; such cancellation may be effective immediately.

You may only be permitted to use one free trial or promotional rate offer. If your subscription is ever cancelled or terminated for any reason, and you purchase an additional subscription, you may not be eligible for a free trial or to take advantage of another promotional rate.

5. Cancellations and Refunds

a. Cancellations. You can cancel your subscription at any time by going to My Account.

Cancellation only applies to future charges associated with your subscription, and you will not receive a refund for the current Billing Period. Your cancellation will become effective at the end of your current Billing Period, and you will continue to have access to your subscription for the remainder of the Billing Period (except that if you cancel your subscription during a free trial period, your cancellation may become effective immediately).

Published September 16, 2016 Online advertising for washingtonpost.com is delivered by the vendor DoubleClick. DoubleClick places cookies on your browser to facilitate serving particular ads – for instance, to help determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, to tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies for these purposes by visiting http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/.

In some cases, we and advertisers on washingtonpost.com and other sites work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements tailored to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and audience segment providers, and they use cookies, beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited and mobile apps you use) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads on our site and other sites that they believe you would find most relevant. You can opt out of those vendors’ use of cookies to tailor advertising to you by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/.

Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.

Often our advertisers contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service for a particular advertisement. In that case, an independent cookie may be used by the third-party service. We do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt-out of cookies from vendors with whom we do not have a contractual relationship.

An ass that weak should not sit behind the Resolute desk. It’s the flat ass from hell. What a disgrace. It’s disrespectful, and frankly, it’s un-American.” At press time, Trump was urging House Republicans to open a special investigation into where Biden even got pants that small.

Oh, cool, that’s great. I’m okay with my job. Definitely like some parts. Some parts not so much.

It was a different time, and from my recollection, the segregation that day was perfectly innocent. It is very troubling to witness a media pile-on against a reasonable, upstanding form of systemic discrimination.” Jones also responded to criticism that he has never hired a Black head coach, stating that the media always omitted the important context that he doesn’t believe Black people are smart enough to do the job.

Though the smell of burning flesh filled the air the moment his fingertips touched the sauce, and the tears streaming from his eyes evaporated with a sizzle upon the heat of his cheeks, Perkins is said to have declined multiple offers of water. Witnesses confirmed he did this by shaking his head, his ability to speak having been compromised once the wing dressing had dissolved enough muscle tissue to leave his jawbone dangling from a single, thinning tendon. Shortly before suffering multiple organ failure, Perkins reportedly wrote on a napkin that if the restaurant didn’t have anything hotter, he would simply have to pour more sauce onto his next bite to compensate for “this weak shit” he had been served.",https://www.theonion.com/it-s-not-too-bad-says-man-as-hot-sauce-begins-disint-1849797274,2022-12-02T16:55:00.274000+00:00
488,Man Afraid To Get Tattoo In Case He Feels Differently About His Children In 10 Years,"WATERLOO, IA—Stating that “you never know what could happen down the road,” local man James Kenney told reporters Wednesday that he was afraid to get a tattoo of his children’s names in case he felt different about them in 10 years. “It’s easy to get caught up in the moment in the delivery room, but what about next year? Next decade? Am I still going to love my sons then?” said Kenney, who expressed fear that the sight of his newborn twins’ names on his arms would one day only bring him pain and regret. “I’m not saying I’m afraid of commitment to my children. It’s just that people change, you know? I could always get them covered up with the cat’s name, but that can be expensive.” At press time, Kenney added that he would only get the tattoos if his infant sons got a tattoo of his name in return.

Thanks to this law, we can guarantee that no engineer driving 20,000 tons of freight across this great nation will be able to access healthcare without having their pay docked.” Biden went on to express confidence that next year, bipartisan legislation would be passed to ensure rail workers were no longer allowed to eat or sleep between shifts.",https://www.theonion.com/biden-signs-legislation-to-avert-crisis-of-treating-rai-1849847966,2022-12-02T20:40:00.966000+00:00
491,Right-Wingers Criticize Kanye For Not Using Platform To Raise Awareness Of Lesser-Known Nazis,"WASHINGTON—Saying the musician’s behavior in the past weeks had been a deep disappointment, far-right commentators criticized Kanye West on Friday for not using his platform to raise awareness of the many lesser-known Nazis. “Ye had a clear educational opportunity to shed light on forgotten figures from the National Socialist Party’s history—brilliant racists like Rudolf Jung and Hermann Göring—and yet he chose the single Nazi we all know best,” said right-wing podcaster Andrew Hampton, one of many conservative writers who expressed frustration, stating that West had misused his Infowars appearances to restate their already well-established admiration for the Führer. “Look, I get it. We all love Hitler. But what about all the budding antisemites who could be inspired in the mission to exterminate Jews, Blacks, and the disabled? Why not talk about Leni Riefenstahl or Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, so some little girl can grow up in their proud Jew-hating footsteps? There’s such a robust well of hatred in the Nazi Party. It’s a shame to focus on just one super obvious guy.” Hampton added that for that matter, Kanye might also remind his fans about America’s many homegrown Nazis, like Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and David Duke.

If we can just keep them applauding when the sign says ‘applause,’ then we can keep them from committing crimes.” Adams went on to acknowledge that while many in The Tonight Show’s new audience would suffer from psychological disturbances that caused them to laugh at inappropriate times, the same was true of Jimmy Fallon.",https://www.theonion.com/eric-adams-resumes-placing-mentally-ill-people-into-aud-1849837005,2022-11-30T20:30:00.005000+00:00

4 / 26 “Just pretend you’re on something that could never possibly crash, like the Hindenburg or the Titanic.” List slides “Just pretend you’re on something that could never possibly crash, like the Hindenburg or the Titanic.” You really need to study your history more carefully. Advertisement

7 / 26 “My cousin is a pilot, and he’s only crashed the plane and killed everyone on board, like, three times.” List slides “My cousin is a pilot, and he’s only crashed the plane and killed everyone on board, like, three times.” This is one of those things that only sounds reassuring in your head.

Meanwhile, I am in a dank basement, I’m strapped to a cold metal chair, and I haven’t slept or eaten in days.



All of this is to stress that you bastards can do your worst to me, but I’ll never tell you whether I think Joe Biden should run in 2024.

You hear that, you stupid sons of bitches? You want me to talk? You want my read on current polling? You’re going to have to do much worse than tearing off my fingernails to get a peep out of me on President Biden’s favorability numbers and accomplishments in office.

What are you doing with that towel and jug of water? Do you stupid pricks seriously think I’ll discuss my take on alternative Democratic frontrunners just because of some little-bitty waterboarding? Bring it on. Pour that water all over me. Blegh, blegh, blegh. Goddamn it! I can’t breath—blegh, blegh, blegh. That all you got? Blegh, blegh, blegh.

Keep it coming, you pissants!

Did you seriously think that would break me, you fuckers? Hell no. I’m made of harder stuff than that. In fact, you should just put that revolver in your belt right against my temple and pull the trigger if you think I’m going to divulge whether I believe Joe Biden could handle the pressure of campaigning. And frankly, I welcome death if it means you’ll never know if I think Kamala Harris could provide a suitable replacement in 2024.

Oh, looks like you’re getting out the rusty pair of pliers. Gonna go to work on my mouth, huh, boys? Well, good luck. I’ve got plenty of teeth, but I don’t have a single word I’ll spit out about how divided Americans feel toward bipartisanship.

Look, would it be easier to just write down 350 words featuring my prognostications for the 2024 presidential election? Of course. I haven’t had a drop of water to drink in nearly a month. I am hallucinating constantly from sleep loss. The rectal feeding I could stand, but somehow being awoken every time I near sleep by Bruce Springsteen’s campaign song “We Take Care Of Our Own” played at deafening volumes—well, that nearly broke me.

Still, I would never be able to live with myself if I gave you assholes what you wanted. When I first woke up in this frigid subterranean cell, I knew the only way I could retain my sanity was to hold fast to my ethics. A man with a “why” can survive any “how.” And so I have taken the testicular electrocutions in stride. I have laughed at them, in fact. Ha-ha! It is far better to be sterilized with jumper cables than to ever speak my piece on how a looming recession and fluctuating gas prices could present headwinds for Democrats.

So go ahead and spit on me. Strangle me. Strip me naked and dog-walk me across the cement floor on a metal leash. Threaten my wife and children. Hell, murder my entire family. Nothing—nothing—will break my resolve. I will never reveal whether I believe Biden will have the mental and physical ability at 81 years of age to retain the most powerful office in the world.

501,American Presidents Serve 4-Year Terms,"It is tempting, when faced with the question of whether Joe Biden should run in 2024 to consider this question in isolation. Should President Biden run again? But is this even the right question? Over the past several years, I’ve studied the American people in great detail by reading articles about them in this newspaper and several other newspapers. In doing so, I have been forced to worry that we as a nation have lost sight of the facts that really matter.



The stakes are high. And for all Americans, it should be unequivocally clear: United States presidents serve four-year terms.



Advertisement

Four years. That’s more than one. More than two, even. But fewer years than five or six. As the 2024 election looms, we would do well to remember that.



To say an American president serves a four-year term may be cancel-worthy to those on the defiant right and recalcitrant left who blanch at any effort to seek common ground. But to find copious examples of four-year presidential terms, we need look no further than U.S. history. George Washington served a four-year term—two of them, in fact. Abraham Lincoln served a four-year term, and was preparing to serve another one until his assassination in Ford’s Theatre. In the twentieth century alone, 18 different men served as president, and each time one was elected, it was to—you guessed it—a four-year term. That’s something that we as a nation should not lose sight of, even in our darkest hour.



Four years. That’s 208 weeks. We could also call this 35,064 hours. An hour is much less than a year. There are 8,760 hours in a year, in fact. We must, as a nation, keep in mind just how many hours are in a year.



I worry that in these outraged, polarized, 24/7 times, where we believe that Twitter is real life but that taking a long Saturday to paint a fence with your grandfather isn’t, we have forgotten precisely what a year is. The word “year” comes from the Greek word hōra, meaning “season.” We are experiencing such a season in America today: a scabrous, polarizing season. The polarizing right and the equally polarizing left are fighting over the direction in which our country is headed. This polarization threatens to keep us polarized. I worry that if we can’t agree on basic facts, the year will come when we will no longer agree, as a nation, on how many years are in a presidential term.

Advertisement

There are four.

That’s right. Count ’em: One. Two. Three. Four.



Okay, stop there. There aren’t any more years than four in a presidential term. The irony, of course, is that four years is exactly how long a presidential term lasts.



But serving a presidential term is not the only thing a president does. They are also a person before, and often after, they are president. The average American lifespan is much longer than any four-year presidential term, a point that I see very few people these days willing to make. One wonders whether the clarion of cancel culture is having a chilling effect. But the Founding Fathers, in their boundless wisdom, had it right in many ways. One of those ways was Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, which declares the length of a presidential term: four years.

Advertisement

The vice president also serves a four-year term.

So what of Biden? Right now, Biden is in the middle of a four-year term. If he runs again in 2024 and is reelected, he will be signing up to serve for another four years. But this is a bigger question than Biden, or whoever happens to be on the ballot in 2024. It’s the question of who we are as Americans, where we want to go as a nation, and how many years are in a presidential term.



As of now, there are four. And we should all endeavor to count them.",https://www.theonion.com/american-presidents-serve-4-year-terms-1849716586,2022-11-01T12:00:00.586000+00:00
502,It’s Ageist To Suggest A Corpse Can’t Be A Great Leader,"As the discussion rages over whether or not Joe Biden—our oldest president to date at age 79—should run for a second term in 2024, there is one glaring and pernicious aspect of the debate I demand we put a stop to at once. That is the suggestion that a corpse is not capable of being a great leader.



Simply put, it is ageist to suggest that a political figure cannot serve admirably just because their body is writhing with maggots or swollen with postmortem gases. Indeed, I challenge anyone to name one legitimate reason not to elevate a decaying carcass to the highest office in the land.

Advertisement

I’ll wait, but I don’t think you’ll find one.

As a centenarian more than fives times over, I’ve heard every defamatory comment there is about how merely having a small patch of skull exposed or losing an eyeball to ravenous worms somehow renders me a second-class citizen. This ancient prejudice implies my status as a moldering corpse is a disability that makes me lesser than someone who, by sheer happenstance, is still covered in rosy flesh.

This is not merely discriminatory. It’s also a slap in the face to the many corpses who made this country great.

These days, people see a few flies swarming around a decomposing body and assume that person is not capable of holding a basic conversation without their lower jaw falling off, let alone able to thrive as commander-in-chief. Last time I checked, intelligence isn’t stored in the flesh, and jaw bones pop right back into place.

Advertisement

It’s incredible that in the year 2022, our society still treats dead bodies as a rotting burden they no longer want around. In fact, the second corpses start showing signs of rigor mortis, we are shunned by our supposed loved ones, expelled from our homes, and dumped into our solitary underground graves, out of sight, where our needs and desires are buried alongside us.

Nay. No more.

History proves that being alive is not in and of itself a valid indicator of whether or not a person is qualified to serve: Nelson Mandela is a corpse. As is Martin Luther King Jr. And lest we forget, one of the most beloved presidents of the 20th century, John F. Kennedy, was a corpse while in office. Yet today all we hear is that candidates need to be “younger,” “fresher,” and “still alive.”

So while I agree that our 79-year-old current president is far from perfect, and it is well within our rights to say so, I’m asking you, my fellow countrymen, to strip these critiques of their blatant ageism toward those with foul-smelling, putrefied flesh, and focus instead on the content of your leader’s character.

503,MLB Owners Hold Separate Meeting For Teams Actually Trying To Win Next Season,"SAN DIEGO—Following a long day of conferences on potential rule changes and other league business, MLB owners reportedly held a separate meeting Monday for teams actually trying to win next season. “It’s a small group, but it’s nice to get together for a more intimate conversation among the teams that are actually attempting to assemble a talented roster that could win a World Series,” said Houston Astros owner Jim Crane, adding that they enjoyed not having to deal with the annoying concerns of the owners who were just trying to make money off their teams. “Don’t get me wrong, we want to make a lot of money too, and we do, but in the regular meetings you talk to a guy like [Chicago Cubs owner] Tom Ricketts or [Anaheim Angels owner] Arte Moreno, and it’s clear that they don’t have any interest in actually getting good players. That’s fine, but there’s maybe a dozen of us who are actually trying to win.” At press time, the group was surprised when their meeting was interrupted by the late arrival of Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who expressed his annoyance that, despite his best efforts, the team’s roster was actually pretty good and he was desperate for the other owners to take his good players off his hands.

504,New World Cup Fan Frantically Searching Online For Any Information He Can Find On Country Of ‘United States’,"BETHESDA, MD—Trying to learn more information about the team he recently decided to root for, new World Cup fan Brian Edman was frantically searching online Friday for any information he could find on the country of the United States. “This is my first time getting into the World Cup and I didn’t know who to root for, so I decided to just pick some random country and settled on the United States, but I don’t really know anything about their culture, so I’m trying to learn,” said Edman, who was reportedly spending most of his workday scouring Wikipedia pages for the United States and some of its major people and historical events so he could talk somewhat intelligently his friends about it when they watch tomorrow’s match. “There are a bunch of cool teams out there, like Cameroon and Senegal, but during the round of 64 I decided to just go with the U.S. Did you know that the United States has 50 stars on their flag? And that their national bird is the bald eagle? It’s pretty sweet. I’ve also been looking online at pictures from some of their big cities, like New York City and Los Angeles, and trying to imagine what it’s like to live there. Maybe someday I’ll get to visit! But for now, it’s just fun to cheer on this random country, even if I have no connection to it.” Edman admitted that his United States fandom had its downsides, as he was having trouble pronouncing some of the “weird-ass names” of the country’s players, like “Tyler Adams” and “Jordan Morris.”
